The Yellowhammer Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

In addition, operating  and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops a recommendation to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Yellowhammer Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the Yellowhammer Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Yellowhammer Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Yellowhammer Plant.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 years there have been no accidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURE INFORMATION\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures addresses notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Yellowhammer Plant facility.  The emergency procedure changes"

      "SummaryText": "1.0 Yellowhammer Plant Risk Management Plan:  Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Shell Offshore Inc. (SOI) Yellowhammer Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The SOI policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nSOI owns and operates the Yellowhammer Plant located in Mobile County, Alabama. The Yellowhammer Plant receives produced natural gas from the Fairway Field via pipeline.  The facility processes the inlet gas to remove hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and water.  Hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, also known as acid gas are routed to the Claus Sulfur Recovery Unit where liquid sulfur is produced. The offgas is treated in the Offgas Treating Unit to improve sulfur recovery efficiency and the remaining gas is incinerated.  Residue gas is removed from the plant by pipeline. The natural gas liquids (NGLs) at the Yellowhammer Plant are removed from the gas by refrigeration and shipped out via tank trucks to customers' plants where they are fractionated.\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, SOI identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Yellow-hammer Plant are NGLs, condensate, propane and natural gas.  However, SOI has determined that condensate has an NFPA flammability hazard rating of 3 which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  Based on"

In addition, the Yellowhammer Plant is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the Yellowhammer Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Yellowhammer Plant.  Because the processes at  the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Yellowhammer Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Health Safety and Environmental Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)"

      "SummaryText": "The Yellowhammer Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n The Yellowhammer Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant maintains written procedures th"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures the Yellowhammer Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner,"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety  and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Yellowhammer Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety  Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Yellowhammer Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nM"
