On June 1, 2009, the nylon division of Solutia, including the Pensacola site, was purchased by SK Capital Partners (SK), and became a wholly owned subsidiary of SK, given the name Ascend Performance Materials, LLC (Ascend). The Pensacola Plant is one of the five chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company's assets within the Unites States. Ascend has approximately 2300 US-based employees. \r\n\r\nBuilt in 1953, the Pensacola Plant is situated on a 1900 acre tract, 12 miles north of the City of Pensacola, on the Escambia River. Over 600 acres are presently in use for manufacturing.\r\n\r\nStaffing at Pensacola is currently 916 Ascend employees and 400 permanent contract employees.\r\n\r\nAscend is one of the world's largest producers of nylon polymer chips for the automotive and electrical industries, as well as nylon for carpet staple. Some of the adipic acid produced on-site is sold outside the nylon markets, where it goes into food additives, such as for Jell-O and No Salt to provide tartness. The facility also produces maleic anhydride, which utilizes butane as a raw material. The maleic anhydride facility is owned by Huntsman Corp., but staffed and run by Ascend personnel.\r\n\r\nThe site has two regulated substances: Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane. Most of the major raw materials used in the manufacturing operations, including Anhydrous Ammonia and Butane, arrive at the plant by barge on the Escambia River which is 7 miles from the intercostal waterway.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is primarily received by barge, and it remains under the carrier's control. The largest Ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "barge contains 5 million pounds. Although we have never had more than one barge of ammonia on site, we believe there could be situations warranting two. Additionally, we have the capability of receiving Ammonia via tanker truck to support a selective catalytic reduction emissions control device in the event that the Ammonia Transfer Header is offline due to low Ammonia inventory or extended maintenance and/or inspections.\r\n\r\nRail and truck shipments of butane can be used to supplement the barges. Butane barges can hold up to a maximum of 3.3 million pounds each, remain under the control of the carrier, and normally there are no more than two barges on site at any one time. The plant has the capability to receive rail cars of butane, with the largest containing 160,000 pounds. Tanker trucks of butane are occasionally unloaded, with the largest containing 45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe plant also utilizes chlorine gas to treat the plant process and domestic water systems. All of the chlorine used in this operation is received into the plant in one-ton capacity cylinders and in 150 lb capacity bottles. The one-ton cylinders contain a maximum net weight of 1350 lbs. There is no more than one 1350 lb. cylinder at each of the two water treating systems. The chlorine inventories are therefore under the threshold quantity for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nAscend Performance Materials has made the following commitment, expressing our intention to operate responsibly:\r\n\r\nOur culture supports a Commitment to Zero. We believe it is possible to operate with zero incidents - zero personal injuries, zero process safety incidents and zero environmental releases. We strive to achieve excellence by accepting zero shortcuts, zero workarounds and zero tolerance for defects, and we work together as One Ascend to embrace this Commitment to Zero every day in everything we do.\r\n\r\nWe believe in preventing accidents befor"

Additionally, employees are thoroughly trained for their work and our manufacturing processes use state-of-the-art equipment, designed with the latest safety features.\r\n\r\nAscend endorses and supports the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care program - an international initiative that has helped chemical makers achieve one of the best safety performances of any industry in North America. The site achieved certification for our Responsible Care Management System in June, 2013.\r\n\r\nAscend has clear written policies regarding employee involvement in all aspects of safety which is specifically described by the Process Safety Workforce Involvement Policy ASC 0023.\r\n\r\nThe plant's written ESS&H procedures and standards are incorporated into two manuals. The first manual contains 120 plant wide procedures that are reviewed and revised at least every five years. The second manual contains area-specific procedures (over 125 in number) that are also reviewed and revised on a five-year cycle. So, on average, fifty procedures are reviewed and updated each year. The Safety Department manages the ESS&H Manual revision program.\r\n\r\nManagement demonstrates its leadership through facilitation and/or attendance at safety meetings, participation in 5S/Safety walkthroughs, support of employee engagement teams, permit audits, and compliance training. Communication is the key to the success of management commitment. The site managers utilize a variety of media (e.g., emails, critical life safety audits, attendance at various meetings) to convey their personal commitment that completing our work safely is the vision that we must continuously have in front of us each day.\r\n\r\nAscend uses several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely. These include PSM and non-PSM audits, ISO audits, insurance surveys"

We conduct safety reviews on new processes or process modifications at a number of stages of the project design and installation. Pre-startup inspections are completed before the process is commissioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThe Pensacola plant is very dedicated to emergency response preparation in the event of any major incident. The plant has almost 100 firefighters across all 4 shifts (25 per shift), giving 24/7 coverage.  These firefighters train 96 hours annually at the site on events such as flammable liquid fires, interior and exterior firefighting, hazardous communications, and incident command.  The firefighters also train at the Texas A&M fire training school and the Gulf Coast Emergency Response Training Academy.  The plant fire department has two Class A pumpers with foam capabilities to supplement the six fire pumps that take water from a 2 million gallon supply reservoir.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the plant has 17 EMTs training 48 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, and other medical topics. The plant also has one fully stocked ambulance for transportation to the plant medical clinic.\r\n\r\nAll firefighters are trained as Hazardous Materials technicians to respond to on-site chemical emergencies. These individuals are trained to handle both railcar and tanker truck emergencies. Additionally, the site purchased a new HAZMAT trailer in 2019 for use in emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe site maintains 155 separate sprinkler systems, 68 monitor nozzles, 96 hydrants, approximately 3500 fire extinguishers, and other protection equipment. The plant wide alarm system consists of 300 manual pull stations and 100 supervisory alarm systems. In addition to the plant wide alarm system, individual operator radios are used to communicate an emergency.\r\n\r\nAscend is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has a representative on the committee.
