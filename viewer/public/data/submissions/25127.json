      "SummaryText": "The Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Aurora Cooperative emergency response plan involves the response services available in the community.  Aurora Cooperative bulk Anhydrous Ammonia facilities have been strategically located to provide a local retail facility for this form of affordable nitrogen fertilizer for agriculture.  This facility located west of Clarks on U.S. Highway 30 is made up of one 18,000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel and one loadout riser.  Also stored at this location are up to 50 nurse tanks ranging in size from 1,000 to 1,500 gallons.  It serves the Merrick County area.  This facility is normally manned during business hours.  The offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the \"owner or operator shall assume...maximum quantity of the largest vessel...is released as a gas over a 10 minute period\", due to and unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is difined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia released before it's concentration decreases to a \"non-toxic\" level.  For this purpose, Aurora Cooperative has chosed to use RMP-Comp Version 1.05 to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (.14 mg/l or 200 ppm) and to determine the population affected by a potential release using maps extracted from Landview 3 software.  The worst case release scenario for Aurora Cooperative - Clarks facility involves the failure of the 18,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel while it contains 85% (maximum allowed capacity) of it's capacity.  The alternative release scenario is based "
