The Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies At Your Facility\n\nThe Salinas River Cogeneration Facility (SRCF) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. Applicable procedures of the State of California and United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) are adhered to, including training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. SRCF recognizes its responsibility to make employee, community and environmental protection an integral part of daily operations. It is committed to being a responsible member within the community by giving top priority to conducting operations in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of SRCF that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which to work. SRCF incorporates the concepts of environmental responsibility and with safety into all aspects of base operations. As part of SRCF's obligation to protect the integrity of human, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and efficiently utilize those resources, SRCF will: comply fully with laws regulating environmental protection and employee health and safety; furnish work places free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to people and the environment; train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations, policies, and procedures; and provide professional staff to maintain and support environmental, health, and safety programs.\n\n\n\n2.  Your Facility And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSRCF located in San Ardo, California in the County of Monterey. SRCF operates one natural gas fired combustion turbine generator. SRCF is a cogeneration plant that produces electricity and steam which is utilized for enhanced oil recovery. SRCF utilizes Selecti"

      "SummaryText": "ve Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology to reduce combustion Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions. SCR is a post-combustion flue gas NOx emission control technology that removes NOx from the flue gas downstream from the combustion process. A reducing agent is used to reduce NOx emissions by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst. Injection of the reducing agent/air mixture into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream from the stack. \n\n\n\nThe SRCF uses anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstracts Service #7664-41-7) as the reagent for the SCR system. The maximum amount stored on site is 28,400 lbs.  A single 15,000-gallon (69,960 lbs) anhydrous ammonia tank is provided to support the SCR at the SRCF. Maintenance and loading of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank has been contracted out. Transport of anhydrous ammonia to SRCF is accomplished using tanker trucks, with individual deliveries of no more than 5,000 gallons. Deliveries are scheduled every three to five weeks. The storage tank lies within an enclosed dike and is equipped with a deluge system. The deluge system is currently not in use.  In addition, the ammonia-handling facility is equipped with process area detectors to protect workers and equipment in the event of a malfunction. \n\n\n\nThe use of equipment for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia in support of the SRCF SCR system will require compliance with federal Risk Management Program (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP), Federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and California OHSA PSM. The quantity of ammonia on-site exceeds Federal RMP and CalARP threshold quantities. SRCF is required to implement a federal RMP plan pursuant to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. SRCF is also required to implement a CalARP plan pursuant to California Code of Regulation"

SRCF is required to implement a federal PSM plan pursuant to CFR, Title 29, Section 1910.119. The California PSM requirement is implemented pursuant to CCR, Title 8, Division 1, Chapter 4, Section 5189.  \n\n\n\nThe SRCF federal RMP plan is administered by US-EPA.  The CalARP plan is administered by the local administering agency (AA). In Monterey County, the AA is the local Certified Unified Program Agency - the Monterey County Health Department (MCDH). The RMP plan is submitted to both the US-EPA and MCDH. Additional information specific to CalARP is submitted to the MCDH. The RMP plan is submitted to US-EPA using the RMP*eSubmit program for online reporting. Copies are available on-site inside the Control Room Building at SRCF and easily accessible to employees and emergency personnel.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSRCF complies with federal and state RMP and PSM requirements, and is a key component of the SRCF prevention program. SRCF applies RMP and PSM processes to the entire plant. The SRCF RMP and PSM are updated as required to reflect changes in operating procedures. The plans at SRCF are based on the following key elements:\n\n?    Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n\n?    Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n\n?    Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n\n?    Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n?

The Five-Year Accident History\n\nSRCF has had no accidents with offsite consequences within the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan is includes specific actions to be taken by employees in response to the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance. The emergency responder is the Monterey County Fire Department and MCDH. The plan includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases, information on emergency health care, date of the most recent review or update of the emergency response plan, and date of the most recent emergency response training for employees. The name and telephone number of the local agency with which emergency response activities and the emergency response plan is coordinated is provided, along with a list of other federal or state emergency plan requirements to which SRCF is subject.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe hazards of the process were identified through interviews with plant personnel and during a HAZOP Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted on 4/4/2016. SRCF has adopted a reduced storage amount of ammonia as an additional safety measure."
