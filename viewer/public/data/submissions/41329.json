When the plant was originally built in 1938, it was a lime-soda softening plant which was then converted to a zeolite softening plant in 1956, and then to a conventional water treatment process in 1973.  A gaseous chlorine system is used for oxidation and disinfection of raw water. The facility is equipped with chlorine gas detectors.\n\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO Risk Management Program (RMP) RULE\n\n\n\nThe Avenue WTP uses chlorine in quantities above the federal RMP and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) thresholds.  One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are delivered to the WTP by truck.  Typically, the City stores a maximum of 10 one-ton chlorine cylinders onsite under a covered storage area and 4 one-ton chlorine cylinders within the chlorine dispensing room.  The covered storage area also has enough trunions to store an additional 5 one-ton cylinders.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELESES DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had any releases in the past 5 years that resulted in fatality, injury, offsite evacuation or property damage.\n\n\n\nPROCES SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Avenue WTP is subject to state and federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  The City has implemented a stringent PSM safety program that includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n* Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\n\n\n* Updates of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety.  All procedures are reviewed and certified annually.\n\n\n\n* Initial safety training and refresher training every 3 years for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n\n\n* Procedures "

The key elements of the Emergency Action Plan include:\n\n\n\n* All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n\n\n\n* The chlorine building is equipped with and electronic chlorine detector.  The chlorine detector has an audible alarm and alerts the City?s Central Operations control room in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\n* In the event of a large release, Central Operations would immediately contact the City of San Buenaventura Fire Department.\n\n\n\n* A team of City supervisors and operators are fully trained, certified, and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emergency operations to repair the source of an accidental release.  The Fire Department and the City Hazmat team would jointly participate in any such repair.\n\n\n\nRECENT STEPS TO IMPR"
