              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 1 - U.S. Amines:\n\nThe plant is subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and the EPA-RMP \n\nprogram.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA-RMP rule.  Amines Plant \n\nNo. 1 includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n1.  Ammonia\n2.  Isopropylamine\n3.  Dimethylamine\n\nAmmonia\n\nOperations of the storage locations for ammonia and the operations using ammonia fall under the site PSM program.  Ammonia is \n\nstored as a liquefied gas.  There are three storage tanks for pure ammonia which do not have storage containment dikes \n\nbecause diking would not contain the ammonia from evaporation.  Storage for ammonia within the process unit does include \n\ndiking as the ammonia stored in the process is not pure and diking would contain some of the material that would not \n\nimmediately evaporate.  \n\nIsopropylamine\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production of isopropylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations \n\nare covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume \n\nadequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nDimethylamine\n\nDimethylamine is not manufactured but is received from another producer, stored, and resold.  The storage locations are \n\ncovered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are diked with hold-up volume adequate to \n\ncontain all of the tank contents.\n\nThe site PSM program also has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP rules.  Some of those polices are listed \n\nbelow:\n\n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are \n\nneeded, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight \n\nhandle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation \n\nof risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel \n\n(LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory \n\nissues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water \n\nreservoir.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone \n\nsystems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.  The plant alarm system is tested weekly.\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.",

The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA-RMP rule.  Amines Plant \n\nNo. 2 includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n1.  Cyclohexylamine\n2.  Propionitrile\n\nCyclohexylamine\n\nOperations of these storage locations and production of cyclohexylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage \n\nlocations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with \n\nhold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.RMP specific to Amines Plant No. 1:\n\nPropionitrile\n\nOperations of the storage locations and production operations using propionitirle fall under the site PSM program.  The \n\nstorage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked \n\nwith hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.  Special personal protective equipment is used with \n\npropionitrile to prevent absorption of liquid or vapors into the skin.  The vapor space of the storage tank is purged with \n\nnitrogen to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere condition.\n\n\nThe site PSM program also has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP rules.  Some of those polices are listed \n\nbelow: \n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are \n\nneeded, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight \n\nhandle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation \n\nof risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the HAZOP only type of analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel \n\n(LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory \n\nissues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water \n\nreservoir.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone \n\nsystems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.  The plant alarm system is tested weekly.\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.",

Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a \"zero incident\" goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental incidents.\n\nThe US Amines Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nOur Facility:\n\nWe manufacture several different chemicals in the family of amines.  Our products are used to produce agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and drugs.  Our Isopropylamine is a chemical combination of isopropyl alcohol (the same chemical as in rubbing alcohol) and ammonia (the same chemical as in home floor cleaning products).  This is sold to other chemical manufacturers who make herbicides and agriculture products like popular home and farm product, RoundUp.  The chemicals that we handle and report on include the following RMP listed chemicals: Ammonia, Isopropylamine, Cyclohexylamine, Dimethylamine, and Propionitrile.  We also operate a fertilizer plant owned by IB Nitrogen, that is not covered by RMP.  We have about 45 site employees and 15 resident contractors.\n\nPlant Safety Activities:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.
