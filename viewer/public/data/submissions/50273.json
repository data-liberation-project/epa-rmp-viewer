The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Ag Partners Cooperative, Inc. - Padonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and retail sales of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 192,610 pounds in our 2-12,000 gallon storage tanks and 20-1000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.  In each of the following scenarios Ag Partners Coop has opted to consider our location as urban for dispersion modeling purposes.  The reason for this is that all tanks sit near large buildings, tall trees, and the facility as a whole sites in a valley.  All of these factors would help to limit the plume drift radius.\n\nA. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank and nurse tanks due to some catastrophic event like a derailed train striking and substantiallly damaging all anhydrous storage vessels causing a total release over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 192,000 pounds which represents the total volume of all tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5 miles.  Ag Partners realizes that this is a larger release quantity than the RMP requires; however, we feel that this truly represents a worse-case scenario.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is based on the most like"

If we assumed that possibly all of the tanks ontents could leak out over a two-hour period, the quantity released would be 11,908lbs.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nAg Partners Cooperative, Inc. has implemented a safety program that details the proper operations of the anhydrous ammonia facility, including step-by-step procedures for day-to-day operations as well as periodic checks to ensure proper equipment use and maintenance.  This program encorporates the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia?, and the Kansas Department of Agriculture.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
