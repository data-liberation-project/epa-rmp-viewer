Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Alto Terminal is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. and operated by Plains Marketing Canada, L.P. At the terminal, propane and butane are received via railcar and stored in pressure tanks or underground storage caverns. Propane and butane are loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only. Propane and butane are the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Alto Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal; however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nThere are two separate processes at the facility. Process Number 1 is the plant facility, including all pressure tanks and underground storage equipment at the site. The underground storage capacity of the site is over 200,000 000 pounds, but this quantity is not involved in the worst case release scenario at the facility since the storage is underground. Process Number 2 is the railcar unloading operation, whic"

These high standards include:\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible. \n\n?    Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the terminal.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Alto Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Plains purchased the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane or butane release has occurred at the Alto Terminal since Plains purchased the terminal or was reported under previous ownership and operation within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Alto Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Kent County Sheriff's Office, Michigan State Policy, County Emergency Services and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to "

The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the terminal include:\n\n?    Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n\n?    An ongoing dialogue with the Alto Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\n"
