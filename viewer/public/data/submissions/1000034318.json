Trained personnel are stationed at the tank wagon unloading area during all tank wagon unloadings.\n\n2. Each chemical has a specific procedure for unloading, with all necessary precautions and safety steps specified.\n\n3. Epichlorohydrin tank has a high level alarm with pump interlock and a high-high level alarm.\n\n4. Ethylenediamine has high and high-high level alarms.\n\n5. Computer inventory control to maintain tank levels always below maximum capacity.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental releases that occur at our facility. The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases invloving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past 5 years:\n\n\n\nChemical released - ethylenediamine\n\nEstimated duration - 2 minutes, 2 to 3 pounds spilled within containment dike.\n\nNJ DEP Case # assigned - 130129133348, phone # 877-927-6337 reported Tue. 1/29/13.\n\n\n\nSunday 1/27/2013 - Operator was splashed with some drops of ethylenediamine while disconnecting a nitrogen hose from pipeline (after clearing frozen material from transfer pipeline using nitrogen pressure). Cause of incident was operator error, in that the small vlave where the nitrogen connection was made was left open when the hose was disconnected, leading to the release.\n\n\n\nOperator washed off liquid suing emergency shower.

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency responders; the Newark Fire Dept., Hazmat team, NJDEP, and local medical emergency teams.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCardolite calculated likelihood rates in 2011 for identified scenarios with off-site impact involving epichlorohydrin and ethylenediamine and there are 3 sceanrios with likelihood rates greater than 10 to minus 6. An evaluation of risk reduction measures was made by Cardolite and in the case of one scenario, a transfer hose for unloading epichlorohydrin tankwagons will be changed out more frequently in order to reduce the likelihood rate.  There are no other improvents presently planned.\n\n\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\n\n\n\nWithin the past 5 years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impact provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). Additional measures have been taken to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases, as described in above section \"Planned Changes To Improve Safety\".
