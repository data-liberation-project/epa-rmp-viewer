This commitment to safety is exercised daily.  Personnel from every department take active roles in quality assurance, accident prevention, training and community involvement.  To this end, the facility maintains a standing Safety Committee that meets regularly to address safety concerns and formulate solutions.\n\nOak Farms is also involved in an ongoing effort to comply with regulations at the local, state and federal levels that require accident prevention, planning, training, and response.  This informational brochure has been prepared to address some of these requirements.\n\nApplicable Regulations\nThe Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan at Oak Farms Dairy comply with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention: Risk Management Plan.\n\nFacility Location and Regulated Substances\nThe Oak Farms Dairy facility located at 3417 Leeland, Houston,Texas is equipped with a refrigeration system that contains anhydrous ammonia (C.A.S. #7664-41-7). Ammonia is the sole regulated substance in regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccident Release Prevention\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Scenarios\nComputer air models were constructed ba"

      "SummaryText": "sed on a worst case release scenario, which would involve the catastrophic structural failure of the system receiver.  The receiver contains the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at the facility.  Results of the model indicate that the toxic endpoint in this scenario would extend to a distance of .6 miles from the release site. The likely alternate scenario in which pressure relief valves are activated resulted in a toxic endpoint of .1 miles.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe facility has experienced one (1) release in the past 5 years.  An evacuation occurred and the amount released was less than 100 pounds of ammonia. Other releases that are Incidental may occur during rountine engineering activities.  \n\nEmergency Response Program and Policies\nWritten emergency procedures are maintained at the facility.  All employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  Oak Farms has an agreement with a third party response contractor to be notified in the event of an uncontrolled release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the ongoing inspection and testing program, and regular replacement of deteriorated system components.  In all cases, improved process technology is employed where feasible.  Employees levels of awareness is enhanced by regular training programs and exercises."
