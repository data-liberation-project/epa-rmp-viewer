Occidental Chemical Corporation's Ingleside Plant is an integral part of the OxyChem commitment to the industrial chemicals market. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Ingleside Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances and emergency response programs. OxyChem is focusing on individual employee responsibilities for working safely and achieving the targets of zero safety and environmental incidents.  This program includes training of all employees on the basic values and beliefs that all accidents and chemical releases are preventable and it is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that they are aware of the goals of zero incidents and will be held accountable for their actions.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \nThe Ingleside Plant located on Highway 361 near Corpus Christi, Texas, produces important commodity chemicals such as chlorine, caustic soda, ethylene dichloride (EDC), and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  The VCM Plant is a joint venture between OxyMar and OxyVinyls entities. The OxyMar portion of the VCM Plant is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical and OxyVinyl.  The OxyVinyls portion is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical and Geon Corporation. OxyChem also operates a CoGeneration plant, which is a joint venture with Conoco Global Power, Inc.

This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC), also referred to as the Technical/Engineering Assistance Request (TEAR) program, and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.  The equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  OxyChem also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes. In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOn December 8, 2003, 114 pounds of liquid Chlorine was released from the Chlorine Accumulator.  Six on site chlorine inhalation first aid cases resulted from the release.  A half inch tubing valve that was replaced earier that day reacted with the liquid chlorine , resulting in a failure of the valve body.  The valve was found to have a titanium body, which is incompatable with dry chlorine.
