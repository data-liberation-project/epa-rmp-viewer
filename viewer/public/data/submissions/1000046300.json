The property surrounding the Jeffrey Energy Center is rural. \n\n\n\nAmmonia System Description\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage tanks are filled by a tanker truck at a dedicated loading station.  For the NOx control systems, liquid ammonia from the storage tanks is forwarded to a vaporizer skid, regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the Unit 1 flue within the ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the selective catalytic reduction unit, nitrogen oxides are reacted and emissions of the pollutant are reduced.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\n\n\nAn initial Process Hazard Assessment was performed using a 'What If/Checklist' type analysis for the Unit #1 ammonia system.  This analysis utilized a brainstorming approach, in which a team of people familiar with the process asks questions about possible undesirable events.  The What If analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction.  Checklists were completed to cover Facility Siting and Human Factors scenarios.  Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nPrevention System\n\n\n\nThe Jeffrey Energy Center has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each majo"

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia storage systems are in place. The SOPs will be written and available in appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns as well as emergency procedures. \n\n\n\nAmmonia sensors and alarms are in place to detect an ammonia release.  A fogging system is in place to mitigate the impact of an anhydrous ammonia release. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nJeffrey Energy Center (JEC) will respond to ammonia-related emergencies as a responding facility at the First Responder Operations level when a full team of release response personnel, as detailed in the site Emergency Response Plan, is on duty and ready to respond.  The Incident Commander in the event of an ammonia release must be trained in the Incident Command structure and be trained to the HazMat operations level.  In the event of an ammonia release where personnel rescue is required, JEC Fire Brigade members will function at the First Responder Operations level by isolating or stopping the leak without exposing personnel to hazardous levels of ammonia.  If no personnel are trapped in the hot zone of the ammonia release, the response will involve evacuating personnel from the path of the ammonia release and allowing the ammonia to dissipate.\n\n\n\nIf an ammonia release occurs at a time when a full team of response personnel is not on duty and there are personnel in the immediate area of the release, the Operations Supervisor will call 911 notifying the appropriate local emergency response organizations per Section 5.1. The Operations Supervisor will call out additional JEC Fire Brigade personnel. During this time, on duty response personnel can set up equipment outside of the hot zone and prepare for a response, but they cannot "
