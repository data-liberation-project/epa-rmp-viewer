Box 208\nOrd, NE\n68665\n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention\nof any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the\nevent an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company,\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to\npeople and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422910, \"Farm Supplies Wholesalers,\nhowever we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that includes the receiving, storage,\nand reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area,  The NAICS code we\nfeel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading is # 493130 \"Farm product warehousing\nand storage\".\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored during the off season at this facility.  There is no transfer of Anhyrous Ammonia that takes place at this facility. The Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility is used for direct application to farm fields.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the parking and\npicking up of tanks for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero. \n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our\nlargest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity\nas limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) miles\nbased on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (ver 1.06),  as well as possible public and environment"

Transfer hoses\nare protected by manual and self closing excess flow, valves  so our alternative release scenario is\nbased on the loss of contents from the largest hose used \nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is rounded to 0.1 mile per\ninstructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the\nAmerican National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA)  standard 29CRF 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\nAmmonia\".  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and\ndistribution of Anhydrus Ammonia. We also maintain routine contact with our\nlocal fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated\nin safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed and Emergency Action\nPlan for employees, customers, and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and\nother acts of God that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc,\nfor all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.

Our written employee safety programs include\npre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are\noffered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to insure\nthey conform to the community plan(s).  We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous\nAmmonia training programs by the local fire department, local emergency response team,\ncommunity planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe condition.  There are no additional specific\nrecommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nFor additional information, response to question, or comment, please contact:"
