      "SummaryText": "Productos Avicolas del Caribe, Inc. is a industry dedicated to the poultry meat processing.  The plant use ammonia liquefied under pressure for its refrigeration system. The facility as well as equipments, including the refrigeration one, are brand new and modern.\n\nThe refrigeration system is composed of high and low pressure receivers, rotary screw compressors, condensers, accumulators, air purges, evaporators, pumps, piping, valves and instruments. These equipments are located in the interior of the machine room. This room is partially enclosed and separated from the others buildings of the plant.  The room is equipped with ammonia leak detectors and alarm system.  The compressors units are controlled by a computer based machine control.  The controller continuously monitors the conditions and operation of the compressors units and the various subsystems. It also directs the operation of components. The control panel allow an operator to efficiently access and control the compressors and subsystems through a graphic screens. The control panel has remote monitoring capability, therefore the system can be monitoring from a computer uotside of the plant premises.  \n\nTechnical personnel including mechanical enginners and refrigeration systems specialists were carried out the installation and startup.  Up to day, any significant release of ammonia has occurred during the startup.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia carry out in the whole system is 14,650 pounds. Due the system is a close loop, not more ammonia need to be added.  The high pressure receiver is the vessel with the largest amount of ammonia with 3,150 pound.  \n\nModels, guidelines and recommendations from the Science Application International Corporations, the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration and OSHA were used for the safety program and RMP.  \n\nThe facility of Productos Avicolas is located in a remote rural area, out of public receptors like schools, offices, industrial areas and parks.
