The starch production area uses propylene oxide which is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Propylene oxide is stored in a 29,835-gallon capacity tank (rated capacity) which is hard-piped into the process area starch reactors.  The starch modification process uses propylene oxide as a reactant to generate water soluble starch products.  The maximum storage capacity of the tank is 85% of the rated capacity which equates to approximately 25,360 gallons or 175,545 pounds.\n\n2.3    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [A?68.155(c)]\nThe Cargill Hammond plant complies with all OSHA requirements as part of its safety program such as Hazard Communication 29 CFR 1910.1200 as well as other applicable requirements under 29 CFR 1910.  Other technical and procedural elements and practices that are utilized as part of the facility's accidental release prevention program include:\nA?    Security - limited access\nA?
