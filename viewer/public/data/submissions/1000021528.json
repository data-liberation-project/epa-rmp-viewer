The starch production area uses propylene oxide which is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Propylene oxide is stored in a 29,835-gallon capacity tank (rated capacity) which is hard-piped into the process area starch reactors.  The starch modification process uses propylene oxide as a reactant to generate water soluble starch products.  The maximum storage capacity of the tank is 85% of the rated capacity which equates to approximately 25,360 gallons or 175,545 pounds.\n\n2.3    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [A?68.155(c)]\nThe Cargill Hammond plant complies with all OSHA requirements as part of its safety program such as Hazard Communication 29 CFR 1910.1200 as well as other applicable requirements under 29 CFR 1910.  Other technical and procedural elements and practices that are utilized as part of the facility's accidental release prevention program include:\nA?    Security - limited access\nA?    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nA?    Operating procedures and safe work practice procedures\nA?    Mechanical integrity practices\nA?    Comprehensive training\nA?

The EAP details emergency notification and alert procedures.\n\n2.6    Planned Changes to Improve Safety [A?68.155(f)]\nCargill Hammond's safety program is ongoing and incorporates continuous improvement through internally required evaluations of safety actions and programs.  The plant will continue to explore chemical substitution, process modifications and additional safety equipment that can reduce the risk for on and off site impact of potential releases.\n\n3.0    RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PROGRAM 3 [40 CFR 68, SUBPART D]\nThe following elements of the RMP are also detailed in the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\n3.1    Process Safety Information [A?68.65]\nCargill Hammond's PSM program maintains technical documents that are used to assist in accident prevention efforts.  Written safety information includes chemical properties, process descriptions and diagrams, equipment design information, and operational parameters.\n\n3.2    Process Hazard Analysis [A?68.67]\nAs part of the PSM program, Cargill Hammond conducts process hazard analyses to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and abated effectively.  The Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique is primarily used.  A team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, safety and maintenance participates in the analysis.  The team findings are presented to management for resolution as needed.  Implementation of mitigation actions is based on a relative risk ranking system completed by the team.  Team findings are tracked until they are completed and appropriately documented. The HAZO"
