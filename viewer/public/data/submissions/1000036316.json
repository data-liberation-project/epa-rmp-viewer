Facility Information\n\n              The primary activity in the spring at the Crstline Branch is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n              Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n            \n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n                The facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\n                 a. There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\n                  The facility has:\n\n                  a. a written emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n                  b. Provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCAR).\n\n                  c.
