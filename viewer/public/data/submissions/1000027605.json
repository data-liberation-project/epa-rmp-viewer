The DEC uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safe operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nDEC's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.

The site is located in the city limits of Pittsburg in Contra Costa County at the border of the City of Antioch, and is approximately 35 miles northeast of San Francisco. \r\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 15,000-gallon double walled steel storage tank at 85% capacity, which is located inside a secondary containment area.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at DEC to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the three  Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Anhydrous ammonia  vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the three Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions. \r\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at DEC exceeds the federal RMP (and PSM) and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP, PSM and CalARP regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nManagement System\r\nRisk Management Program regulations require those facilities with processes subject to Program 3 to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.

This information includes ammonia background information, material safety data sheets (MSDS), and ammonia reaction chemistry.\r\nEquipment safety information has been compiled on the ammonia process, and specifications for the process are compiled in one place for easy reference 24 hours a day.  Details such as maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower operating temperatures and pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  Calpine Corporation verifies that that equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices by specifying that the latest codes and standards be used for the design of the plant, conducting a seismic assessment to confirm that the process meets structural codes, and by reviewing the ammonia process in the process hazard analysis.  Calpine also has scheduled reviews of the risk management program to update safety information if there is a major change that would make existing information inaccurate.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nEvaluation of new equipment and processes has and will continue to be implemented in an effort to protect employees, the public, and the surrounding environment. The HAZOP was conducted on 12/7/2005 and revalidated on 12/16/2010. After reviewing the process safety information, the PHA team used a P&ID, dividing the ammonia process into five nodes that were used to systematically identify causes of potential anhydrous ammonia releases. \r\nThe PHA team brainstormed recommendations to reduce the risk of accidental anhydrous ammonia releases for each significant release scenario.
