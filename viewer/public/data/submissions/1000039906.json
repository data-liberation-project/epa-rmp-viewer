This  Risk\r\nManagement  Plan summarizes the efforts that this company  has\r\nundertaken to establish a Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only chemical used at the AES  Hawaii\r\nfacility  that is above the RMP threshold amount.  The  onsite\r\nmaximum storage quantity of the liquid anhydrous ammonia  tank\r\nat  the AES Hawaii plant is 109,000 pounds, which is above the\r\n10,000 pound RMP applicability threshold. The AES Hawaii plant\r\ndoes  not  use  any other chemicals or flammable materials  in\r\nexcess of threshold quantities covered by RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nA  management  system  will be in place  at  the  facility  to\r\noversee  implementation  of  the  facility's  Risk  Management\r\nProgram. This management system is considered one of the  most\r\nimportant elements of this facility's Risk Management Program,\r\nas  its  goal  is  to  ensure  that  lines  of  authority  and\r\nresponsibility are clearly defined, helping to ensure that all\r\nelements  of  the Risk Management Program are implemented.  At\r\nthe  AES  Hawaii  Facility, the person  who  has  the  overall\r\nresponsibility  for  the  Risk  Management  Program   is   the\r\nenvironmental coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe   facility   also   participates  in  emergency   response\r\nactivities  with the Campbell Local Emergency  Action  Network\r\n(CLEAN). CLEAN has developed an Emergency Management Plan that\r\nprovides  supplemental guidance and information  to  emergency\r\nresponse personnel, local residents, and business based on the\r\nspecific  operations  in and around Campbell  Industrial  Park\r\n(CIP).

The  Plant  is  located  near\r\nBarber's  Point, within the area known as Campbell  Industrial\r\nPark,  which is on the Island of Oahu about 30 miles  west  of\r\nHonolulu. Electricity generated by the facility is supplied to\r\nHawaiian  Electric Company, and steam is sold  to  the  nearby\r\nChevron USA oil refinery. The plant has two Circulating  Fluid\r\nBed  (CFB) coal-fired boilers and one steam turbine.  The  CFB\r\nboilers  use a clean coal technology that minimizes  emissions\r\nof  sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides. The boilers use limestone\r\nthat  reacts  with  the sulfur in the coal  to  reduce  sulfur\r\ndioxide  emissions. The nitrogen oxides emissions are  reduced\r\nby   two   factors:   the  relatively  low  boiler   operating\r\ntemperatures  and  the addition of anhydrous  ammonia  to  the\r\nboiler  flue  gas  that  reacts with the  nitrogen  oxides  to\r\nproduce harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.\r\n\r\nAmmonia safety considerations have been incorporated into  the\r\nconstruction  of  the  ammonia system.  The  ammonia  tank  is\r\nsecured  to the ground and has cathodic protection.  The  tank\r\nhas   relief   valves   at  the  top  of   the   tank.   Thus,\r\noverpressurization  of  the tank would primarily  involve  the\r\nventing of gas in the upper part of the tank. The vapor  lines\r\nfrom  the  tank  to  the  boiler area  are  buried  to  reduce\r\npotential  releases  from this piping. Loading  and  unloading\r\nvalves,  the tank, and tanker truck are equipped with automatic\r\nshut-off  valves  in  the event that flow through  the  valves\r\nexceeds  design criteria. Therefore, in the event of a loading\r\nhose  failure,  the  flow  of ammonia would  be  automatically\r\nterminated.  The facility also has monitors  located  in  the\r\nammonia system process area that detect leaks and triggers an\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nThis  facility maintains a Prevention Progr"

In\r\naccordance  with  this  program,  the  ammonia  processes  and\r\nequipment  must be constructed, installed, and  maintained  in\r\norder to minimize the risk of releases of the highly hazardous\r\nchemicals.  The  mechanical integrity program  at  AES  Hawaii\r\nincludes  identifying  and categorizing equipment.  Inspecting\r\nand  testing  of  instrumentation and documenting  maintenance\r\nprocedures;  training  of maintenance personnel;  establishing\r\ncriteria  for  acceptable test results; documenting  test  and\r\ninspection  results; and documenting manufacturer  information\r\nfor equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe  facility  performs a system integrity  check  every  five\r\nyears   for  the  ammonia  storage  tank  and  all  associated\r\nhoses/lines.   The  most  recent  vessel inspection was completed\r\nin 2009.  In addition, all emergency  relief  and excess flow\r\nvalves, storage  tank  isolation valves, flexible connections,\r\nand hoses are scheduled for replacement in 2014. The equipment\r\nis maintained in accordance  with manufacturer specifications,\r\nand  applicable ANSI,   and  ASME  engineering  codes.  A  \r\ncomputer   database generates work orders to identify when such\r\nmaintenance  needs to  be  implemented.  Once,  each  6-hour \r\nperiod,  operators visually   observe  the  equipment  for  signs\r\nof   potential malfunction.  Alarms and interlocks are checked \r\non  a"

      "SummaryText": "monthly basis.\r\n\r\nAll  new employees, regardless of position, are given a safety\r\nwalk  of  all areas of AES Hawaii. This walk through  includes\r\nthe  ammonia system. Special emphasis is placed on the  nature\r\nof  the anhydrous ammonia and actions of all personnel in case\r\nof  an ammonia problem (i.e. leak). All persons hired who  are\r\nresponsible  for  operations of the ammonia system  are  given\r\nfull  classroom training before they are allowed to  work  on,\r\noperate, or otherwise manipulate or affect the ammonia system.\r\nThe  classroom  course includes detailed  instruction  on  the\r\nammonia  system,  including the physical aspects  of  ammonia,\r\noperating  the  ammonia system, and casualties  involving  the\r\nammonia  system.  They are trained regarding the  hazards  and\r\nsafety  precautions to be observed for the ammonia system.  In\r\naddition, annual refresher training is required.\r\n\r\nThe  plant  has a current \"Disaster and Emergency  Plan\".  All\r\nemployees  have  been trained in the plan,  and  the  plan  is\r\nreviewed  frequently to verify that it is current  with  plant\r\noperating  practice.  The  plan  contains  emergency  response\r\nprocedures  (ERP)  which include actions  for  evaluating  the\r\nseverity  and  controlling  releases  of  hazardous  materials\r\nincluding  ammonia.  A  list  of the  agencies  that  must  be\r\nnotified is included in the plan to assure that the public  is\r\nproperly notified in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAES  Hawaii  has  performed a Hazard and  Operability  (HAZOP)\r\nAnalysis  that  evaluated  all  potential  hazards   for   the\r\nfacility.  The  HAZOP  study was performed  according  to  the\r\nprocedures  described  in \"Guidelines  for  Hazard  Evaluation\r\nProcedures;  Center for Chemical Process Safety\" published  by\r\nthe  American Institute of Chemical Engineers, New  York.  The\r\nHAZOP  was  performed by a team of technical  experts  in  the\r\nsystem's process, engineering, design, operations maintenance,\r\nand  safety.  The amm"

      "SummaryText": "onia system was divided into sections  or\r\nsegments  and assigned a node number. Each node was  evaluated\r\nfor  deviations  using guide words such as  \"no  flow\",  \"high\r\npressure\",  etc.  The cause and consequence of  a  guide  word\r\napplied  to  a  node were evaluated to determine and  identify\r\ndeviations and/or hazards that can result from application  of\r\na  guide  word  to  the node. Each identified consequence  was\r\nassigned  a  relative risk rank based on the severity  of  the\r\nconsequence and anticipated frequency. The team then discussed\r\ncorrective actions which were recorded and implemented or  are\r\nin the process of being implemented.\r\n\r\nAES Hawaii performs on site Ammonia Release Scenario Drills at\r\nleast once per year.   Response team members who are qualified \r\nto  respond  to  Anhydrous Ammonia releases,  walk  through  a\r\npotential uncontrolled release scenario to determine potential\r\ngaps  in   emergency  preparedness.     These  gaps  are  then\r\nincorporated  into  future  emergency  preparedness   training \r\nsessions.\r\n\r\nAES  has  implemented  these  various  analyses  and  training\r\nprograms  to prevent and prepare for an emergency release.  To\r\ndate, this facility's Five Year History (and entire history of\r\nthe  plant) includes only one  accidental  releases  from  the\r\nammonia system which resulted in an injury to an employee. The\r\nrelease  was  quickly  isolated,  and  can  be  attributed  to\r\nthe inexperience of an operator trainee.    There have been no\r\nother  accidental releases which resulted in deaths,  injuries,\r\nor significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths,\r\ninjuries, evacuations,  sheltering  in-place,  property damage,\r\nor environmental damage."
