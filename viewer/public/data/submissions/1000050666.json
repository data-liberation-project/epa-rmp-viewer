(Agriform), Woodland Facility (Facility) at 40189 County Road 18C, Woodland, California, 95776 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in a 22,440-gallon storage tank (bullet). The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 98,040 pounds.
