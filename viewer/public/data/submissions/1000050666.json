(Agriform), Woodland Facility (Facility) at 40189 County Road 18C, Woodland, California, 95776 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in a 22,440-gallon storage tank (bullet). The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 98,040 pounds.  Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in a 75,000-gallon storage tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 548,625 pounds.    \n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for each of the regulated processes.  The results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n\n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\n\n\nSafety Information:  Agriform ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances is up-to-date and available for review by employees.

      "SummaryText": "information pertaining to the covered processes took place in May 2015.\n\n\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on June 29, 2015.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last reviewed in April 2015.\n\n\n\nTraining:  The Agriform Facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group, Inc. (Tremont) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed in May 2015.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n?    Initial employee training;\n\n?    Periodic refresher training;\n\n?    Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\n\n?    Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n\n?    Training records for each employee.\n\n\n\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted in March 2015 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in January 2015.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation "
