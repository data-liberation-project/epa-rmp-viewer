This update is the facility's mandatory five-year update as required in 40 CFR Part 68.190.\n\nAt General Chemical Newark Works, one RMP listed chemical (40 CFR 68.130) is managed on-site in quantity greater than the threshold quantity (as specified in 40 CFR 68.130) and is program level 3 based on the NAICS code for the facility (325188).  Oleum (20-27%) is produced on-site. No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria.\n\nThis RMP executive summary describes Newark Works' risk management program, which includes the following sections:\n\n* Section 1.0 - Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n* Section 2.0 - Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n* Section 3.0 - General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* Section 4.0 - Five Year Accident History\n* Section 5.0 - Emergency Response Program \n* Section 6.0 - Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGeneral Chemical LLC recognizes that the responsible management of health, safety and the environment in and around its facilities is one of its highest corporate priorities and a key element in its successful business strategy.  General Chemical LLC is committed to implementing policies and procedures which confirm that its operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Achieving responsible health, safety and environmental management will be accomplished by: operating our facilities safely and prudently; efficiently using energy and materials; seeking ways to minimize or reuse wastes; "

Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Newark Works has prepared employees in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release.\n\n2.0    Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nGeneral Chemical's Newark Works produces Oleum for use in local and national markets. The chemical is used in many applications including water treatment, papermaking, detergents, batteries, nylon and computer chips.  Oleum is transferred off-site via tank truck and tank car.  \n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and foster safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Newark Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\n* Standard Operating Procedures - Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\n* Employee Participation - Employees at all levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.  \n\n* Training - Employees in the operating process are train"
