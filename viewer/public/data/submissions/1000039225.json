      "SummaryText": "At Wako Chemicals USA, Inc. safety is the responsibility of each employee.  The plant staff is trained in the hazards and emergency response requirements for the chemicals used in the processes.  New employees are trained in safety practices and emergency procedures prior to entering the plant to work.  Annual training in these areas along with response drills help keep employees knowledgeable of the hazards in the facility.  This manufacturing process has been in operation since 1990.\n\n\n\nWako is an ISO 9001 certified chemical manufacturing site for specialty chemicals.  Besides manufacturing, we also import packaged chemicals for sale to our customers in the United States and abroad.   These chemicals are properly stored in our warehouses maintaining proper inventory levels to meet our customers' needs.  One chemical, anhydrous hydrogen chloride (AHCl)used in manufacturing requires Wako to have this Risk Management Plan.  AHCl is a liquid stored under pressure.  Wako removes vaporized AHCl through small pipes from containers for use in our manufacturing process.  Control valves reduce the line pressure before it is sent to the process.  Over pressuring is prevented by the control valves, rupture discs, relief valves, excess flow valves, and by close observation from plant employees. Only one container is used at a time to deliver AHCl vapor to the process.  This helps minimize the potential danger for releases that could harm plant personnel, the environment, and affect the off-site public.  In 2003 there was an improvement to the method of measuring the amount of AHCl used in the manufacturing process.  This change allowed safer operation using AHCl vapor rather than liquid from the containers. \n\n\n\nOur facility minimizes the risk of chemical release through procedures, practices, and equipment maintenance.  The AHCl is kept in closed containers and only used during monitored operations.  The equipment is inspected routinely and transfer hoses replaced on a regular"

      "SummaryText": " basis.  We regularly test area AHCl detector that activates a fire system sprinkler deluge over the containers and delivery system.  Operating procedures require safe operation and close observation of the equipment to avoid leaks.  The facility operates under OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations that require operational hazards to be evaluated, management of change, strict safety procedures, emergency response planning, etc.  Wako is a member of the Virginia OSH \"SHARP\" Program that requires routine audits by Virginia OSH Department and an active safety program. \n\n  \n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years involving AHCl that required notification to regulatory agencies or the public.  Plant management and the chemical supply company work together for training and process safety.\n\n \n\nOperating the equipment related to the AHCl process is done by plant supervisors and \"senior operators\" only.  These experienced chemical handlers have been trained in the operating procedures, emergency procedures, and understand the nature and hazards of the chemical.  The chemical supplier regularly provides training for our site personnel, and drills are conducted to review emergency procedures.  Wako works with Chesterfield County Fire Department and the County Emergency Planning Committee to drill and understand the on-site chemicals including AHCl. The County Fire Department would be called to respond to AHCl releases that activate the area monitoring sensor and water deluge system.  \n\n\n\nWako will continue to operate the AHCl equipment in a responsible manner and evaluate any operating or equipment changes that may be required as conditions change.
