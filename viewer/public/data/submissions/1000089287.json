Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Wonderful Citrus D2 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Wonderful Citrus D2, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Wonderful Citrus D2 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical           | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nConditioning             Anhydrous Ammonia            30,000\n\nStorage                  Anhydrous Ammonia             9,800\n\nProcess 3                Anhydrous Ammonia            53,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. \n\n\n\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promot"

The facility has three (3) ammonia systems which are named Conditioning, Cold Storage, and Process 3 respectively. \n\n\n\nThe systems provide refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\nConditioning System\n\n?    (44) Degreening rooms\n\n?    (4) Whip rooms\n\nCold Storage System\n\n?    (2) Cold storage rooms\n\n?    (1) Precool room\n\n?    (1) Loading dock\n\nProcess 3 \n\n?    (80) Conditioning rooms\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces in the Conditioning and Cold Storage systems are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation while Process 3 is equipped with air-cooling evaporators and a pump recirculator as required for pumped overfeed operation. All control valve groups are mounted on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within the three (3) refrigeration machinery rooms or directly outside near the machinery rooms. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nConditioning System\n\n?    (1) 72\" Dia x 30'-0\" Long High Pressure Receiver\n\n?    (1) 24\" Dia x 4'-0\" Long Liquid Transfer Vessel\n\n?

From the accumulator, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulators. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator. From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nProcess 3 operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Wonderful Citrus D2 facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 93,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admini"

As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 was built in 2012 by Ross & Sons. The original construction included the Process 1 and Process 2. In 2015, American Incorporated was hired to design and install the refrigeration equipment for Process 3.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tanks if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north exterior wall of the Process 1 and Process 2 machinery rooms, which contain three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system. Process 3 is equipped with an emergency pressure control system which will automatically equalize pressure in the system prior to a relief valve lifting.\n\n\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Wonderful Citrus D2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping, but are not connected to each other. As such, each refrigeration system at Wonderful Citrus D2 is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged i"

Nevertheless, Wonderful Citrus D2 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Wonderful Citrus D2's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Wonderful Citrus D2's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus D2 has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.
