From the accumulator, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulators. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator. From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nProcess 3 operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nWonderful Citrus D2 was built in 2012 by Ross & Sons. The original construction included the Process 1 and Process 2. In 2015, American Incorporated was hired to design and install the refrigeration equipment for Process 3.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tanks if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north exterior wall of the Process 1 and Process 2 machinery rooms, which contain three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system. Process 3 is equipped with an emergency pressure control system which will automatically equalize pressure in the system prior to a relief valve lifting.\r\n\r\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Wonderful Citrus D2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping, but are not connected to each other.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\nWonderful Citrus D2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Wonderful Citrus D2 facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.

Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.
