The facility supplies potable water to the Town of \nTonawanda, and the village of Kenmore. In order to disenfect the drinking water, gaseous chlorine is utilized.\nThis type of system is commonly used at most water treatment plants. The facility has a maximum capacity of \n16 one-ton cylinders (32,000 pounds) although, at most 8,000 pounds of chlorine are connected to the process                           (four one-ton cylinders). Following are the required seven elements for Water Treatment Plant.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies-\nThe Water Treatment Plant Complies with all Federal, State and Local requirements for chlorine processes.\nThe facility was designed and constructed in accourdance with applicable industry standards and codes. In an\nemergency the facility will call 911 and the local volunteer fire department will respond. The facility has a \nwritten set of emergency response procedures that describes who to call under what conditions.\n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled-\nThe facility is a potable water treatment plant. The facility has 32,000 pounds of chlorine on-hand at any one time.\n\nWorst case release scenario and alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation\nmeasures to limit the distance for each reported scenario-\nThe worst case release scenerio is a rupture of a one-ton cylinder which is the largestvessel in the system. A\nrelease from the cylinder woul include 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The release would be a liquid spilled onto the\nfloor in the chlorine room. The cylinder room doors and windows are kept closedwhich will help mitigate the release.\nThe liquid will vaporize from a vapor cloud. The cloud will be released from the buildingeither via leakage, or by \nexhaust from the building, over a period of time, by the"

The alternate \nscenario would consist of a relaese from a broken cylinder pigtail that connects the chlorine to the process. \nThe relief would be into the cylinder storage room. For both the worst case and alternate releases scenarios, \nchlorine detectors are in place that will detect the release and notify the treatment plant operator, which is on-duty\n24 hours per day, seven days per week. The operator will in turn will follow written procedures for notification of\nemergency personnel.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\nThe facility complies with EPA's Risk Management Program requirements and all applicable state local codes \nand standards in effect at the time the facility was constructed. \n\nFive year accident history-\nThere have been not any releases from this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency response program-\nIn the event of an emergency the facility will call 911 and request that the local fire department/hazmat team \nrespond to the emergency. Several members of the Town of Tonawanda Water Plant have appropriate training on\nthe use of personal protective equipment and may assist the fire department with resque, isolation, and shut-off of\nthe release. Written emergency response procedures are provided in the facility's Emergency response Plan. The \nlocal fire department has trained at the facility and will in the future attend drills at the facility.\n\n\n"
