The facility supplies potable water to the Town of \nTonawanda, and the village of Kenmore. In order to disenfect the drinking water, gaseous chlorine is utilized.\nThis type of system is commonly used at most water treatment plants. The facility has a maximum capacity of \n16 one-ton cylinders (32,000 pounds) although, at most 8,000 pounds of chlorine are connected to the process                           (four one-ton cylinders).

In an\nemergency the facility will call 911 and the local volunteer fire department will respond. The facility has a \nwritten set of emergency response procedures that describes who to call under what conditions.\n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled-\nThe facility is a potable water treatment plant. The facility has 32,000 pounds of chlorine on-hand at any one time.\n\nWorst case release scenario and alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation\nmeasures to limit the distance for each reported scenario-\nThe worst case release scenerio is a rupture of a one-ton cylinder which is the largestvessel in the system. A\nrelease from the cylinder woul include 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The release would be a liquid spilled onto the\nfloor in the chlorine room.

Several members of the Town of Tonawanda Water Plant have appropriate training on\nthe use of personal protective equipment and may assist the fire department with resque, isolation, and shut-off of\nthe release.
