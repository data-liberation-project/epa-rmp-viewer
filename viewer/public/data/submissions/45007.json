      "SummaryText": "The industry Alberto Culver (PR) Inc is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. It is their policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances. The industry's primary activities are Health and Beauty products. The regulated process invloves the manufacture of hair mousses and feminine deodorant spray. Isobutane and Dymel are used as dispersants for the products.\n\nThe industry has two regulated substances, both flammables: A-31 Isobutane (Propane, 2 methyl) and Dymel (mixture of isobutane, propane and difluoroethane). They also have LPG cylinders. The regulated substances are flammables used in the process. The LPG is used to fuel a flare control system for the process. There are two storage tanks of 18,000 gallons each to store Isobutane and Dymel. Only one tank is used at a time for the process. A maximum of 6-239 lbs of LPG cylinders are stored in the facility, with one LPG cylinder in line with the flare's pilot flame.\n\nThe facility is subject to OSHA PSM and so it qualifies for Program 3 processes. It is also in compliance with OSHA PSM Rule. There is a 12,000 gallon ethanol tank used for sanitizing equipment after cleaning them. Although ethanol is not a regulated substance listed in 68.130, it was determined that both the storage and on-site movement is applicable to OSHA PSM because of the tank proximity to the covered process such that an incident in either storage tank could involve the other one. A PHA was required according to employer priority. And thus the RMP is being updated. Back-up systems were revised and updated, training was updated and management of change procedures were revised among other things. \n\nThere has not been any accidental release in the last five years provious to the submission of this RMP that has resulted in serious onsite or offsite impacts.\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which was updated and fully implemented. Changes planned for the near future"
