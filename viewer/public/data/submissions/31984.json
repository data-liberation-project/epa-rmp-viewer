      "SummaryText": "Orientation and General Overview:\nThe City of Biloxi has twenty three (23) water well sites that are utilized to produce drinking water for the citizens and businesses of the City. Fifteen (15) of these water wells have two (2) cylinders each of liquid chlorine, each of which contains 2,000 pounds, for a total of 4,000 pounds of liquid chlorine at each well site. This RMP is for one of those fifteen (15) water well sites.\n\nThe City of Biloxi  operates and maintains the City's water production and distribution system, and its wastewater collection system. The City owns the utility facilities and is therefore responsible for the submission of this RMP.\n\n\nNature of Facility Risk Imposed and Risk Minimization:\nThe primary facility risk to the public is that liquid chlorine could be released into the atmosphere as a toxic gas (a vapor). A total rupture of the chlorine cylinders or a total failure of the process equipment is highly unlikely; therefore a sudden and total release of all of the chlorine is also highly unlikely. The more likely scenario is the slow release of chlorine due to a leak of some type. Although great measures have been taken to prevent such leak event, such leak would result in the dispersal of chlorine gas to about .1 mile from the facility, according to the RMP*Comp Model, Version 1.06. To minimize this risk, numerous steps and measures have been taken and documented throughout this Executive Summary and the RMP. A specific example not noted in the RMP is the change-out of the chlorination system from pressure regulators to vacuum regulators, which is a far safer and more reliable system.\n\n\nRMP*Submit  - Data Entry Explanations:\nSection 1.11 asks the question \"Number of full time employees on site\". The described facility is inspected every single day of the year by a city employee that holds a current and valid Waterworks Operator Certification as promulgated by the State of Mississippi Department of Health. Each daily inspection generally takes"

The EPA hotline attendant for the RMP program suggested that a \"1\" be entered in this data field and then explained with an entry in the Executive Summary, which this paragraph accomplishes.\n\n\nBelow are summaries of selected elements of the RMP, as specifically requested in the RMP User's Manuals, Pages 2.1 through 2.2:\n\nAccidental Release and Prevention Emergency Response Policies:\nAt this facility, chlorine is handled, which is considered by the EPA to be a hazardous material. The same qualities that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of persons working with and around the chlorine, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. \n\nIt is the policy of  the City  to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which the chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies were modeled from various professional sources, such as the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities, J. J. Keller and Associates, Inc.'s Keller-Soft Safety Plans, and OSHA documentation.\n\n\nFacility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nTwo (2) cylinders of liquid chlorine, containing 2,000 pounds each, are located at this facility, for a total of 4,000 pounds of liquid chlorine.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to distribute chlorine into the public water system in a safe and reliable manner that is in conformance with regulations as established by the Mississippi Department of Health, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.

The chlorine is provided by a licensed and certified vendor and is delivered in vehicles that are in conformance with Department of Transportation regulations.\n\nA chain link fence that allows visibility secures this facility. This fence is chained and locked. There is also another chain link fence immediately surrounding the chlorine cylinders. It is also chained and locked.

The site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors only.

Wait until the pump starts and the chlorine booster pump is running.\n\nSTEP 5:\tTurn the chlorine cylinder off.\n\nSTEP 6:\tCheck the rotameter to ensure that it drops to zero and stays there. If the rotameter does not drop to zero, perform maintenance as needed on the poly tubing to ensure that the rotameter drops to zero.\n\nSTEP 7:\tWith the well still running, slowly loosen the regulator.

If there is a leak, tighten the cap to stop the leak and notify dispatch to notify the vendor to retrieve the cylinder and leave a replacement cylinder. If there is no leak, then remove the cap. Then clean the face of the valve outlet.\n\nSTEP 9:\tRemove the lead washer from the yolk. Clean the area and always use a new washer!\n\nSTEP 10:\tPut the yolk over the cylinder and tighten it. Make sure that the nipple fits properly in the socket. Do not over-tighten the nipple.\n\nSTEP 11:\tOpen slowly the cylinder valve and check for a leak. If there is a leak, close the valve and slightly tighten the yolk assembly. Then slowly open the valve and check again for a leak. Repeat this procedure until there is no leak. If there still is a leak and this procedure does not stop it, then tighten the cap to stop the leak and notify dispatch to notify the vendor to retrieve the cylinder and leave a replacement.\n\nSTEP 12:\tTurn the well back to the automatic mode.\n\nSTEP 13:\tRecord in the daily logbook the date, time, personnel present and the maintenance performed.\n\nSTEP 14:\tCall dispatch to notify them that you have completed changing the cylinder.\n\n\nWorst -Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Total failure of either or both cylinders is highly unlikely.
