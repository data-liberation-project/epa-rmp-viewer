The Gibson Plant also includes an amine treatment system.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n\n\nThe Gibson Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor for the period of five (5) years prior to June 2013.  In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor.  Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the Facility and local emergency planning and response organizations.  Therefore, the Gibson Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\n\n\nThe Gibson Plant employs six (6) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P.

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane.  The maximum inventory of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 4,364 gallons (17,118 lbs).  \n\n\n\nGibson Plant representatives have reviewed all chemicals used and/or stored at the Facility and determined that there are no RMP regulated toxics present above RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nBecause the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68.
