The SIC code for the operattion is 2026; the NAICS code is 311511. The facility has approximetely 100 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The current capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe facility has never experienced a significant release incident. Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures. The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating,Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits and contractor qualifications. The PSM program is reviewed annually and u"

All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance to the PSM/RMP management of change provision in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance to the facility's PSM program. The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day. Walking inspections are conducted on intervals no longer than 8 hours. System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenace activities.\n\n\n\nThe system is equpped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected. The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room. The system shutdown can be manually operated using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia. The facility conducts periodic incident evacuation drills. The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or off-site evacuation or sheltering in place. Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\nLALA Branded Products Inc. has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.
