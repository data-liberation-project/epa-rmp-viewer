ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nINEOS takes its responsibility for the environment very seriously and is fully committed to delivering a record of responsible environmental performance across all operations.  INEOS continually strives to meet and where practicable exceed strict safety, health and environmental performance targets and is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations.  Excellence in safety, health and environmental performance is INEOS? top priority.  INEOS is open and honest about such performance, which is published locally and nationally, as required.\n\nINEOS operates to strict regulations that are set by the national environment agencies of the countries in which they operate.  INEOS is committed to ensuring that their facilities have as low an impact as possible on local people and the environment and continue to work in close partnership with community groups and other stakeholders to ensure that they are a responsible neighbor.\n\nINEOS? commitment is to protect the health and safety of our employees, the communities in which they operate and the users of their products.  INEOS aims to meet or where practicable exceed all relevant legislative requirements and minimize the effect of their operations on the environment.\n\nActive employee and contractor involvement is critical to achieving safety, health, and environmental objectives.  Employees and contractors throughout the Company participate in safety teams, contribute to investigations and incident learning, and suggest ongoing improvements in safety standards and procedures. \n\nINEOS commitment to safety starts at the top as a core value of the company.  It is driven through the Executive Boards of each of INEOS? 19 businesses, w"

INEOS supports a positive and open environment across their businesses, supported by effective communication between management, employees and contractors and an ongoing program of investment in safety.\n\nINEOS management teams and employees know that the sustainable long-term future of their businesses rests on their track record on safety, health and the environment.  INEOS views safety, health and the environment as the top priority of all INEOS companies.\n\n2.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility manufactures plastics and resins.  The plastic pellet products are sold to molders for end use in refrigerator and automobile interiors, medical uses, computer housings, health spas, tools, and much more. The resins are used to coat circuit boards and coat aluminum cans to allow printing on the can.\n\nTwo RMP chemicals are used in the facility, acrylonitrile and butadiene.  These make up two of the three main chemicals used to make the plastic products.  (The third being styrene a non-RMP chemical).  Acrylonitrile is a liquid and stored in two tanks prior to being used in smaller tanks and in several plastic manufacturing processes.  Butadiene is stored under pressure in a tank.  All storage tanks have concrete dike floors and walls capable of holding more than the quantity of the material being stored.  Multiple processes use these chemicals in various quantities in a process at one time.   Acrylonitrile is the only toxic RMP chemical and represents the worst case scenario for toxic chemicals.  Butadiene is the only flammable RMP chemical and thus represents the worst case flammable scenario.\n \n3A. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenario for acrylonitrile assumes the following:\n?    Greatest quantity of acrylonitrile is release from the largest storage tank over a 10 minute period.\n?    The release is into the concrete dike which reduces the"
