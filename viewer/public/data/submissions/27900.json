Helena's Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance is a fundamental part of every Helena Chemical Company employee's job.  Helena's spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If such a release does occur, Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Helena protects the safety of employees, the nearby community, and the environment.\n\n\n\n    1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at Helena's Sublette, Kansas Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to end users.  As defined in 40 CFR 68.3, a stationary source means any buildings, structures, equipment, installations, or substance-emitting stationary activities which belong to the same industrial group, which are located on one or more contiguous properties, from which an accidental release may occur.

Administrative controls are implemented to limit the maximum storage quantity of anhydrous ammonia to 85% of the 30,000 WG (equivalent to 25,500 water gallon (WG)) bulk storage vessel's total storage capacity.  The worst case release scenario (WCRS) is based on the worst-case release quantity of 140,166 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in a liquid/gaseous form over 10 minutes or worst-case release rate of 14,016 lbs. per minute.  Under worst case weather conditions, Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) windspeed, the estimated worst-case consequence distance based on the worst-case release rate and toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or 200 parts per million (ppm) is 6.9 miles.  This is the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint specified for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe ARS for anhydrous ammonia involves a release from a ruptured 1-inch transfer hose from the 30,000 W.G.

Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.  In addition, employees not operating the anhydrous ammonia process are involved in safety training on the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n        1.4.4    Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nHelena performs documented maintenance checks on anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer equipment to ensure proper functions.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nWhen outside contractors are required for maintenance and construction activities, those personnel are accompanied by Helena employees or are briefed by the area supervisor on the rules, regulations, and emergency procedures outlined in the Emergency Action Plan before initiating work.  Contractors use hot work permits, confined space permits, comply with lockout procedures, and use appropriate personal protective equipment when needed.  Contractors are briefed on the emergency alarm procedures and emergency rendezvous point.  Contractors must sign the visitor log.  The supervisor debriefs the contractor after each day.\n\n\n\n        1.4.5    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nHelena conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the RMP rule are being implemented.
