Helena's Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance is a fundamental part of every Helena Chemical Company employee's job.  Helena's spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If such a release does occur, Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Helena protects the safety of employees, the nearby community, and the environment.\r\n\r\n\t1.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at Helena's Sublette, Kansas Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to end users.  As defined in 40 CFR 68.3, a stationary source means any buildings, structures, equipment, installations, or substance-emitting stationary activities which belong to the same industrial group, which are located on one or more contiguous properties, from which an accidental release may occur.

Administrative controls are implemented to limit the maximum storage quantity of anhydrous ammonia to 85% of the 30,000 WG (equivalent to 25,500 water gallon (WG)) bulk storage vessel's total storage capacity.  The worst case release scenario (WCRS) is based on the worst-case release quantity of 140,166 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in a liquid/gaseous form over 10 minutes or worst-case release rate of 14,016 lbs. per minute.  Under worst case weather conditions, Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) windspeed, the estimated worst-case consequence distance based on the worst-case release rate and toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or 200 parts per million (ppm) is 6.9 miles.  This is the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint specified for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe ARS for anhydrous ammonia involves a release from a ruptured 1-inch transfer hose from the 30,000 W.G.

Administrative controls are implemented to limit the maximum storage quantity in the nurse tank to 85% of the nurse vessel's maximum storage capacity or approximately 4700 pounds.
