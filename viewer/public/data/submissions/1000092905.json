Due to the possibility of having public receptors in the area, a more feasible scenario must be calculated.  The alternative scenario involves ethylene being released at a rate of 2,000 pounds per minute due to a compromise in the ethylene system.  The distance it takes for the ethylene to reach the lower flammability limit is 1,056 feet (or 0.2 miles); which is expected to have no public receptors.\r\nThe scenarios described above do not consider many of the mitigating control measures presently in place for the applicable process storage areas.  Below is a list of mitigating control measures utilized at the PRC for applicable processes:\r\n\u00bf\tThe North Storage Tank Area is surrounded by hydrocarbon detectors that automatically detect the release of isobutane or ethylene and activate a remote and local alarm system.\r\n\u00bf\tThe area is equipped with a fixed water system that, in the event of a hydrocarbon release, operates automatically to disperse vapors.\r\n\u00bf\tTypical operations for ethylene tube trailers include:\r\no\tOpen one tube at a time as needed and not all at once, thus limiting the supply\r\no\twhen a full trailer is dropped off, another trailer is picked up and removed from site\r\no\tTube trailers are inspected and tested per DOT requirements\r\n\u00bf\tTypical operations for isobutane tank include:\r\no\tStandard Operating Procedures (SOP's) do not allow the isobutane tanks to be filled above 80% of capacity (18,000 gallons) to minimize risk.\r\no\tAll pressure relief valves are inspected bi-annually.\r\no\tThe tanks exteriors are inspected every five years and tanks internals are inspected every 10 years.\r\nThe PRC has not had any accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in t"

The chemicals are presently being stored in the North Tank Storage Area of the PRC.\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the ethylene process would be if the entire contents of the isobutane storage tank (filled to maximum allowable storage quantity) were to be instantaneously released, finds an ignition source, resulting in an explosion.  This scenario assumes complete compromise of containment by the tank and instantaneous release of the entire contents of isobutane.  This scenario does not consider any of the preventative controls that are in place.  The 1 psi overpressure of the explosion would extent 1,584 feet (or 0.3 miles) in all directions.  \r\nThe worst-case scenario for the ethylene process is identical to the isobutane scenario described above.  This scenario assumes complete compromise of containment of all the tubes in three tube trailers instantaneously releasing the entire contents of ethylene, finds an ignition source, resulting in an explosion.  This scenario does not consider any of the preventative controls that are in place.  The 1 psi overpressure of the explosion would extent 1,584 feet (or 0.3 miles) in all directions.  The 1 psi overpressure range for the ethylene process is 1,584 feet (or 0.3 miles) in all directions.\r\nThe RMP regulation uses 1 psi overpressure as the maximum allowable public exposure from a worst-case scenario.  The closest public receptors to the North Storage Tank Area are the Siemens Administration Building, Bartlesville Roundup Club Grounds, Bartlesville Airport Property (portion South of Highway 60), and the Phillips Gymnastics Center located to the north, west, west, and east of the PRC, respectively.  \r\nThe Bartlesville Roundup Club Grounds is not normally expected to have public receptors within the 1 psi overpressure ra"

      "SummaryText": "The Phillips 66 Research Center (PRC) is a facility that is committed to the overall safety and well-being of Phillips 66 employees, contract employees, and the community of Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  This commitment is demonstrated through the development and utilization of the various risk management systems currently in place at the PRC.  These systems primarily focus on the prevention of any incident which may have adverse consequences to the PRC work force, surrounding community, or the environment.  Risk management systems that emphasize prevention of chemical spill or release incidents include:\r\n\r\n1.\tHazard Assessments\r\n2.\tProcess Hazard Analyses\r\n3.\tProcess Safety Procedures\r\n4.\tTraining\r\n5.\tMaintenance and Mechanical Integrity\r\n6.\tPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n7.\tCompliance Audits\r\n8. \tManagement of Change Policy\r\n9.\tContractor Involvement\r\n10.\tEmployee Participation, and\r\n11.\tHot Work Permitting System\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the PRC has developed a comprehensive Emergency Plan (EP).  The EP is a written plan that describes the emergency response system currently utilized at the PRC.  The system identifies specific roles and responsibilities of all personnel involved in the emergency response process.  These roles are identified for all organizational levels of the PRC, including management and emergency response teams.  The EP provides an outline of the organization and procedures to be utilized in response to any major emergency.  Such procedures are directly identified with and applicable to chemical release scenarios.  Periodic drills are conducted to evaluate and refine the EP systems and processes. These drills are often coordinated with local emergency response entities such as the Washington County LEPC, Jane Phillips Medical Center, and the Bartlesville Fire Department.\r\n\r\nTwo chemicals are currently stored and utilized in different processes at the PRC which exceed threshold quantities stipulated in EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.
