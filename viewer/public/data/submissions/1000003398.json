      "SummaryText": "on 1321 Narrows Road near Lucas, Kentucky \n\napproximately 10 miles southeast of Glasgow.  The Lucas WTP withdraws and treats \n\nwater from Barren Lake for distribution of potable water to the surrounding areas.\n\n \n\nThe Lucas WTP utilizes a Wallace & Tiernan vacuum operated, Automatic switchover, \n\ngaseous feed system.  Four 1-ton containers of chlorine are piped together to provide \n\nuninterrupted flow of chlorine.\n\n \n\nThe maximum inventory at the WTP includes six 1-ton chlorine containers.  Under \n\nnormal circumstances, two full containers and two containers in use are piped together and \n\nsituated on the scale apparatus and up to two full containers of chlorine are stored \n\nwithin the same room.  The maximum amount of chlorine on-site at one time would \n\nbe less than 12,000 pounds.  Currently, the feed rate for chlorine ranges from \n\napproximately 200 \u00c2\u00bf 500 pounds per day.\n\n \n\n3) Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe predicted worst-case release scenario for chlorine is a catastrophic release of one \n\n(full) chlorine container within the chlorination room.  This enclosure will limit the \n\ndispersion of both liquid and vapor to the atmosphere during a release.  For this \n\nscenario, 2,000 pounds of chlorine liquefied under pressure are assumed to be \n\nreleased in 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 air dispersion modeling \n\nsoftware, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is predicted to be 2.2 miles.  \n\n \n\nAs an input parameter for RMP*Comp the topography surrounding the WTP was \n\nconsidered \u00c2\u00bfrural\u00c2\u00bf.  It should be noted that this parameter is not directly correlated to \n\npopulation density.  Rather, the topography surrounding the facility is characterized \n\nas either having many obstructions \u00c2\u00bf \u00c2\u00bfurban\u00c2\u00bf or generally flat with few obstacles \u00c2\u00bf \n\n\u00c2\u00bfrural\u00c2\u00bf.  Because the WTP is located adjacent to the lake, the surface of the water is \n\nconsidered the dominant feature in the topography surrounding the facility (see \n\nSection 3.3).  For this reason, the to"

The number of residences and other \n\npublic and environmental receptors associated with this radius was provided by \n\nGlasgow Water Company personnel from GIS data using the latitude and longitude of \n\nthe facility and a radius of 2.2 miles provided by EMPE.\n\n \n\n4) Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the WTP chlorination process is based on the \n\nevents that led to a chlorine release in October 1996.  For this scenario, a lead \n\ngasket is not properly installed when the vacuum regulator assembly is leak tested. \n\nBefore the main valve to the cylinder can be closed, chlorine gas is released, \n\nforcing WTP personnel to evacuate the chlorination room.  The chlorine container continues\n\nto release chlorine gas for one hour until the release is mitigated by emergency \n\nresponders.\n\n \n\nThis release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 software by \n\nassuming that the temperature and pressure of the container at the time of the leak are \n\n77 degrees F and 113 pounds per square inch (psi).  The release was modeled as \n\ndischarge of gas from a 1/8 inch diameter hole (area = 0.0123 square inches) at the \n\nabove temp and pressure.  Off-site consequences analysis using RMP*Comp resulted \n\nin a radius of impact of 0.1 miles.  Visual inspection indicates that there is a \n\nrecreation area and 2 residences located within this radius, comprising a total \n\npopulation of 6 people.\n\n \n\nBecause the specific gravity of chlorine is 2.49 (air = 1.29), chlorine vapor is more \n\ndense than air.  As a result, chlorine vapor may collect and/or migrate along low-lying \n\nareas in and around the facility.  This is particularly important due to the fact that the \n\nchlorination room is located immediately adjacent to Barre"

However, the \n\nmigration of chlorine vapor in the event of an actual release will be highly dependent \n\nupon the atmospheric conditions and release scenario at that time of the release.\n\n \n\n5) General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Lucas WTP maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly \n\nHazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and \n\nSafety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.

      "SummaryText": "a maximum capacity of four \n\nmillion gallons per day (MGD). After treatment, the waste water is discharged to \n\nHiggens Branch.  \n\n \n\nChlorine gas is injected into the water for disinfection purposes.  The chlorine system \n\nutilizes a Wallace & Tiernan vacuum operated, automatic switchover gaseous feed \n\nsystems with two 1-ton containers piped together to provide uninterrupted flow of \n\nchlorine.  Currently, the feed rate for chlorine ranges from approximately 30 \u00c2\u00bf 100 \n\npounds per day.\n\n \n\nThe maximum chlorine inventory at the WWTP includes three 1-ton chlorine \n\ncontainers.  Under normal circumstances, a full container and a container in use are \n\npiped together and situated on the scale apparatus and a third 1-ton container is stored \n\nin an adjacent room separated by steel sliding doors that are kept closed unless \n\nemployees are in the Scale Room.\n\n \n\n3) Worst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe predicted worst-case release scenario for chlorine is a catastrophic release of one \n\n(full) chlorine container within the Scale Room.  This enclosure will limit the \n\ndispersion of both liquid and vapor to the atmosphere during a release.  For this \n\nscenario, 2,000 pounds of chlorine liquefied under pressure are assumed to be \n\nreleased in 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 air dispersion modeling \n\nsoftware, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is predicted to be 0.9 miles.  \n\n \n\nAs an input parameter for RMP*Comp, the topography surrounding the WWTP was \n\nconsidered \u00c2\u00bfurban\u00c2\u00bf.  It should be noted that this parameter is not directly correlated to \n\npopulation density.  Rather, the topography surrounding the facility is characterized \n\nas either having many obstructions \u00c2\u00bf \u00c2\u00bfurban\u00c2\u00bf or generally flat with few obstructions \u00c2\u00bf \n\n\u00c2\u00bfrural\u00c2\u00bf.  It was determined that because the WWTP was surrounded by trees and \n\nrolling hills, the topography would be characterized as \u00c2\u00bfurban\u00c2\u00bf for modeling \n\npurposes.\n\n \n\nThis 0.9 mile radius encompasses approximately 259 reside"

The number of residences and other public \n\nand environmental receptors associated with this radius was provided by Glasgow \n\nWater Company personnel from GIS data using the latitude and longitude of the \n\nfacility and a radius of 0.9 miles provided by EMPE.\n\n \n\n4) Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe proposed alternative release scenario for this facility is the rupture of a 3/8 inch \n\ndiameter flexible metal connector that conveys chlorine gas under pressure from the \n\nton container to the piping manifold.  As a result, a rupture of this line would result in \n\nan unmitigated discharge of chlorine vapor from the container.\n\n \n\nFor this release scenario, the delivery line is ruptured or severed and chlorine vapor \n\ndischarges from the end of the line at a pressure equal to that of the container.  It is \n\nassumed that the release occurs when the temperature of the container is 77 degrees F \n\nat a pressure is 113 pounds per square inch (psi).\n\n \n\nGiven a hole diameter of 0.11 inches at this temperature and pressure, RMP*Comp \n\ncalculated a release rate of 20.9 pounds of chlorine per minute.  The release will \n\nproceed at this rate for 1 hour, at which time the release is stopped by local \n\nemergency responders. \n\n \n\nOff-site consequences analysis using RMP*Comp resulted in a radius of impact of \n\n0.1 miles.  Using the methodology described in the worst-case scenario above, it was \n\ndetermined that there are no environmental or public receptors located within this \n\nradius.\n\n \n\nBecause the specific gravity of chlorine is 2.49 (air = 1.29), chlorine vapor is more \n\ndense than air.  As a result, chlorine vapor may collect and/or migrate along low-lying \n\nareas such as the Higgens Branch, to the southeast of the facility.  However, the \n\nmigration of chlorine vapor in the event of an actual release will be highly dependent \n\nupo"
