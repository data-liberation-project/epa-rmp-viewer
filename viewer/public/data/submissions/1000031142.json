The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(1). The Prevention Elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) System prepared in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and State requirements. The chlorination process at the Mayaguez RWWTP uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO, and EQB. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Mayaguez RWWTP observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Mayaguez RWWTP and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Mayaguez RWWTP outfall terminates in a high-rate diffuser located in the Atlantic Ocean. Chlorine is used to treat the water in order to eliminate objectionable odors.\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in 1-ton and 150 pounds containers. Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators, a system that regulates vacuum and chlorine flow in the system.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program is composed of many elements and its objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment and the property.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nPRASA has an emergency response program. Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early det"

The emergency response program is coordinated with the local Emergency Management Agency  for notification of the public. (PRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training.)\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety; issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program. \r\n\r\nAudits\r\n\r\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on October 6, 2010. But during the past two years we have conducted internal metrics evaluations. With each metrics evaluation we request an action plan to correct the findings. PRASA has develop these metrics evaluation to establish the level of compliance of our facilities with the RMP/PSM Program."
