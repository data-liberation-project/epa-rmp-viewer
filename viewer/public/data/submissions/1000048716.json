      "SummaryText": "Fountain Hills Sanitary District (FHSD) is required to prepare a Risk Management Plan, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, due to the on-site storage of greater than 2,500 pounds of liquid chlorine.  The chlorine is used as a routine part of daily operations at the Advanced Water Treatment Facility (AWTF).\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers a new facility constructed to house approximately 6,000 lbs of chlorine to allow for further disinfection of wastewater effluent prior to groundwater recharge.  Chlorine cylinders will be contained in a unit called a Chlortainer.  A Chlortainer is essentially a metal containment vessel with a hinged door.  These units are designed to keep chlorine from escaping the vessel.  However, in the unlikely event that chlorine does escape the vessel, FHSD will determine the severity of the leak.  If the leak is minor and can safely be mitigated, staff will do so with support from the Fountain Hills Fire Department.  If the chlorine leak cannot be safely mitigated, the fire department will take control of the incident and determine what the next steps are.  During this time, all individuals will be evacuated to a safe location while following the FHSD emergency action plan.        \n\n\n\nFHSD uses a series of safe handling procedures to ensure the proper handling of the 1-ton chlorine cylinders and safe handling of chlorine throughout the AWTF.  These procedures are documented in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The SOPs are clearly visible in the chlorine building, and are reviewed as part of initial and annual refresher training. These procedures include: safe handling for loading and unloading chlorine cylinders, start-up, normal operations, cylinder change-out, normal shut-down, and temporary operations.\n\n\n\nFHSD operates a redundant chlorine alarm system with a full emergency power back-up system.  The system is tested on a routine basis.  Any leaks detected by this system will result in an automatic shutdown of chlorine g"

The AWTF chlorine system is a newly constructed facility thus, there have been no accidental releases in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nAt this time there are no planned changes to improve safety.  FHSD employees will report any safety or operational suggestions or concerns of the system to their section manager.  If any changes are needed to improve the safety of the chlorine system, they will be made in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThe AWTF is a tertiary wastewater treatment facility included in SIC Code 4952 and NAICS Code 22132.  The completed Registration Form is located in Appendix A.\n\n"
