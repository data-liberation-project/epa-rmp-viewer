The policy mandates CGA G-2.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Company Policy also requires the implementation of specific engineering and administrative controls to prevent releases. Airgas Specialty Products does not respond to releases but maintains an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with local responders.\nAnhydrous and aqueous ammonia at a concentration greater than 20% are stored and distributed from this location. Ammonia is stored in ASME coded pressure vessels and maintained in totally enclosed systems from trailer to storage tank to distribution vessels, minimizing transfer losses and accidental release potential.\nThe worst case release scenario is based upon the release of anhydrous ammonia from the largest single vessel. No administrative controls were included in the calculation which may mitigate the distance to endpoint. The alternate release scenarios for anhydrous and aqueous ammonia are more likely than the worst case and are based upon a hose failure.\nAirgas Specialty Products has developed and implemented procedures specific to storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia to meet the requirements of a prevention program as outlined in the regulation. Process safety information was gathered specific to the process and a process hazard analysis was developed and provided to all employees. All other elements of hte prevention program have been complied with as well.\nThis Airgas Specialty Products location has not had any RMP defined accidental releases in the past 5 years.  Airgas Specialty Products has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. The plan includes procedures for informing all on-site personnel as well as the required notification of emergency response personnel (local fire department, state and federal agencies).\nAs this is a newer f"
