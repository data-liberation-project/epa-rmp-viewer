Raw materials consisting primarily of various food ingredients are stored on-site in various forms such as dry storage warehouse, silo, and refrigerators/freezers.  Operations include pie crust mixers, pie filling lines, ovens for baking pie crust, kettles for mixing and cooking pie fillings, refrigerated storage and flash freezers, and shipping and receiving operations.  Pancake operations involve a flour silo, dry mixing operations, and packaging.  Finally, syrup operations involve kettles for cooking syrup and a small bottle filling line.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has ancillary operations that include utilities, cooling towers, and refrigeration systems.  The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system that contains approximately 13,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  No other regulated substances are on-site in amounts that would trigger RMP and/or PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nFoxtail Foods is subject to a number of rules and regulations regarding the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Foxtail complies with the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) through submittal of emergency planning information and annual chemical inventories to the State of Ohio, Butler County and the local fire department.
