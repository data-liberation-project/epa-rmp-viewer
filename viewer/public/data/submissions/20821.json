      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDan Tudor & Sons utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their \nWoollomes Avenue cold storage facility near Delano, California.  As it is Dan \nTudor & Sons' policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the \ncold storage facility was designed and constructed during 1995 to the 1991 \nUniform Building Code/Uniform Mechanical Code.  Personnel from Dan Tudor & \nSons monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All service, \nmaintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to \na qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  \nUtilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, \nmaintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating \ncondition. \n\nWhile it is Dan Tudor & Sons' objective to be a responsible citizen of the \ncommunity in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage \nfacility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency \naction plan has been prepared for Dan Tudor & Sons and a chain of command to \nrespond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nDan Tudor & Sons owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 33398 \nWoollomes Avenue.  Delano is the closest city to the Dan Tudor & Sons cold \nstorage facility.  The rural plant was constructed during 1995 utilizing all new \nequipment at the time of construction. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for \nthe Dan Tudor & Sons cold storage facility.  The refrigeration system consists of \na suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three compressors, an \nevaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, and several flooded \nevaporators.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the \nrefrigeration syste"

      "SummaryText": "m.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire \nrefrigeration system can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from the \nsystem and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 15,390 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could \nimpair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Dan Tudor & Sons' ammonia-based refrigeration system is considered a \nProgram 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite \nconsequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  \nThis area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the \nrelease would travel with concentrations at or above the toxic endpoint.  The \ncircle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total"

For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Dan Tudor & Sons, the alternative release \nscenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis \n(PHA) for the ammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release event with \na high discharge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact.  Although \nnot likely to occur, a release from a pressure relief valve was chosen as the \nalternative release scenario.    \n\nDan Tudor & Sons has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and \nalternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the release \nof 15,390 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period outside of the engine room, \nthe plume would travel 1.5 miles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  \nUsing 1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the worst-\ncase release scenario circle is 64 persons.  Due to the rural location of this \nfacility, the population potentially affected by this worst case release is \nsubstantially overstated by the 1990 Census data.  The public receptors included \na couple of residences.  There were no environmental receptors within the worst \ncase release scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a release from a pressure relief valve was \nmodeled as ammonia vapor stored under pressure.  For a release of 158.7 lb/min \nof anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere, the model calculated that the plume \nwould travel 0.1 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint.
