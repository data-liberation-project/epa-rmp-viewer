To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is however a single person identified who has overall responsibility for the PSM and RMP.  Program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is scheduled to be reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit is created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from thehazard analysis are addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Price Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility intent that the PSM/RMP for the facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental released of ammonia will occur due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear. \nThis facility is used for the storage of fruits, using ammonia as the refrigerant for the cold storage rooms.\n\nRelease Considerations\nFollowing program guidelines a \u00c2\u00bfWorse Case\u00c2\u00bf release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.

Company personnel have been trained in notification and evacuation procedures.

Price Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility has also coordinated with the Yakima County LEPC and with the local emergency responders (Gleed Fire Department).\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\nPrice Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility holds quarterly safety committee meetings with all Management representatives where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  There is also a regular staff meeting for all staff supervisors.  Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.
