THE FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management, and employees of Elko Solutions, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of ammonia hydroxide by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and Department of Emergency Government so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  Five years ago a full scale simulated spill response of a regulated substance was held at Elko and involved area police and sheriff departments, fire departments, medical personnel and evacuation units and the Department of Emergency Government.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of chemical solutions for sale to farmers as fertilizers.  Ammonia hydroxide is received, stored and used for blending in a mixing operation to make these fertilizer analyses.  The maximum quantity stored would be 120,000 pounds in the facility's tank dedicated for ammonia.  The capacity of this tank is 85 tons.\n\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:  This would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released into the containment area.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used (Degadis) is 0.56 miles.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:  This is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a three-inch transfer hose, with 1000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.06 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers and storage facilities.  The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Pro"

      "SummaryText": "tection has rigid inspection procedures and safety requirements for all facilities in the state.  They are especially active in spill prevention and emergency cleanups.  Julie Sarton, Treasurer of Elko, has been a charter member of the local emergency planning commission for 12 years, and has spent two years on the advisory council for environmental spill and cleanup with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection.\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of ammonia hydroxide for the covered process in the past five years.\n\n7.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Weekly inspections are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  The facility also conducts a weekly inventory of each tank, as well as a daily visual inspection and lock down of each tank.  There are no additional specific ammonia hydroxide safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
