As of the May 2018 RMP update, certain tasks identified during the Change Management process, which included adding automation equipment and associated programming on the proposed intermodal transfer line between Rail Rack R-5 and Truck Rack T-8, have not been completed; the proposed change in Isopentane IMO operations has not occurred.  \r\n\r\nVINYL ACETATE MONOMER STORAGE AND TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nStorage Tank P50-5 is an existing internal floating roof (\"IFR\") tank at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with a maximum working capacity of approximately 50,142-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of approximately 16,400,000-pounds.  Tank P50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case release scenario, was placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.

On the evening of August 23, 2013 nitrogen pressure was being used to unload a rail car containing TDI into one of Stolthaven Houston's three D-Tank Farm TDI storage tanks.  As the rail car was being unloaded, the rail switching crew on-duty coupled the terminal's locomotive to a string of rail cars, including the working TDI rail car, and began to pull the cars away from the rail rack.  As the rail car being emptied of TDI was moved from the unloading spot, the TDI cargo hose released from the top of rail car, and the 1-inch valve connected to the plant nitrogen hose was sheared off of the rail car.  Nitrogen pressure in the rail car caused approximately 4,500-gallons of TDI to be released from the sheared 1-inch valve opening on the top of the rail car into the Rail Rack R-2 concrete containment area, with a small amount of liquid TDI released onto an in-plant concrete road adjacent to the Rail Rack R-2 in the center of the facility.  There was no off-site release of TDI liquid.  A Stolthaven Houston operator on duty at the rail rack immediately closed the rail rack TDI product line valve leading to the storage tank being filled, and the TDI liquid release from the rail car stopped once the residual nitrogen pressure in the car reached atmospheric pressure.  A third-party environmental response contractor was contacted within an hour of this release to assist with the necessary clean-up efforts, which were completed on the late afternoon of August 27, 2013.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this incident, the following corrective actions were implemented by Stolthaven Houston Inc. after review by the terminal'"
