      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Pilgrim's Pride Bossier City Further Processing facility.  The reason for submitting this RMP is to report the change of ownership from Wayne Farms LLC to Pilgrim's Pride Corporation.  This facility has one refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention program is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and to minimize the negative consequences should a release occur.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to continuously improving the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention program is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release of ammonia.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact if a release was to occur.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the local Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained to properly respond to an emergency situation.  Drills are conducted and critiques are made to improve the response process.  The Emergency Response plan is designed to comply with all government response agencies.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n*  Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n*  Written Partner Participation program\n*  Preven"

Our partners were instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  Anhydrous Ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and equipment information has been compiled.  Pilgrim's Pride Corporation follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system.  Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing aparatus (SCBA) and air purifying respirators for the refrigeration partners, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  Refrigeration partners are provided with HAZMAT training on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, periodical Compliance Audits and Process Hazard Analyses are performed to enhance continued safe performance.  Several recommended actions to improve safety were identified during these audits and reviews and are being tracked regularly for timely completion.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this facility, including consideratio"
