In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\nEmergency Response Program\nWorld Class Distribution, Inc. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community. The EAP covers procedures for: 1)  evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure. Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP. In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department for assistance as necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA Process Hazard Analysis study has been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system. This review has resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility. The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment. World Class Distribution, Inc. is implementing these action items. In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make  improvements."

The vapor in the vessel is pulled off by the associated compressors and discharged to the condensers. At the condensers, the vapor is condensed back into liquid, which then drains to the receiver to be re-used in the refrigeration cycle.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nWorld Class Distribution, Inc. has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP regulations. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n- Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n- Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n- Training for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\n- Written procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\n- Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\n- Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\n- Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n- Employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment. These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits. Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization. Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nAs this facility is new construction, a review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet t"

This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility. For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system. World Class Distribution, Inc. has also\ndeveloped a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition. Only trained refrigeration technicians with the refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations and maintenance. All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility. In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur. At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nWorld Class Distribution, Inc. is located at 24098 Ruther Glen Rd in Ruther Glen, Virginia. Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of food products. The system uses a maximum of 40,000 pounds of ammonia. A description of how the process operates is presented below:\n\nLiquid ammonia in the high pressure / thermosyphon receiver is fed to the compressors for oil cooling and the high temp recirculator. The recirculator pumps liquid to the associated evaporators and medium temp recirculator. The medium temp recirculator pumps liquid to the associated evaporators and low temp recirculator. The low temp recirculator pumps liquid to the associated evaporators and low low temp recirculator. The low low temp recirculator pumps liquid to the associated evaporators. At the evaporators, air is drawn over the coils by the fans. The ammonia flowing inside the coils is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the surrounding"
