Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThis plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, this plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new"

This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the PCS Nitrogen plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.
