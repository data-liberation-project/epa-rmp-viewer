      "SummaryText": "The City of Spokane Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant is located inside Riverside State Park on the Spokane River.  It processes 44 million gallons of sewage daily from the sewer systems in the Spokane area.  It can also process an additional 77 million gallons of stormwater per day.  The plant is managed as a public utility called the City of Spokane Wastewater Management Department.\n\nThe Plant is commited to safe operation, as stated in Mission Statement of the City of Spokane Risk Management and Safety Manual, which is:\n\"To protect the City from loss by:\n+ minimizing financial risk\n+ promoting physical well being of employees and citizens who come in contact with City operations, and\n+ preventing the disruption of services.\"\n\nThe overall plant operation begins at the headworks building, where a mechanical bar screen separates large solids and an aerated grit chamber allows inorganic solids to settle.  The sewage is then transferred to primary treatment, where solids settle from the liquid waste in four primary clarifiers.  The liquid is transferred to the aeration basins, where dissolved solids are processed by an activated sludge.  The contents of the aeration basins are transferred to the secondary clarifiers, where the sludge is separated from the water. The water is disinfected with chlorine and flows to a contact basin.  At the end of the basin sulfer dioxide is added to deactivate any residual chlorine.  Solids from the primary and secondary clarifiers are sent to the gravity belt thickeners and then to the anerobic digesters.  Methane gas is produced in the digesters.  The methane is burned in a waste gas boiler to produce steam, which is used to heat the digesters and buildings.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan covers three processes:\n+  Chlorination:  Chlorine is dispensed from one-ton cylinders to disinfect the effluent before it leaves the plant.  Chlorine, which is toxic, is stored as a liquid under pressure.  Equipment used in this area is designed speci"

Chlorine detectors are placed in the surrounding area to alert personnel if a release occurs.  The area is also monitored by closed circuit television.\n+  De-chlorination:  Sulfur dioxide is dispensed from one-ton cylinders to deactivate residual chlorine to prevent harm to aquatic life after the effluent is discharged.  It is handled in the same building as chlorine and the safeguards listed for chloriine also apply to sulfur dioxide.\n+  Digester Gas:  Methane is collected from the digesters and used to fire waste heat boilers that generate steam for plant use.  Methane, which is the primary component of natural gas is flammable and poses an explosion hazard.  Operators are qualified as Stationary Engineers and follow procedures to assure safe operation.\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive safety program that includes monthly training in safe procedures to protect employees from injury and to comply with WISHA standards.  The City of Spokane Risk Management and Safety Manual is used to ensure that all requirments are met.\n\nA Process Safety Manual guides safety activities for all three chemicals to assure compliance with both the EPA Risk Management Plan Rule and the WISHA standard for Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  These activities include:\n+  Involving employees in process hazard analyses, writing procedures, and reviewing safety performance\n+  Documentation of process safety information\n+  Conducting process hazard analyses\n+  Developing standard operating procedures\n+  Training operators and mechanics to perform those procedures\n+  Performing equipment inspections and tests to maintain the mechanical integrity of equipment and instrumentation\n+  Reviewing changes to the processes to review safety impacts\n+  Conducting pre-start-up safety reviews to confirm that changes were made as intended\n+  Inv"

Employees are trained to respond to releases immediately as long as it is within the capabilities of their equipment.  The City of Spokane Fire Department has drilled in the facility and is available to respond to a release that exceeds the capabilities of plant responders.\n\nThere was one incident in the plant in the last five years.  On May 10, 2004 a digester roof collapsed, resulting in one fatality, three employee injuries, and a spill of sewage to the Spokane River.  The methane in the digester did not ignite.  The quantity of methane released was estimated as ______ lbs.  This incident is still under investigation.\n\nRecommendations for improving safety that result from the incident investigation will be carefully reviewed and implemented."
