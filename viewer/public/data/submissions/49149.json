      "SummaryText": "The Great Bend Coop Executive Summary-Ellinwood Branch\nPrepared By: Dennis Neeland\n\n1. The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at the facility. Company policy and procedures are strictly followed when handling and storing NH3.\n\n2. The NH3 plant is located in the southwest corner of the City of Ellinwood. The plant has two storage tanks, one 26,000 gallon and one 11,000 gallon. The total storage capacity is 37,000 gallons.\n\n3. The Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 113,594 pounds in a 10 minute period or 11,359 pounds per minute with a 1.02 mile endpoint.\nAlternative release could involve a transfer hose rupture this would result in a release of 2900 pounds per minute in a 2 minute period with a .22 mile to end point.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\nThe Great Bend Coop recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by State and Federal Agencies and has annual training for the employees. The most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers: An example would be a nurse trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Great Bend policy is not to fill above 85%.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nThe Great Bend Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and a Safety Director. All areas have worked with the County, City and Insurance Loss Control Department for the development of these plans.\n\n7. Planned Safety Changes\nThe Company Safety Director, Operations Manager tour the Branch once per month. All areas are toured once a quarter. Changes are made on an as needed basis as new regulations or concerns arise."
