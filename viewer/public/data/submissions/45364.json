At the compressors, the pressure and temperature of the vapor is increased.  The compressed vapor is discharged through a common header to the three evaporative condensers and to the evaporators, where the hot compressor discharge is used for defrost purposes.  At the condensers, water and fans are used to remove heat from the compressor discharge, and the resulting high pressure liquid ammonia flows back to the Thermosyphon Receiver, where the cycle begins again.  Booster Compressors 1-3 draw suction from the Low Pressure Recirculator 1, while the Booster Compressors 4-7 draw suction from the Low Pressure Recirculator 2.  Booster Compressor #7 is a swing compressor and is piped to draw suction from either the Low Pressure Recirculator 1 or 2.  After the pressure and temperature of the vapor is increased, the Booster Compressor discharge is routed to the Intercooler where it is cooled. The relief valves on the high pressure vessels and compressors are set at 250 and 300  psig and 150 for the low pressure vessels.  The relief valves vent to atmosphere outside the engine room. \n\nC.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system.  The High Temperature Accumulator results in the highest release rate, and will therefore be used for the worst case release scenario.  The vessel is located outside the building, so no passive mitigation was considered.  The maximum ammonia release of 18,530 lbs. in 10 minutes is limited by the vessel size.  The unmitigated release rate is 1,853 lbs./minute.\n\nFor analyzing the worst case release scenario, EPA requires the use of the most pessimistic meteorological conditions that will allow for the maximum downwind exp"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe management and staff of the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant are committed to operating their facility with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant personnel, and the environment, the plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nB.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant operates refrigerated storage freezers and process equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the facility.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule ( and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver to the Controlled Pressure Receiver 2.  The Thermosyphon Receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the Ice Cream Barrel Freezer Evaporators and Storage Silos.  In addition, liquid ammonia is routed to the compressors for thermosyphon oil cooling or liquid injection oil cooling.  As heat is absorbed at the evaporators and process equipment, the ammonia is partially vaporized.  The"

The partially vaporized ammonia from the evaporators and chiller is drawn back to the High Temperature Accumulator.\n\nThe Intercooler provides subcooled liquid ammonia to the Low Pressure Recirculator 1 and 2 and the Palletizing/Ante Room Evaporators, East and West Dock Evaporators.  The temperature inside the Intercooler is maintained by the high side suction drawn by Compressors 1-4.  The partially vaporized ammonia at the evaporators is returned to the High Temperature Accumulator.  \n\nThe Low Pressure Recirculator 2 provides pumped low temperature liquid ammonia to the Penthouse and South Maintenance Warehouse Evaporators.

These safety features include ammonia sensors throughout the plant, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis occurred on January 29 & 30, 2003.  The analysis, which included a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, checklists and a facility walkthrough, provided the following mitigation measures to improve safety at the Safeway Phoenix Ice Cream Plant located at 2434 E. Pecan Road, in Phoenix, Arizona:\n\nR01:   Follow manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule to test, and if necessary, calibrate ammonia detectors.  Include in Mechanical Integrity Program. \n\nR02:   Conduct an ammonia awareness training program that includes informing all employees of the following: 1) the presence of and the hazards associated with ammonia at the facility, 2) how to recognize ammonia, 3) what to do if they observe an ammonia leak, and 4) where to go when they are told to evacuate.\n\nR03:   Establish a facility policy to prohibit the storage of flammable material near the ammonia system\n\nR04:   Implement a maintenance program to replace/recertify relief valves every five years (as per industry standard).  Automatically replace any relief valves that unseat.  Include in Maintenance Program.  NOTE: The relief valves were replaced as part of this renovation; therefore, they will be due in December 2007.\n\nR05:  Conduct an annual visual inspection of the entire ammonia system to check for corrosion.  Include in Mechanical Integrity Program.\n\nR06:  Consider installing a motor to circulate the water in the shower/eye wash stations.  Due to extreme temperatures, circulation of the water will help to prevent hot water from scolding an employee.\n\nR07:  Establish a policy for operators or maintenance personnel to check in and out when working in isolated areas (i.e. roof, catwalk freezer, etc.).\n\nR08:  Establish a policy to have o"
