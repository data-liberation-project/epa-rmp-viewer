The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include: Process Safety Information is available at all times.  A hazard review has been conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.  Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.  Training is provided to all employees who operate a system.  A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.  Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effect.  Routine audits are conducted to assure compliance and safe practices are followed.  The sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide.  Examples of safety equipment in place include, pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, door interlock system, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  In addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process; and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to ensure safety.  Sterigenics also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment before it fails.  In the unlikely event of a spill or release involving ethylene oxide, Sterigenics has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility.",

The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999. Sterigenics completed an update of the original RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMP*eSubmit in 2004 and 2009.

Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves. Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and some of the chamber doors that will alarm with an audible alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
