      "SummaryText": "The Minnesota Freezer Warehouse facility , located in Albert Lea, Minnesota is a provider of refrigerated and freezer warehouse services for various types of products mainly from food producers.  This plant has a closed loop refrigeration system containing ammonia for maintaining cooler and freezer temperatures for the handling and storage of the products. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at the plant to refrigerate rooms to maintain a correct temperature as required by the products stored.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the plant refrigeration system, providing the means to maintain specified temperature and / or remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the plant and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from rooms within the facility.\n\n\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this plant.  \n\n\n\nThe plant is undergoing an expansion of the existing ammonia refrigeration process in 2011.  This expansion will provide a refrigeration system that is mostly new.   This new system will result in the process containing more that 10,000 pound of ammonia and therefore an OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Plan has been implemented.  It is the intent of this warehouse to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  \n\n\n\nThe plant ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training, contractor explanation and t"

      "SummaryText": "raining (contractors are members of IIAR).  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.    Employees are initially trained and have refresher training in the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system and in the future will receive refresher training at least every three years.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is computer operated with on-site and remote access for control of the system.  If an alarm should occur, an auto dialing system contacts security who intern contacts warehouse staff.  An ammonia detection system within the warehouse is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  \n\n\n\nThe process has numerous safe guards including:  \n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n?    Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\n?    The plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n?    A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 2011.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents (none reportable); (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n?

      "SummaryText": "ures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n?    For plant projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n?    Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n?    The plant has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\n\n \n\nThe plant has an emergency response program based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes in-house response capabilities in the event of a release, procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The plant emergency action plan is based on  known applicable regulations and requirements and responders are trained as required.  \n\n\n\nThe plant has had no reportable release in the past five year history.  \n\n\n\n"
