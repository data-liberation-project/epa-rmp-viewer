As it is Sunview Cold Storage\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed in 1999 in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Building and Uniform Mechanical Codes.  The 2003-2004 expansion to the cold storage facility increased the amount of ammonia handled in the refrigeration system to a level above the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nSince the refrigeration system now handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Sunview Cold Storage has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.  As part of the PSM program, Sunview Cold Storage has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration process, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration process on a daily basis, Sunview Cold Storage has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration process is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage emphas safe and environmentally sound operating practices through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  While it is Sunview Cold Storage\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action pla"

At least every three years, Sunview Cold Storage will audit these programs and any findings of noncompliance will be documented and responded to and the deficiencies will be corrected.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 31543 Peterson Road.  McFarland is the closest community to the Peterson South facility.  The rural plant was constructed during 1999 utilizing all new equipment at the time of construction.  The cold storage facility was expanded in the fall of 2003.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides cooling for the Peterson South facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, five compressors, four evaporative condensers, a thermal siphon receiver, a high pressure receiver, two pre-cool rooms, six cold storage rooms, and the associated hallway, staging and shipping areas.  Bunker mounted accumulators are utilized to feed the flooded evaporators in the pre-cool and cold storage rooms.  The hallway, staging and shipping areas are cooled through direct expansion evaporators.  \r\n\r\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be \u00bfpumped down\u00bf to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the outdoor high pressure receiver is 18,600 pounds. \r\n\r\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the CalARP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous am"
