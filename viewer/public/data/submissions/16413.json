To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods, Noel, Missouri, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson, Noel, Missouri, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.

Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 17,250 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 17,250 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.63 before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\n\nAlternative release scenario  - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system "

The emergency response program.    \nA fully trained and equiped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\n\n\nEPA RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTYSON FOODS    Noel, Missouri\n\nAll Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and ("

Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level. \n\nThe training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure.  Technician level  training includes but is not limited to the following:\n7 Knowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\n7 Proper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\n7 Terminology associated with Hazmat\n7 Advanced site control/security procedures\n7 Advanced Containment/Control/Decon procedures\n7 Use of Atmospheric Monitoring Equipment and Contaminant Test Procedures\n7 Incident Command Structure Roles and Line of Authority\n7 Interaction with Local and State Officials\n7 Standard Operating Procedures for Clean-up and termination \n7 Critique\n\nOn Site facility Instructors have completed in excess of 40 hours of Instructor's training, achieving the Incident Command level, over the past 5 years and have instructed their team in approximately 120 hours of training.  \n\nAll training materials, hands-on drills and response procedures have been developed under the direction of the Corporate Loss Control Department.\n\nAll Team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately.  Supervisors and Leads are taught to report the above to the Safety or Process Manager immediately for\nfurther investigation and action by the Hazmat team.
