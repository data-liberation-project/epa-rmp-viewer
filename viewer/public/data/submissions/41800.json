Corbalis Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The Corbalis WTP is located on Stuart Road, approximately 4,000 feet south of Leesburg Pike, State Route 7.   Currently, construction efforts are underway to extend the Fairfax County Parkway along the west perimeter of the Corbalis WTP. \n\n\n\nThe Corbalis WTP is a drinking water provider and has a planned capacity to provide an  ultimate 200 million gallons of drinking water a day.   Operations at the J. Corbalis WTP fall into the 22131 Standard Industrial Classification.\n\n\n\nAt the J Corbalis WTP, the FCWA pumps, treats and distributes water from the Potomac River Watershed to customers in the Northern Virginia Region.  To ensure the highest quality drinking water is available to its customers, the FCWA uses chlorine as disinfectants to remove and control the growth of otherwise potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens in the drinking water supply.  Because of their relative toxicity, chlorine is listed as a regulated substance under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  Under the provisions, EPA requires that facilities having regulated chemical processes above the following thresholds implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) covering ea"

There is maximum inventory of 30 containers for a combined inventory of approximately 60,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe FCWA's RMP describes the potential environmental impacts and the toxicity hazards presented by the chlorine inventory at the J. Corbalis WTP.  Moreover, the RMP describes the FCWA's procedures to minimize the risk and prevent unwanted releases of either chemical into the surrounding communities.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe FCWA has adopted policies that comply with applicable federal, state, local, and institutional regulations for design, construction, operation, and modification of the water treatment plant facilities.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Chlorine\n\n\n\nWhile chlorine releases are rare at WTPs, the FCWA has conducted an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to evaluate the potential impacts on the surrounding \n\ncommunities should an unwanted release occur.  As directed by EPA regulations, the FCWA assumed a worst-case release scenario to consist of a 1-ton cylinder depleting its contents over a 10 minute release period.  Such a chlorine release would tend to sink, hug the ground, or follow low lying areas due to the fact that chlorine is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air.  Depending on the ambient weather conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) and the topography of the surrounding land, the chemical plume can impact the surrounding region and cause damage to human health and the environment.    \n\n\n\nTo determine how far from the Corbalis WTP a chlorine plume would travel from a 1-ton cylinder over a 10 minute release period, the FCWA utilized RMP Comp version 1.07.  Additionally, the FCWA utilized the Fairfax Joint Local Emergency Planning Committee's (FJLEPC"

      "SummaryText": ") modeling conducted consistent with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  These approaches conservatively estimate a potential impact area that is circular with the center being the point of release.\n\n\n\nFor the Corbalis WTP, the greatest mass that can be released from any chlorine process is equal to one 1-ton cylinder of chlorine.  Based upon the RMP Comp model the maximum distance to the end-point is approximately 0.9 miles.  The potential impact area is shown on Figure 1. \n\n\n\nIt is estimated that 5,100 people live within the boundaries of the potential impact area as identified on Figure 1.  Moreover, the potential impact area contains both public and environmental receptors. \n\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS FILE DELETED\n\n Alternate Release Scenario - Chlorine\n\n\n\nConsidering that the aforementioned worst-case release scenario is ultra-conservative and unrealistic in terms of the potential impact area, the FCWA is required to conduct an alternate release scenario for chlorine. This variation of the worst-case scenario is considered \"more realistic\" than the worst-case scenario.  The impact area must still include off-site receptors.  However, it is important to understand that although the occurrence of the alternate release scenario is considered as \"more realistic\"; the FCWA considers it still to be highly unlikely due to engineering and administrative controls at the Corbalis WTP.   \n\n\n\nEPA regulations encourage facilities to select the alternate release scenario from one that has occurred at some point in the past at the facility or from one identified through the process hazards analysis.  Due to no historical off-site releases at the Corbalis WTP, the alternate release scenario selected, although still unlikely, was one identified through the process hazard analysis.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, the alternate release assumed that the largest vessel of chlorine (1-ton cylinder) is released. \n\n\n\n    Figure 1 presents the alternate case release scenario estimat"

Corbalis WTP for chlorine in its 22 year operating history.\n\n\n\nOverview of the Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe EPA RMP regulations have three tiers of compliance based upon the relative degree of effort necessary to minimize the risk to off-site receptors.  The tiers are established as Program 1, Program 2 and Program 3.  As a rule of thumb, since the FCWA's off-site consequence analysis affected off-site receptors, the FCWA falls into the Program 3 tier requirement.   Moreover, the WTP is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety therefore making compliance with Program 3 criteria mandatory under the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nThe FCWA has established a management system to assign responsibility for the development, implementation, and modification of the RMP.  The overall responsibility for implementation is assigned to the Manager of Water Production, with specific responsibilities assigned to management level personnel with organizational responsibility for the individual tasks (i.e. plant maintenance).\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nThe FCWA maintains up-to-date process safety information on the chlorine processes at the J. Corbalis WTP.  This information is available to all operations, maintenance, and administrative employees for review.  The safety information includes:  \n\n\n\n1.
