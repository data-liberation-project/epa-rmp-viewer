      "SummaryText": "1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10\tAccidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Twin City Foods refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Twin City Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20\tFacility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\u00bf\tTwin City Foods is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\u00bf\tThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.30\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s"

Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView V (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nTwin City Foods complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\nTwin City Food's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Twin City Foods Risk Manager. \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate"

Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n1.50\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn October, 2004, a compressor flange gasket failed and released approximately 131 pounds of ammonia vapor through the compressor discharge line.  The leak was stopped and isolated by plant personnel in approximately 4 minutes.  There were no injuries experienced by anyone, including plant personnel, responders and bystanders.  New flange gaskets have been installed on all compressors.\n\n1.60\tEmergency Response Program\n\nTwin City Foods has a written Emergency Response Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of WISHA Emergency Response regulations, WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Prosser Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Twin City Foods and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\u00bf\tIncident Command Center\n\u00bf\tEmergency Alarm and Communication System\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Team\n\u00bf\tSafe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n\u00bf\tPersonal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally establis"

The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\nAll Twin City Foods personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Twin City Foods Engineering Supervisor.\n\n1.70\tPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\n\nThe high priority Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Recommendations have already been completed, including adding information to the daily checklists and formalizing operating procedures.  Twin City Foods is continuing to work on the lower priority items, including installing warning lights, additional fan switches and updating some of the operating procedures.  These changes are scheduled to be complete by spring of 2007."
