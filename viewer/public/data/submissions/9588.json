      "SummaryText": "The Rahway Valley Sewerage Authority (RVSA), a secondary treatment Publicly Owned\nTreatment Works (POTW), is located on the border of Union County and Middlesex County\nin the Town of Rahway.  Wastewater treatment operations include primary settling, aerated\nactivated treatment, secondary clarifying, and contact chlorination.  Sludge treatment includes\nthickening, dewatering, anaerobic digestion, final dewatering, and solids concentrating. \n\nAnaerobic digestion of sewage sludge produces methane gas that is used as fuel for stationary\nengines and a boiler at the facility.  Methane gas is produced as a result of microbial\ndegradation of organic material in the separated sludge.  This process takes place in three\nlarge digester tanks with expandable covers.  The covers float on the collected gas above the\nsludge volume.  The digesters are equipped with sludge and gas recirculation systems, as well\nas a heat circulation system to maintain maximum microbial activity.\n\nThis methane gas (or digester gas) is utilized in much the same way as natural gas would be\nand poses the same potential fire and explosive hazards.  Low-pressure gas flows out of the\ndigesters through pipes and valves to a separate building containing filters to remove sulfur\ncompounds.  After filtration, the low-pressure gas moves on to the compressor room where it\nis pressurized to approximately 40 pounds per square inch (psi).  The high-pressure gas is\ntransported via pipeline to another building (Pump and Blower Building) where it is burned in\ntwo stationary internal combustion engines and a boiler.  Another pipeline used to move low-pressure gas to boilers and engines in another building (Primary Building) has been shut-off\nand is no longer used.  \n\nThe RVSA employs flammable gas detectors to monitor the digester gas system.  The\ndigesters are also equipped with self-actuated pressure relief valves and gas flares to prevent\nover-pressurization and vacuum relief valves to prevent tank implosion.  In add"

      "SummaryText": "ition, facility\npersonnel monitor the components of the digester gas system daily.  Digester gas not only\nposes a fire and explosion hazard, but also the potential for asphyxiation.  All workers are\ncautioned in their activities around the digester gas system and their response to monitor\nalarms.  The RVSA takes worker safety seriously and all new workers are trained and tested\non facility equipment and procedures before they are allowed to perform tasks without\noversight.  \n\nFor the worst-case accident scenario, it is assumed that one of the digester tanks ( the one\nclosest to the property boundary) explodes with the maximum amount of gas contained within\nit, as recommended in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nGuidance.  Explosions of this type are highly unlikely, as the tanks are operated void of\noxygen and are at positive pressure so all leaks would push gas out of the tanks rather than\nallow oxygen in.  The worst-case scenario results in 1 psi over-pressure out to a distance of\n156 meters or just under 0.1 miles.  After trying several low probability but realistic\nalternative case scenarios without generating an off-site impact, an extremely unlikely scenario\nwas selected.  This scenario consists of a major break in one of the low pressure pipes which\nresults in the Digester Gas Building being filled with digester gas.  (Since no major\nmachinery can fit into the building and multiple safeguards exist to keep the lines from being\nworked on while gas is in that segment, this type of release was ruled as unrealistic during the\nhazardous review performed in conjunction with this RMP.)   The alternate scenario also\nassumes that just at the time the methane concentration reaches the upper explosive limit a\nstatic spark ignites a vapor cloud explosion.  For this explosion, the 1 psi over-pressure wave\nreaches 118.5 meters which constitutes an off-site impact to the immediate West.  However,\nfor this over-pressurization to actually reach any fen"

      "SummaryText": "celine within this distance, it must blow\nout the walls of the Digester Gas building and then level at least one of the three digester tanks\nwhile retaining enough explosive force to still generate a 1 psi off-site pressurization.\n\nThe RVSA currently is not subject to federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA) worker safety regulations.  Oversight is provided by the New Jersey Department of\nLabor Office of Employee Safety (PEOSHA).  To date federal OSHA and PEOSHA have not\nrequired POTWs to comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations in\nregards to the digester gas operations.  However, the program elements of the RMP will\naccomplish a majority of the goals of the PSM Program.\n\nThe RVSA has not had an accident associated with the digester gas system in over five years. \nThe facility now has in place a formal Accident Reporting and Investigation Program that will\nprovide appropriate review and follow-up to future incidents at the facility.\n\nThe RVSA undergoes annual safety inspections by the Rahway Fire Department (most recently on June 8, 1999) and their fire insurance carrier, NewJersey Manufacturers (most recently in March, 1999).  Additional inspections that have occurred include:\n               1)     PEOSHA - April 24, 1992\n               2)     NJDEP Right-To-Know - August 1, 1995\n               3)     Workers Compensation (Insurance) - July 13, 1998\n\nShould a fire or explosion occur at the facility that is associated with the digester gas system,\nRVSA will not respond with on-site personnel.  The RVSA has in place a mechanism to\ncontact the Rahway Fire Department for response.  RVSA personnel will be evacuated, if\nnecessary, or moved away from the accident area.\n\nRVSA currently has generic facility programs in place for the elements of the RMP program. \nOver the course of the following year, these elements will be updated and revised to be\nspecific to the digester gas system."
