The quantities stored at each facility is as follows: Little Choctawhatchee-8,000 lbs. of chlorine gas and 8,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide;  \n\nThe worst case scenerio for all three wastewater treatment plants would result in a maximum threat zone for sulfur dioxide of 3.2 miles.  Based on the 2,000 cencus, this release will affect residential population of 6,400 from Little Choctawhatchee.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide will affect a residential population of 4,300 from Little Choctawhatchee.  The alternate release scenario for chlorine will affect a residential population of 3,500 from Little Choctawhatchee within 2.4 miles.\n\nThe WWT Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule , although Alabama is not an OSHA state.  The WWT Division conduct training for all operators in SOP, safe handling, and emergency response procedures.  All safety equipment is regularly inspected and calibrated.  Both training and inspections are documented.\n\nThe WWT Division has had no accidental releasees of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas in the last five years.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, WWT plant personnel will notify the Dothan Fire Department by either radio or land line.  The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas. \nThe City of Dothan Fire Dept. conducts quarterly emergency response drills.\n\nPerimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\nThe WWT Division reveiws SOP, conduct haza"
