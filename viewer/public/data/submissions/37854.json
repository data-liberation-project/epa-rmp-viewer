The company actively supports the guiding principles of the Business Charter for Sustainable Development of the International Chamber of Commerce and the Responsible Carea initiative of the American Chemistry Council. These principles are applied throughout the plant site and are not limited solely to those areas or processes covered by regulation.\n\nSafety, health and environment issues are integral parts of the company?s business plans. Specific annual goals in each of these areas are set forth in the annual business plan and individual employees have safety, health and environmental goals within their own personal objectives.\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry, LLC works towards the prevention of all accidents associated with its activities and those of its contractors. The company protects the community and the environment by preventing or reducing the impact of its activities and its products through appropriate design, maintenance, distribution, use, and disposal practices.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Site Emergency Response Plan is designed to minimize hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or releases of hazardous materials to air, soil, or surface water. The plan provides for the coordination between Federal, State, and Local agencies depending upon the nature, extent, and severity of the incident.\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry, LLC supports these policies through training of its employees in both standard plant operations and emergency response. Documentation of procedures and training requirements are maintained through the site documentation control system.\n\nThe company has also committed to supporting the Local Emergency Planning Committee with both monetary and personnel resources.\n\n\n2.

The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying 26 acres. An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of wastewater before it is discharged to Aux Sable creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\n\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs approximately 122 people and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, primarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils. The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil. Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\n\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\n\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into organic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin.  The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further processing into soap and personal care products.\n\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where they are reacted with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form fatty nitrile. The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the continuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. The addition of acrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions are also be made in the batch hydrogenation units to form additional variations of secondary and tertiary amines.\n\nIn the quaternization unit tertiary amines are reacted with methyl chloride to form quaternary ammonium compounds.\n\nThe major products pr"

They are also used as surfactants in a wide range of other industrial processes including food, chemical, highway paving, metal processing, mining, petroleum, paint, ink, paper, pharmaceutical, rubber and polymer processing industries.\n\n2.2    Regulated Substances\n\nThe site has four substances that are covered by the Risk Management Plan regulations. These substances are raw materials and are acrylonitrile, ammonia, formaldehyde solutions and methyl chloride. A fifth raw material, hydrogen, is listed in the regulations but it is not covered by the regulation at the site because the maximum quantity at the site is below the minimum threshold quantity listed in the regulation.\n\n\n3.
