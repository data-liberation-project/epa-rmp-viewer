(Ag Facility)\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Dows Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the North Central Regional Planning District will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT FARMERS COOPERATIVE COMPANY, DOWS, IOWA:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a parking lot staging area for nurse tanks. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nNurse tanks are filled and positioned awaiting distribution and transportation from the parking to the farm. The parking lot is separate from the storage tank facilities. In this instance, nurse tanks are parked in a lot that i"

The specific address of the parking lot is described in the registration section of this document.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the  largest nurse tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the transfer hose on the nurse tank or the act of vandals opening the liquid withdrawal valve to illegally obtain anhyydrous ammonia for methamphetamine production. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Dows,  provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Farmers Cooperative Company has extended to the Dows Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nFarmers Cooperative Company, Dows, Iowa has not experienced any  accidental release involving"

In the unlikely event that the Dows Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Dows location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Dows has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and North Central Regional Planning District. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant.
