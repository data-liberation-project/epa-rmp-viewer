The facility began operations in 1962, and Lion Copolymer purchased the facility in July 2007.  The RMP Plan is being resubmitted to reflect the current operations, which now has fewer processes and chemicals subject to the RMP regulation.\n\nThe facility has been a member of the Ascension Parish CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) program since 1985.  This organization is part of an on-going effort to maintain communications between industry and the general public with the appropriate law enforcement, emergency response personnel, and environmental agencies. This program integrates well with the existing Geismar Plant Emergency Response Procedures, which are contained in the Geismar Policy Manual and include:\n     Bomb Threat,\n     Disaster Notification,\n     Release Reporting Procedures,\n     Incident Command/Planning and Response,\n     Assistance and Notification for Serious Injury,\n     Electrical Power Curtailment,\n     Gas Release Procedure,\n     Hurricane Preparedness,\n     Geismar Mutual Aid,\n     Plant Fire Brigade,\n     Riot and Civil Disturbances,\n     Steam Usage Curtailment,\n     Tornadoes,\n     Community Inquiry,\n     Security Reporting,\n     Hazwoper Safety and Health Plan, and\n     Unusual Incident Reporting.\n \nThe requirements in the RMP regulation to prevent accidental releases are being met at the Geismar facility by established programs which include:\n     Operator training and certification,\n     Work Permits,\n     Hazard Communications,\n     Management of Change for Process and Equipment,\n     Process Hazard Analysis,\n     Reports of Unsafe Conditions,\n     Safety Orientations,\n     Emergency response training,\n     Routinely updated operating procedures,\n     Computers and computerized control systems,\n     Emergency control / shutdown devices / interlocks,\n     Equipment / piping safe"

As a mark of this continuing improvement, the Geismar Plant is registered to the ISO 14001 international environmental standard and is an OSHA VPP Star facility.\n\nRMP REPORTABLE CHEMICALS\n \nThe Geismar Facility handles six RMP chemicals (four toxic and two flammable) with quantities above the regulation threshold.  Whenever possible, chemicals are handled by pipeline to reduce the impact in the event of a leak rather than stock-piling large amounts in storage tanks. \n \nThe RMP covered processes are Program 3 PSM processes that include raw material receiving, storage and handling and as such are controlled by all of the above-mentioned \"prevention\" and \"emergency response\" programs.  The chemicals of concern are discussed below.\n \nTOXIC:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Hydrazine are unloaded into storage tanks and are used in the manufacture of products which produce the foaming action in sponge products, and agricultural products.\n\nChlorine is stored onsite in two one-ton cylinders (2,000 lbs each) and used for water treatment.  \n\nEthyl Aluminum Sesquichloride (EASC) is known as Cat L in the ROYALENE production process and is regulated as an Alkyl Aluminum under the LDEQ Supplemental List of the Louisiana RMP regulation.  The RMP Submit Program does not allow this chemical to be entered; therefore it is not included in the submittal file.  This chemical is associated with a Program 3 PSM process and is included in the Executive Summary for documentation. \n\nFLAMMABLE:\n \nPropylene is used as a refrigerant in the ROYALENE production units.  A flammable mixture comprised of propylene, ethylene, propane, and ethane is contained in the ROYALENE and TRILENE production units.  Propylene and ethylene are used as raw materials and are delivered to the facility v"

This release involved a flammable mixture of hexane and catalyst (an Alkyl Aluminum), which ignited shortly after release.  The release generated Hydrogen Chloride and Nitrous Oxides as combustion products.  All appropriate agencies were contacted and the fire was extinguished at approximately 2:08 PM that same day.  The fire resulted in significant damage to the effected area.\n \nIn the event of an emergency situation, the Geismar plant has a certified team of medical first responders and on-site response tools to handle an environmental situation as per 1910.120(q).  Also, on site, is a fully equipped exterior, industrial fire brigade, a confined space/high angle rescue team, a HAZMAT/Incident Command team and trained Incident Commanders.  These teams are regularly drilled to handle fire fighting situations, confined space extractions and chemical release containment."
