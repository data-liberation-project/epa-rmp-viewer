      "SummaryText": "The Kellogg Company manufactures a variety of prepared food products at our facility in Zanesville.   We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration systems.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nKellogg's takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration systems.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nKellogg's Zanesville produces prepared food products for sale to the public.    The ammonia inventory for the refrigeration system is approximately 20,400 pounds.   Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Zanesville Plant.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nEPA requires us to define the worst case release scenario from the Zanesville plant as the release of 11,000 pounds of ammonia aver a 18-m"

      "SummaryText": "inute period due to the failure of a low pressure receiver. The 11,000 pounds represents the maximum amount of ammonia that would be contained in the receiver at any time.  This release would take place inside a building, which would reduce the impact of the release.  EPA also requires us to assume that the weather conditions are such that there is almost no wind and no mixing in the atmosphere.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario at the Zanesville plant would involve the release of 3,800 pounds of ammonia over a 15-minute period due to the rupture of a liquid line in the refrigeration system.  The duration of the release was estimated by determining the amount of time for the receiver associated with this line to empty.  Again, EPA required us to estimate the impact of this release under low wind and stable weather conditions.  \n\nBoth of these releases are unlikely for many reasons.  Our equipment and system were designed using industry standards for ammonia refrigeration.  We have taken precautions to protect our equipment from obvious threats, like vehicular traffic.   We have a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  Training programs are in place to ensure that qualified personnel operate the systems, and our emergency response procedures allow us to respond quickly in the event of an accident. \n\n\nD.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation Program \n- Process Safety Information \n- Process Hazard Analysis \n-  Operating Procedures\n-  Training Program\n- Contractor Safety Program\n-  Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n-  Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- "

Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the Zanesville plant over the past five years that resulted in significant of-site or offsite consequences. \n\n\nF.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Zanesville Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Zanesville Fire Department.\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nKellogg's is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective."
