The LPG operating unit is the only Process at the Terminal that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. This summary describes the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program in place at the Kapolei Terminal, which are aligned with the OSHA PSM elements. The objective of the RMP prevention programs and the PSM system is to reduce the consequences and/or likelihood of potential accidents at the Terminal.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nEmployees are actively involved in each element of the RMP prevention program at the refinery.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, operating & maintenance procedures, and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information generated from the Terminal accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention programs are documented in an employee participation policy that is maintained at the Terminal.  In addition, the Terminal has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives often include forming committees to address process and personal safety. The committees typically have members from various workgroups, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Regularly scheduled meetings are held with various employee groups to address a variety of process "

The goal of each investigation is to determine the cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for review and approval. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies.  Management reviews are regularly performed to ensure the quality of investigation program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nThe Terminal maintains a variety of procedures, drawings and technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents contain safety related information on topics such as process operation, process equipment, chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis.  The documents which are categorized as process safety information are defined in a policy maintained at the Terminal.  Specific departments within the Terminal are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analysis is conducted by a team of people with expertise in process operations, engineering, reliability and maintenance.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures based on a risk criteria.  The teams recommendations are reviewed with the appropriate management representatives and after concurrence, the recommendation list is distributed for follow-up and communicated to all affected employees. A copy of the final report is maintained in the Terminal main library and is available to all employees. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are assigned to individuals to develop action plans for resolution. The action plans are tracked to ensure that all items are completed in a timely manner.  Actions taken to resolve recommendations are reviewed and approved by management, and documented in a system maintained at the Terminal.  PHA's are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes (design, regulatory, etc.) that have taken place in the process since the last HAZOP analysis, as well as incidents in the process unit and in other similar units in the refining industry. The revalidation includes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation recommendations as done during the initial HAZOP analysis. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Terminal maintains written operating procedures addressing each Plant's operational processes including start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, planned s"

New operators must first successfully complete a comprehensive series of classroom training sessions on refinery operations.  The new operators are then paired up with more experienced operator to learn process specific procedures, duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) they have an adequate knowledge to perform the plant operating duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  The operator is then fully qualified upon completion of the Formal Operating Training Program requirements. In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures at least every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  All training is documented and kept on record in the Terminal's Training and Development Department.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe IES Kapolei Terminal uses contract personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily to perform maintenance work, including during shutdowns and construction projects.

Contractors working in the operating areas must attend a lengthier classroom training session that covers the same categories of topics but is geared towards hazards associated with work on or around the process equipment.  In addition, the classroom training covers specific facility safe work practices (e.g. permit to work, hot work, equipment isolation) and other related process hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Terminal also requires contractors to participate in key activates, such as tailgate meetings, safety and environmental audits, and work audits.  Requirements for each contractor are monitored by Terminal personnel who oversee each contracting company.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Terminal conducts a PSSR on new facilities and facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  The Terminal has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenanc"

These practices and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated, and training is provided to impacted employees. \n\n\n\nThe Terminal has specific support groups that specialize in the reliability of fixed equipment (e.g. piping, vessels) and rotating machinery (e.g. pumps, compressors).  These trained support personnel are responsible for performing inspections and tests to ensure safe equipment operations.  If safety or operational issues with equipment are identified, plans are developed to correct the deficiency. Members of these groups are also consulted when buying new equipment or machinery or when a design changes are being considered.        \n\n \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe IES Kapolei Terminal has safe work practices in place that help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include but are not limited to: 1) the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous work areas, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance, and 4) a permit procedure to control activities that maybe a source of ignition (i.e., hot work). These and other procedures, along with training of personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing con"

The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an \"authorization to implement and start up the change\".  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nPeriodic compliance audits are conducted at the Terminal to help ensure procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are effectively implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years with a Third party auditor. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are maintained at the Terminal.\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nTerminal processes have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention programs summarized in the previous section applies to the LPG operating unit which is the only covered process and PSM regulated process at the Terminal. The Blending and shipping (tank farm) is not covered by PSM or RMP guidelines. The B&S falls is guided by the general duty clause or the clean air act and IES utilizes the activities above whenever appropriate and feasible and applies them to the B&S area. Collectively these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and/or human error.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal also has safety features designed into process units to quickly detect, contain and control, and reduce/mitigate the co"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which has members from the local emergency response community, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and the fire department. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nEmergency response drills are conducted on a regular basis.  These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating \"what if\" situations that stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations. These drills can include outside agencies (e.g. LEPC, Honolulu Fire Department), and participants treat the hypothetical drill situations and respond accordingly. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the Terminal is a participating member of the Kapolei Local Emergency Action Network (K.L.E.A.N.).  This network's purpose is to promote emergency preparedness issues, including public safety and health in the Kapolei community including Campbell Industrial Park (CIP) where the Terminal is located.  The CIP Emergency Resources Guide is a vital resources produced by CLEAN.  The resources guide is used in conjunction with the refinery emergency plan in the event that notifications to neighboring businesses are necessary during a Terminal incident. \n\n\n\nPL"

      "SummaryText": "ANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the IES values, the Kapolei Terminal strives to continually improve its safety performance in order to protect people and the environment. Many of our most recent and future projects are designed and intended to ensure safe and reliable operation of the Terminal. Examples of some of the recent and future projects at the Kapolei Terminal include but are not limited to the following.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the Chevron Hawaii Refinery formed three new teams to further enhance piping integrity. Each team has been chartered to address opportunities with various on plot and off plot piping systems.   The areas of focus are: LPG piping systems, corrosion under insulation, and piping circuits susceptible to sulfidation corrosion. Work is expected to continue well into 2014 and possibly longer. While there are no longer dedicated teams as noted above, IES continues to focus on LPG piping systems and corrosion under insulation. With the sale of the refining assets, IES is no longer susceptible to sulfidation.\n\n\n\nAlso in 2013, the Chevron Hawaii Refinery constructed 4 new control houses to provide additional protection to unit operators from any potential consequences associated with hazardous chemical releases. These control houses are designed to withstand blast overpressures resulting from an explosion and provide safe haven in the event of a toxic chemical release. Additionally the Terminal has completed the relocation of the women's locker room to a location further away from the process units.\n\n\n\nTo further enhance the safety of the surrounding communities, the environment, and its employees, the Chevron Hawaii Refinery implemented a project to install independent high level indication and alarms on all LPG storage tanks and select atmospheric storage tanks throughout the facility to provide additional protection from liquid overfill events. IES will continue to evaluate tank needs for this additional protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
