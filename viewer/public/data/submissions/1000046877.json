      "SummaryText": "Objective:\n\n04/25/2016 - Submission of RMP correction to address the company name change,as of April 1ss, 2016, from LANXESS Corporation to ARLANXEO, USA LLC, Orange Site.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this RMP submission on 09/24/2015 is to update the LANXESS Corporation, Orange site RMP information in compliance with the EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Planning requirement to update the RMP data every five years. \n\n\n\nFacility:\n\nThe LANXESS Corporation Orange site is located in the industrial chemical road, Farm Road 1006 of Orange, Texas. The facility has four operating units, Cobalt Butadiene Rubber (CoBR), Lithium Butadiene Rubber (LiBR), EPR (Keltan) and Therban Rubber manufacturing units. The site produces three basic types of polymerized synthetic rubber with several grades and variations of each type.  These include two different types of polybutadiene rubber, ethylene propylene rubber and hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber. The rubber produced is fabricated by customers into consumer products such as tires, hoses, roofing membranes, timing belts and several automotive parts. The Utilities area of the plant supplies water, steam, electricity, compressed air, cooling water, potable water, process water and refrigeration for the polybutadiene production units.\n\n\n\nHydrocarbons are used as monomers and solvents in the units.  LANXESS Corporation Orange Plant inventories all the hydrocarbons used in the plant. There are five hydrocarbons solvents and monomers, and two chemicals that are used in quantities above the threshold quantities as defined in EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Planning regulation. The hydrocarbons are butadiene, 1-butene, propylene, butane and ethylene. The other chemicals are chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, which are primarily used in the Utilities department. \n\n\n\nThe LANXESS Corporation Orange, Texas site supports many outreach programs for the community including, the United Way, a Community Relations Committee, and an employee sponsored dive"

The facility maintains a RC/ISO 14001 standard.\n\n\n\nRecent Changes for Improvement: \n\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Polybutadiene rubber manufacturing unit, added rail cars to supply 1,3-Butadiene raw material to supplement the existing 1,3- Butadiene raw material supply by pipeline. The addition of rail cars increased 1,3-Butadiene quantity on site from 2,225,000 to 7,250,000 lbs.  However, the annual production of Polybutadiene rubber remained unchanged.  The rail cars are unloaded into the existing 1,3-Butadiene storage spheres. The project did not increase the tank farm storage facility and therefore, did not change the existing release scenarios documented in the site RMP. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety and Risk Management:  \n\nThe LANXESS Orange Plant is a PSM covered site, and is in compliance with the OSHA PSM Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Planning regulations.  All the manufacturing units comply with the fourteen PSM elements, and are considered to be Program Level III process under Risk Management Planning. The site PSM programs include:  \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nEmployee Training\n\nContractor Safety\n\nPre-Start Up Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSafe work Practices\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTrade Secrets\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \n\nRelease Prevention:\n\nHandling of hazardous materials undergoes a rigorous process hazard review.  Managing change across the plant has improved with updated procedures, incident and near hit reporting, preventive and corrective actions, and tracking of action items to closure.   \n\nMaintenance and improvement of Health, Safety and Environmental systems are ongoing at this facility and training takes place throughout the year.

All non-essential personnel are located away from potential areas for overpressure scenarios\n\n\n\nLeak Detection Systems:\n\nThe site maintains a third party on-site Leak Detection and Repairs (LDAR) program. Detected leaks are reported and necessary repairs are conducted to avoid major incidents. There are hydrocarbons detectors located throughout the site and are inspected and tested, at least once a year. In addition, emergency shut-off valves and excess flow check valves are installed in discharge lines of major vessels throughout the plant, and are periodically inspected and tested to avoid catastrophic releases. \n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History: \n\nLANXESS Orange site maintains exception safety and health record. All incidents and releases are documented and reported in an electronic system. The incidents are investigated and corrective actions developed, implemented and tracked to completion to prevent future occurrence. There have been no incidents or releases of off-site consequences at the LANXESS Corporation, Orange site in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: \n\nThe Orange site maintains a detailed emergency response plan. A trained emergency brigade and a hazardous material response team are maintained on site.  Disaster drills are conducted on site at least once a year and the site participates in local area drills.  In addition, the LANXESS Orange Plant participates in the Orange County Loc"
