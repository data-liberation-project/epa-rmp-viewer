      "SummaryText": "The Bearkat Processing Plant (\"Facility\") utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas liquids (NGL), where NGLs are extracted from the inlet gas using a cryogenic process and treated by a glycol dehydration unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution.  The Bearkat Processing Plant also includes an amine treatment system.  This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant is a new facility and has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  The Bearkat Processing Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant.  Therefore, the Bearkat Processing Plant is subject to Preventative Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10.  OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule.  All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant employs seven (7) full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \r\n\r\nThis Facility commenced operations in December 2014.  EnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink) last submitted a full RMP the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in October 2015 for the Bearkat Processing P"

      "SummaryText": "lant.  The current RMP is being submitted as a full 5-year update due to recent facility modifications and an updated Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) being completed. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL processing operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the NGL processing operations, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.    \r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of an NGL, propane, butane, or natural gas condensate release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Facility stores and processes the following RMP-regulated substances: NGL, propane, butane, and natural gas condensate.  NGL is a flammable mixture that contains n-butane, isobutane, isopentane, and n-pentane; propane is a flammable mixture that contains propane, n-butane, ethane, and propylene; butane is a flammable mixture that contains n-butane and isobutane; and natural gas condensate is a flammable mixture that contains ethane, propane, n-butane, and n-pentane.  \r\n\r\nThe following provides the maximum storage capacity and largest vessel capacity for all of the RMP-regulated flammables stored at the Bearkat Processing Plant.\r\n\r\nRMP STORAGE INVENTORY\r\n\r\nSubstance\t        \r\nPropane: Maximum Inventory 10,726 gallons/49,231 pounds; Largest vessel 4,065 gallons/18,658 pounds\r\nButane: Maximum Inventory 2,977 gallons/14,906 pounds; Largest vessel 2,977 gallons/14,906 pounds\r\nNatural Gas Liquids: Maximum Inventory 110,016 gallons/596,778 pounds; Largest vessel 32,190 gallons/174,613 pounds\r\nNatural Gas Condensate: Maximum Inventory 327,024 gallons/1,773,925 pounds; Largest vessel 42,869 gallons/232,541 pounds\r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant stores natural gas condensate, wh"

      "SummaryText": "ich under certain circumstances is not classified as a regulated flammable mixture.  Although the current facility Material Safety Data Sheet for natural gas condensate lists it as a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable, subsequent testing completed by EnLink demonstrates that the mixture would, at times, be considered an NFPA Class 4 flammable based upon the flash point and boiling point of the mixture.  As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gas condensate in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility.  \r\n\r\nThe substances stored at the Bearkat Processing Plant were also evaluated for toxic characteristics; it was determined that there are no RMP-regulated toxic substances handled at the Facility in quantities that exceed RMP threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of natural gas condensate.  As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM.  The Bearkat Processing Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation; \r\nProcess Safety Information; \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis; \r\nOperating Procedures; \r\nTraining; \r\nContractors; \r\nPre-startup Review; \r\nMechanical Integrity; \r\nHot Work Permits; \r\nManagement of Change; \r\nIncident Investigation; and\r\nCompliance Audits.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant has not had any RMP-reportable releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Emer"

      "SummaryText": "gency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule.  The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \r\n\r\nPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures; \r\nProper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \r\nEmergency response measures; \r\nProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \r\nEmployee training; and \r\nProgram review procedures. \r\n\r\nThe Bearkat Processing Plant maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) as described in 40 CFR 68.95 that provides guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained.  Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the EAP with the Glasscock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Garden City Volunteer Fire Department.  The Garden City Volunteer Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of natural gas condensate release.  \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM rule are included in the Bearkat Processing Plant's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.   \r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nEnLink has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.  The most recent PHA for the Facility was completed on April 30, 2019."
