A Management of Change document is routed to critical personnel to evaluate the change.  A Process Hazard Analysis may be be conducted if there are potential concerns, and resolutions must be completed prior to starting up the new process.  Process Safety Information such as relief valve calculations, procedures, etc. are also updated to ensure a safe design and operations.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review is also conducted to confirm equipment, procedures, instrumentation, etc. will ensure safe operations. \r\n\r\nDetails of our accident prevention efforts are contained in the Texas Operations General Operating Procedures, the Texas Operations Authorized Safe Practice Manual and the Standard Operating Procedures of each production unit.

Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nStationary Source Description\r\n\r\nEastman Chemical Company is a leading international chemical company that produces chemicals, fibers, and plastics.  Founded in 1920 in Kingsport, Tennessee, as a unit of Eastman Kodak Company, Eastman Chemical Company was spun off in 1994 and is now an independent, publicly held company traded on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol EMN).  Eastman has customers worldwide with annual sales greater than $10 billion.  With corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Eastman employs ~13,000 people in ~30 countries.\r\n\r\nEastman Chemical Company (Tyler Terminal Facility) is located on a 320-acre site in Smith County near Tyler, Texas.  The Tyler Terminal Facility receives butane, ethylene, propane and propylene by pipeline and truck and stores these materials in above-ground tanks and in underground caverns in a salt dome formation over 1,000 feet below the surface.  There are no chemical manufacturing operations at the Tyler Terminal Facility.  The materials received and stored at Tyler Terminal are sent by pipeline to the Texas Operations Longview site where they are used in the manufacture of over 40 different chemical intermediates, solvents, coatings, resins and plastics.  No consumer items are made directly at Texas Operations.  Instead, the Texas Operations products are supplied to industrial customers for use in the manufacture of hundreds of consumer items which enhance the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.  These products include automobile interiors, paints, tires, food preservatives, adhesives, furniture, cosmetics, pha"

It does not have any of the toxic substances listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.\r\n\r\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\r\n\r\nBasic Information:\r\n\r\nTexas Operations uses flammable gases and liquids in many of its operations.  Four examples of flammables handled and stored at the Tyler Terminal facility include ethylene, ethane, butane and propane.  All of the gases handled at the Tyler Terminal Facility are colorless gases with a mild petroleum type odor and all are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nUses:\r\n\r\nTexas Operations uses ethane, butane and propane as feedstock for the Texas Operations Longview site.  Ethylene is used by the Texas Operations Longview site as one of the basic building blocks for most of the other chemicals produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.
