      "SummaryText": "The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDuke Energy Progress, Mayo Electric Generating Plant is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Roxboro, North Carolina.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.  The SCR system is designed to inject ammonia diluted vapor into the plant flue gas and then pass the ammonia/flue gas mixture through a catalyst.  The catalyst causes a reaction that reduces NOx emissions in the flue gas, converting NOx into nitrogen gas and water.  The Mayo Plant stores the ammonia in two (2) 21,800 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The anhydrous ammonia in the storage tanks are liquefied under pressure.  The Plant uses administrative controls to limit the maximum volume of each tank to 17,099 gallons.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia used in the SCR system. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies and Programs\n\n\n\nThe Mayo Plant has established an Accident Prevention Program (APP) for the ammonia system that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA (Process Safety Management, PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA (Risk Management, RMP, 40 CFR 68). The station also maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). These plans have been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nAccident history, mitigating measures, and planned changes to improve safety \n\n\n\nThere have been no RMP incidents in the proceeding 5 years at the Mayo Plant. An initial HAZOP and subsequent revalidation have been conducted.  Opportunities to improve process safety were identified and implemented.  The system is equipped with interlocks and excess flow valves.  Emergency shutdown procedures are in place.  The ammonia storage tanks are located in a dike designed to contain 110% of the entire inventory of a single tank. "

      "SummaryText": "Mayo station is in the process of converting to aqueous ammonia in lieu of anhydrous ammonia to lessen the impacts to workers and the surrounding community in the event of a large release. \n\n\n\nMayo Station periodically reviews its Emergency Response Plan. The station participates in table-top exercises internally, and full-scale drills with outside responding agencies. Mayo Station has routine and scheduled mechanical integrity inspections and services in place to maintain equipment integrity. Mayo Station continues to drive employee engagement through quarterly engagement meetings with craft personnel and bimonthly management review meetings. \n\n"
