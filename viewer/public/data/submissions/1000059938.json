To this end, we have formal policies and procedures in our Emergency Response (Preparedness , Prevention, and Contingency) Plan.  This Risk Management Plan will be used as another program tool to further enhance this commitment.\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant was originally built in 1957.  It has undergone a number of changes in response to Federal EPA regulations (Clean Water Act) and State and local needs.  The facility was designed to process an average daily flow of 35 million gallons per day with a maximum of 90 million gallons per day.  It serves a population of Residential, Commercial, and Industrial customers numbering about 250,000.\n\n\n\nIn the process of treating the wastewater flowing through our facility, we use Chlorine to chlorinate the waste stream and Sulfur Dioxide to dechlorinate the waste stream before it is returned to the Mahoning River.  These are two of the Chemicals which are listed under the EPA's Risk Management Program Rules for which a Risk Management Plan needs to be developed.  At any one time we may have 24,000 pounds of Chlorine in one (1) ton containers on site.  The threshold quantity requiring a Plan is 2,500 pounds.  In addition, we may have 6,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide on site in one (1) ton containers.  The threshold quantity requiring a plan is 5,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe City of Youngstown's Waste Water Treatment Plant has in place a comprehensive safety, health, and environmetnal program.  We have adopted a very thorough Emergency Response Plan for our facility and have simulated a major chlorine release at our facility.  The City of Youngstown's Waste Water Treatment Plant coordinated this release simulation with the City of Youngstown's Fire Department, Police Department, and the Mahoning County Disaster Services Agency and the Emergency Systems were tested in October of 1997.

      "SummaryText": "n a review of our simulation, we updated our Emergency Response Programs and Systems.  We continuously monitor our hazardous materials with detection systems in our storage/use building.  These alarms are detected in our control room on the control panel and our operators can take immediate action to alleviate the potential release and activate our maintenance program to correct the malfunction. \n\n\n\nThe Waste Water Treatment Plant reviews its Emergency Response Program on a regular basis to be sure it contains necessary information to protect our employees and our neighbors.  Our plan includes names and phone numbers of Emergency Personnel and Agencies, including medical assistance.  We continue to provide this information in our Training Programs and drills as required. We have had one accidental release in the past five years. The release of 1,300 pounds occurred in May 2015, no one off site was injured, and approximately 100 individuals were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  We will continue to monitor and review our systems on a daily basis and be sure that our preventive maintenance programs continue to be used effectively and update as necessary."
