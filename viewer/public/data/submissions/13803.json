      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe management and employees of San Francisco Area Refinery at Avon are fully committed to a program of responsible management in all areas including health, environment and safety.  In fulfilling this commitment, management will ensure systems are in place to provide the resources and training to identify issues and maintain a safe and healthful environment as indicated by Company standards, accepted safety and environmental practices, and compliance with legislative requirements.  We will operate and maintain our plants, facilities and equipment and handle our raw materials and products in a manner to prevent personal injuries/illnesses, losses to Company property, releases to the environment, or impact to the communities in which we operate.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco San Francisco Area Refinery at Avon, located in Martinez, California, processes crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces gasoline, automotive diesel, propane, butane, fuel oil and petroleum coke.  In order to produce these products, we store and handle large quantities of flammable materials. \n\nCrude oils contain varying amounts of sulfur and nitrogen impurities.  If these compounds are not removed in the refining process, they produce air pollutants when consumers burn the fuel products.  Many of the processes at the Avon refinery are used to remove these sulfur and nitrogen impurities.\n\nSulfur impurities are removed and converted to elemental sulfur, sulfuric acid, and oleum (fuming sulfuric acid).  Elemental sulfur is sold for use in the manufacture of fertilizers and other industrial uses.  Sulfuric acid is used internally by the refinery as a catalyst.  Oleum is an industrial chemical that we transfer to an adjacent chemical plant for use in catalyst manufacture.  Our sulfur processing facilities produce intermediate products called hydrogen sulfide and sulfur d"

However, the Avon Refinery is required to report only for oleum, because we do not store hydrogen sulfide or sulfur dioxide in amounts exceeding the threshold quantities for these chemicals.\n\nNitrogen impurities are removed and converted to ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  The ammonia that we produce is mainly sold for use in the manufacture of fertilizers.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe EPA requires facilities to report on potential worst-case scenarios involving the regulated substances that we handle in amounts exceeding the threshold quantities.  The EPA mandates the release conditions for worst-case scenarios.  As a result, these scenarios ignore prevention programs that are designed to limit the number and size of chemical releases from our facility.  A toxic worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to be damaged such that it released its entire contents within ten minutes without accounting for response measures that we would take to minimize the impact of such a release.  A flammable worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to suddenly disappear, the contents were to instantaneously vaporize, and a resulting vapor cloud were to ignite and explode.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely event.  It is used to determine a reasonable outer bound for potential impacts in order to coordinate with local emergency responders.  Unlike the worst-case scenarios, our alternate release scenarios are based on actual equipment configurations.  In selecting our alternate release scenarios, we considered our practices and procedures for preventing and minimizing the size of chemical releases.\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Avon refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of our la"

We then store it in vessels designed for this purpose.  The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that releasing the entire contents of one of these vessels over a ten-minute period would result in significant offsite impact.  The ammonia toxic endpoint specified by EPA is 200 ppm (parts per million).\n\nThe alternate release scenario for ammonia is the complete failure of a 1-inch loading hose during ammonia transfer operations.  The ammonia release rate that would result from such a failure is much smaller than the rate specified by the EPA for the worst-case scenario -- about 2%.  The results of the alternate release scenario for ammonia indicate that such a release would have an offsite impact.\n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario for the Avon Refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of our largest butane storage vessel.  Butane is the material that is used in disposable lighters.  Like ammonia, butane is a gas at room temperature and the liquid form must be stored under pressure in vessels designed for this purpose.  The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that the instantaneous release and subsequent explosion of the entire contents of the vessel would result in offsite impact.  The endpoint specified by EPA for this type of release is an overpressure of 1 psi (pound per square inch).\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable materials is a pool fire that results from spilling and igniting the contents of a large refrigerated butane storage tank.  The resulting fire would give off intense heat.  Because of the location of the storage tank, the heat given off by the fire could reach beyond our fenceline to adjacent unpopulated land.  The toxic endpoint specified by EPA for this type of release is a radiant heat intensity of 5 kilowatts per square meter for a duration of 40 seconds.  This heat int"

This scenario represents a release from the oleum manufacturing process.  This results in the release of sulfur trioxide, which is the regulated substance contained in oleum.  The results of the alternate case scenario for oleum indicate that such a release could reach beyond our fenceline to adjacent unpopulated land.  The oleum toxic endpoint specified by EPA is 3.1 ppm.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Avon Refinery has experienced four accidental releases since June 1994 that qualify for reporting under the EPA's criteria .\n\nThe first event occurred on December 6, 1994.  This event involved release of regulated flammables that resulted in a fire.  There were no personnel injuries or known off-site impacts other than the visible smoke and flames resulting from the fire.  Investigation of the event revealed that a pipe in a process heater ruptured due to localized overheating.  The rupture released a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbons that immediately ignited.  The overheating was traced to a combination of blocked process flow through the pipe and uneven heat distribution that occurred during the heater startup.  As a result of the investigation, operating and maintenance procedures were modified to ensure process flow and provide even heat distribution during heater startup.\n\nThe second event occurred on January 21, 1997.  This event involved release of regulated flammables that resulted in an explosion and fire.  One Tosco employee was killed in the fire, and several other Tosco employees and contractors were injured as a result of the incident.  Off-site impacts were limited to the fire's visible smoke and flames.  Investigation of the event revealed that the outlet piping at a reactor ruptured due to high temperature caused by an uncontrolled reaction.

As a result of this incident, process controls were modified to automatically activate the emergency shutdown system in the event of excessive temperatures.\n\nThe third event occurred on August 6, 1997.  This event involved a release of a small amount of oleum that sprayed onto a Tosco employee.  As result, the employee received some second-degree burns that required medical attention.  Investigation of the event revealed a faulty gasket at a flanged pipe joint which was subsequently repaired.\n\nThe fourth event occurred on February 23, 1999.  This event involved a release of regulated flammables that resulted in a fire.  Although the fire was confined to limited area, one Tosco employee and three contractors were killed in the fire.  A second Tosco employee was seriously injured.  Investigation of the event revealed that a section of piping was removed without being properly isolated from the flammable materials contained in the process.  The flammable material was released and ignited by adjacent hot equipment.  As a result of this tragic accident, the Avon Refinery was shut down for a two-month period for re-training of refinery employees.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following summaries represent numerous prevention programs and practices at the Avon Refinery.  Avon Refinery employees are committed to operating a safe facility through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these programs and practices.  \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Avon Refinery encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.   Information on the refinery's prevention programs is available to employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  In addition, refinery managem"

This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams recommendations are then reviewed and with management personnel for resolution.  Implementation of actions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Actions implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe process hazard analysis for each process unit is updated and re-validated at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are reviewed with management personnel for resolution and any actions that result are tracked until they are completed.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Avon Refinery utilizes written procedures that address various phases of process operations including (1) initial startup of a newly constructed process, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) emergency shutdown.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent initial or refresher training of operators.  The procedures are managed by operating personnel and are updated as necessary to reflect changes and new information.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually to verify that they are current, updated, and accurate. \n\nOperating procedures and operating manuals are available in hard copy format in each process unit control room.\n\nOPERATOR TRAINING\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Avon"
