This is a new facility, with construction in still in progress,  and does not yet have ammonia on site.\r\n\u00a0\r\n The objective of the study was to identify potential catastrophic incidents by addressing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements for compliance PHAs.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe PHA was based on a generic study developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IARW). The generic study was customized and supplemented with unique site&#8209;specific issues to ensure that all hazards of this particular ammonia refrigeration system were thoroughly reviewed. This was done with a qualified PHA leader in a team format, centered around the What&#8209;If/Checklist technique.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA number of recommendations were made concerning items revealed during the study which are summarized the the attached  PHA Recommendation Summary\r\n\r\nRefrigeration System Basis of Design & Life Safety Systems Sequence of Operations:\r\n\r\nTHIS AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM AS INSTALLED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THESE PLANS IS OF THE CLOSED LOOP TWO STAGE - VAPOR COMPRESSION CYCLE TYPE WITH MAXIMUM DESIGN OPERATING PRESSURE OF 300 P.S.I.G.\r\n\r\nNOTE - THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS AUTOMATICALLY SEQUENCED & MONITORED INCLUDING THE AMMONIA LEAK DETECTION / NOTIFICATION CODE REQUIRED FUNCTION BY A PLC (PROCESS LOGIC CONTROLLER) BASED SYSTEM WITH:\r\nALARM / FAILURE NOTIFICATION FUNCTIONALITY & REMOTE ACCESS\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL POWER TO THE PLC CONTROLLER / AMMONIA DETECTION & NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IS SUPPLIED BY A DESIGNATED PRIMARY CIRCUIT BREAKER TO BE LOCKED ON WITH A 4 HOUR UN-INTERUPTABLE POWER SUPPLY (UPS) BATTERY BACK-UP IN THE EVENT PRIMARY ELECTRICAL POWER IS LOST.\r\n\r\nNORMAL SYSTEM OPERATION:\r\n1ST STAGE PRESSURE LEVEL:  LOW TEMPERATURE SUCTIO"
