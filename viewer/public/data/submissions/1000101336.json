The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, and the facility's Program level is 3.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\n\r\nThe top priority of SpartanNash is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, SpartanNash  has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, SpartanNash will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the Anne Arundel County LEPC/Anne Arundel Fire Company 4 - Severn Fire Station (Fire Dept.) to respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nSpartanNash is a foodservice distributor located in Severn, Maryland.
