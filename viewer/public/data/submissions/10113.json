This facility utilizes a circulating fluidized bed boiler that produces 785,000 pounds of steam per hour at 10000F, at a pressure of 2525 psi.  The electrical energy is supplied to General Public Utilities.\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia and propane, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  These substances meet the minimum requirements set forth in the EPA Risk Management Plan under the Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 112(r) and are covered processes under the act.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                      The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies:\n\nThe policy at the Colver Power Project is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own employees, contractor employees, and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafe operations of the processes which use anhydrous ammonia and propane depends on the manner in which we manage these substances, combined with the safety devices inherent in each process design, handling procedures, inspection procedures, maintenance procedures and the proper training of employees in all of the procedures.\n                                                                                                                                                                             \nThe Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used in oxides of nitrogen (Nox) control.

It is assumed that the entire 46,443 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released over a 10 minute period (4644 lbs./minute).  \n\nA distance to the end point was calculated at 3.88 miles using equation A-9 of Appendix 4A of the Waste Water Treatment Plant Guidance document.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint represents the maximum downward distance (direction-independent) that could be affected by a release.\n\nThis release will travel beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia--Alternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes a flashing liquid is released from a 3/16 inch diameter opening.  \n\nEquation 14 from the Waste Water Treatment Plant Guidance document was used to calculate a release rate of 66 lbs./minute through the hole.\n\nAn endpoint of 0.16 miles was calculated using equation A-9 of Appendix 4A of the Waste Water Treatment Plant guidance document.\n\nThis release will travel beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\nWorst-Case-Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s) for Propane:\n\nPropane -- Worst-Case-release Scenario\n\nWorst case release scenario for propane assumes 108,000 pounds of propane (25,500 gallons) is released instantaneously and detonated.  \n\nAs suggested in the RMP Guidance For Propane Storage Facilities document, the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint was calculated using equation C-1 of the Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance documents.  \n\nPer the EPA's guidance, a 10% yield was assumed.
