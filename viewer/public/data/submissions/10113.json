      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe Colver Power Project (CPP) is a 103.5-Megawatt MW (net) waste bituminous coal fired electric production facility.  This facility utilizes a circulating fluidized bed boiler that produces 785,000 pounds of steam per hour at 10000F, at a pressure of 2525 psi.  The electrical energy is supplied to General Public Utilities.\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia and propane, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  These substances meet the minimum requirements set forth in the EPA Risk Management Plan under the Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 112(r) and are covered processes under the act.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                      The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies:\n\nThe policy at the Colver Power Project is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own employees, contractor employees, and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafe operations of the processes which use anhydrous ammonia and propane depends on the manner in which we manage these substances, combined with the safety devices inherent in each process design, handling procedures, inspection procedures, maintenance procedures and the proper training of employees in all of the procedures.\n                                                                                                                                                                             \nThe Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used in oxides of nitrogen (Nox) control.  This process is referred to a Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR).   Nox are generated in the combustion chamber when waste coal is fired.  Oxides of nitrogen flow with other flue gases in the flue gas stream, o"

The Nox analyzer located on the stack, activates the anhydrous ammonia injection system via the Bailey DCS.    Injector ports located at the cyclone inlet inject anhydrous ammonia into the flue gas stream and reduces the amount of Nox emitted into the atmosphere.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a single above ground tank with a water capacity of 12,000 gallons.  The tank is located outdoors, 30 feet east of the baghouse.  \n\nFacility administrative controls limit the maximum storage capacity to no more than 75% which is equal to 46,443 pounds or (9000 gallons) of Anhydrous Ammonia. For reporting purposes this amount rounds to 46,400 pounds. \n\nTwo unmanned monitors (water cannons) are located strategically near the ammonia storage tank.  One is 100 feet southwest, the other 75 feet norteast.\n\nNote: The Worst Case Release and Alternative Release for Anhydrous Ammonia were based on the following:\n\nReference tables in OCA Guidance\nRMP Guidance for POTWs (Waste Water)\nLandView 3 Program\nUSGS Maps\n\nPropane\n\nPropane is used as a fuel source to supply propane vapor to the Coal Fluidized Bed (CFB) Start-Up Burners, the Fuel Drying System Burner, and the Limestone Prep Drying Systems.\n\nPropane is stored on site in three individual above ground tanks.  Each tanks has a 10,000-gallon water capacity.  The tanks are located outdoors, 70 feet east of the main baghouse.\n\nFacility administrative controls limit the maximum storage capacity for each tank to no more than 85%.  This equals 107,865 pounds (25,500 gallons) for each tank for each tank.  The total storage is equal to 323,595 pounds (76,500 gallons).  For reporting purposes this amount rounds to 324,000 pounds (77,000 gallons) of propane.  \n\nAll three propane tanks are protected by a water deluge system.\n        \nNote: The Worst Case Release and Alternative Release for Propane were based on the following: \n\nRef"
