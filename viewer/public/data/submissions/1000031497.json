This commitment is demonstrated through the development and utilization of the various risk management systems currently in place at the PRC.  These systems primarily focus on the prevention of any incident which may have adverse consequences to the PRC work force, surrounding community, or the environment.  Risk management systems that empha prevention of chemical spill or release incidents include:\r\n\r\n1.\tHazard Assessments\r\n2.\tProcess Hazard Analyses\r\n3.\tProcess Safety Procedures\r\n4.\tTraining\r\n5.\tMaintenance and Mechanical Integrity\r\n6.\tPre-Start Up Safety Reviews, and\r\n7.\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the PRC has developed a comprehensive Emergency Plan (EP).  The EP is a written plan that describes the emergency response system currently utilized at the PRC.  The system identifies specific roles and responsibilities of all personnel involved in the emergency response process.  These roles are identified for all organizational levels of the PRC, including management and emergency response teams.  The EP provides an outline of the organization and procedures to be utilized in response to any major emergency.  Such procedures are directly identified with and applicable to chemical release scenarios.  Periodic drills are conducted to evaluate and refine the EP systems and processes. These drills are often coordinated with local emergency response entities such as the Washington County LEPC, Jane Phillips Medical Center, and the Bartlesville Fire Department.\r\n\r\nTwo chemicals are currently stored and utilized in different processes at the PRC which exceed threshold quantities stipulated in EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.  These chemicals and the maximum amount stored of each are listed below:\r\n1.\tIsobutane\t66,528 lbs\r\n2.\tEthylene\t27,200 lbs\r\nIsobutane and ethylene"

The chemicals are presently being stored in the north tank storage area of the PRC.\r\nThe applicable worst case scenario for the PRC would be if the entire contents of the isobutane storage tank (filled to maximum allowable storage quantity) were to be instantaneously released and explode.  This scenario assumes complete compromise of containment by the tank and instantaneous release of the entire contents of isobutane.  Basically, it assumes the walls of the tank disappear and the contents of the tank explode.  This scenario does not consider any of the preventative controls that are in place.  The 1 psi overpressure of the explosion would extent 1,584 feet (or 0.3 miles) in all directions.  \r\nThe worst-case scenario for the ethylene process is identical to the isobutane scenario described above.  However, the affected area for the ethylene process is the smaller of the worst case scenarios of two processes. The 1 psi overpressure range for the ethylene process is 1,056 feet (or 0.2 miles) and does not reach any public receptors.\r\nThe RMP regulation uses 1 psi overpressure as the maximum allowable public exposure from a worst case scenario.  The closest public receptors to the north storage tank area are the Siemens Administration Building, Bartlesville Roundup Club Grounds, Bartlesville Airport Property (portion South of Highway 60), and the Phillips Gymnastics Center located to the north, west, west, and east of the PRC, respectively.  \r\nThe Bartlesville Roundup Club Grounds is not normally expected to have public receptors within the 1 psi overpressure radius of the worst-case scenario for isobutene; but a small portion of the property used seasonally falls within the affected area.  Due to the possibility of having public receptors in the area, a more feasible scenario must be calculated.  The alternative scenario involves isobutane being released at a rate of 10,000 pounds per minute due to a"
