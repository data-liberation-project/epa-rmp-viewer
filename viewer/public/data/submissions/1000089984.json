      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nWestlake Chemical Corporation, Natrium Facility\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nThe Westlake Natrium facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), applicable Federal and State Regulations, and applicable Coast Guard and Department of Transportation requirements.  All of these activities form an integral part of Westlake's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, which is to operate and maintain its facilities in compliance with all local, state, provincial, and national laws governing Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE). All Company operations shall be managed in a manner that protects employees, surrounding communities, the environment, and physical assets and strives for continuous improvement in our performance.\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe Natrium facility is part of the Chlor-Alkali business group of Westlake Chemical Corporation.  Natrium is a principle producer of chlorine, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and calcium hypochlorite.  Chlorine and sodium hydroxide are produced concurrently by the electrolysis of salt dissolved in water in either a mercury cell or diaphragm cell.  Chlorine is used in the purification of drinking water, wastewater treatment, and several household products and as a powerful disinfectant.  Chlorine is widely used in the manufacture of many synthetic chemicals such as chlorinated solvents, refrigerants, pesticides, synthetic rubber, and household cleaners.  The Natrium facility has three applicable RMP toxic chemicals including chlorine, anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nWorst-case and alternative case release scenarios\n\n\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for the largest quantities of flammable and toxic materials in the facility.  The Natrium facility has no RMP applicable flammable chemicals.  The guidelines and Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as per 40 CFR 68.25 were utilized in this process"

      "SummaryText": ".  Natrium used commercial software titled PHAST Professional, version 5.11, to determine off-site impacts from both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on dispersion modeling using PHAST 5.11 software and the EPA specified assumptions, off-site concentrations of chlorine would cause off-site impact.\n\n\n\nAlternative case release scenarios (ACRS) were developed for each of the listed chemicals in the facility.  These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used PHAST software to perform the end-point calculations.  The local emergency planning committee and office of emergency planning will utilize the ACRS information in conjunction with Westlake experts to develop emergency response plans, train responders, perform practice drills and maintain the appropriate equipment.\n\n\n\nThe ACRS for chlorine evaluated a scenario where a chlorine railcar is moved during loading and a loading line is ruptured.  The quantity released of 376 pounds would be limited by check valves and automatic shutoff valves.  No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe ACRS for anhydrous ammonia evaluated a scenario where a liquid ammonia unloading hose ruptures during truck unloading.  The amount of ammonia released of 300 pounds would be limited by process check valves and excess flow valves.  No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe ACRS for sulfur dioxide evaluated a scenario where a sulfur dioxide line develops a leak in a half inch line instrument fitting.  The operator would discover the leak on equipment rounds and isolate the leak.  The release rate would be 585 pounds over a 30 minute period.  No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nTrained personnel and envi"

      "SummaryText": "ronmental, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the Natrium facility operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards may include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as appropriate.  Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates.  Additionally Management of Change (MOC) procedures assure review of proposed changes and ensure that training needs are met.  Operators and foremen actively participate with engineers that lead process hazard analyses to review potential hazards and to recommend additional safeguards if needed.\n\n\n\nThe Natrium facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs to minimize equipment or piping failures.  Inspections of equipment are scheduled at a frequency related to the equipment condition, the severity of the service environment, the required reliability or the manufacturers recommended schedule.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function as intended if needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared imaging to detect differences in temperature, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists and a root-cause analysis program.  Piping systems are inspected and tested with X-rays and/or hydrostatic tests.  The piping is monitored by a variety of methods.  Training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to different types of equipment.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nThe Natrium facility has had thirteen recordable injuries associated with a release of an RMP applicable chemical in the last five years.  The incidents involved the release of chlorine and resulted in only minor inhalation injuries on-site. There were no injuries off-site but one incident resulted in off-site shelter in place and evacuations. \n\n\n\nEmergency response program\n\n\n\nThe Natrium facility maintains an Emergency Response Manual which addresses emergency planning and response.  The Natrium facility has a trained on-site Emergency Response Team that is HAZWOPER certified and available for around the clock response to emergency incidents, provide emergency medical attention, fight fires, control chemical releases, and initiate road blocks and/or public emergency procedures.  Additionally, Natrium participates in regularly scheduled meetings with a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) and emergency responders regarding emergency response for the community.  \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nWestlake is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations.  For further information, contact Mr. Jerry L. Mullens, Director-Operations-Region IV, Natrium Facility at (304) 455-2200.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Emergency Contact Person identified in section 1.8, Plant Security may be contacted at the same number provided at extension 3361.\n\n\n\nAdditional information about Westlake Chemical Corporation can also be obtained at our Westlake website located at www.westlake.com."
