If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nA) This facility is owned and operated by UAP Distribition, Inc., \n\nB) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is as a crop nutrient.\n\nC) The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the largest tank is approximately 46,750 pounds.  This represents filling the storage tank to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nA) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of the storage tank being released over a 10 minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 46,750 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest tank filled to 85% capacacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.7 miles.\n\nB) The alternate-case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity rel"
