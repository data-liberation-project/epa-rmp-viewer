Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Charter Oak Ag Supply are committed to the prevention  of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Crawford County LEPC, local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.  \n\n2.  Facility Information.                           \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for fertilizers for crop prodcution nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 300,000 pounds in our storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 miles (the most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/vales intervenes or remote manua"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles).\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Progam.\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowlege, has there been any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan.\n\n     The facility has:  \n\n     a.     A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; \n\n     b.     Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific implementation at this time."
