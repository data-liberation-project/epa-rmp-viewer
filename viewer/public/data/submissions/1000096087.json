Piramal Critical Care has implemented and maintains Standard Operating Procedures, Preventative Maintenance Plans, Spill Response, Emergency Action Plan, intended to reduce the likelihood of a hazardous release and to mitigate any release from the facility. \n\n\n\nAdministrative controls incorporate detailed, process specific standard operating procedures which include start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, safe operating parameters, consequences of deviations, hazard information, special safety precautions, emergency operations and emergency shutdown.  Piramal Critical Care provides training for all employees involved in process operations.\n\n\n\nAdditional administrative controls include the following written programs:  PPC Plan, On-Site Emergency Action Plan coordinated with the Northampton County Emergency Management Agency (LEPC), Hazard Communication, and Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).  These programs provide employees and responders with detailed instructions and information governing hazardous materials and emergency responses at the facility.  Piramal Critical Care provides initial and refresher training, drills where applicable, and confirmation of understanding relative to these written programs for all affected employees.\n\n\n\nEngineering controls include dedicated, hard piped material transfer systems, automatic fail-closed and redundant valves, overpressure burst disk protection with audible alarms, emergency stop systems, high and low level detection equipment with alarms and dedicated process vent and emergency air pollution control equipment.

      "SummaryText": " maintenance and equipment replacement are also conducted for facility processes.\n\n\n\nPiramal Critical Care is located at 3950 Schelden Circle in the Lehigh Valley Industrial Park IV.  The Industrial Park is located in the City of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in Hanover Township, Northampton County.  This facility manufactures and packages three pharmaceutical products, Isoflurane, Sevoflurane, and Desflurane.   To support manufacturing and packaging operations, there are also related laboratory, quality, logistics and maintenance activities.  \n\n\n\nThe site consists of 3.96 acres occupied by two buildings.  One houses the manufacturing, laboratory, maintenance, warehouse and office areas comprising 26,000 square feet with an attached 9,000 square foot outdoor concrete utility pad.  The utility pad houses the facility refrigeration equipment, raw material storage, HF and Chlorine delivery systems and air pollution control equipment.  The second building is a 22,000 ft2 warehouse and Packaging facility.   Approximately 60 percent of the property is occupied by the buildings and paved parking areas.  The balance of the property is covered by lawn and landscaping.   The facility/property is surrounded by industrial and non-industrial facilities.\n\n\n\nThe site stores and uses two hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantity - anhydrous hydrogen fluoride cylinders (max 5200 lbs) and liquid chlorine cylinders (max 48000 lbs* This limit while noted has not yet been realized due to physical storage limitations). There are no threshold quantities of flammable liquid materials stored or used anywhere at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Piramal Critical Care building is protected by supervised automatic sprinkler systems, emergency alarm pull stations which mobilize fire, police and Piramal Critical Care facility responders when activated.\n\n\n\n Piramal Critical Care maintains and adheres to specific, detailed handling and use instructions for operating processes which use these hazardous materi"

      "SummaryText": "als.  These instructions provide general accidental release prevention through both technological and management policies.  Key elements of the prevention program include limiting the quantities and use of these materials, inspection and leak testing prior to use, equipment maintenance, automatic and redundant valves, emergency stops and alarm systems.  The facility also maintains special equipment for managing cylinder emergencies.  Hazard assessments and risk analysis were conducted for the facility as it is subject to and compliant with OSHA's PSM rule relative to these hazardous materials.  Additional assessments were conducted for the facility Spill Prevention Plan and Emergency Action Plan.  These assessments aid the facility in identifying potentials for accidental releases and recommendations or corrective actions necessary to further reduce this potential.\n\n\n\nDuring the past five year period, there have been no releases of any materials above the reportable quantity (RQ).\n\n\n\nPiramal Critical Care has implemented and maintains two emergency response programs.  The Facility Emergency Response Plan is an on-site plan designed to aid in the management of a facility emergency.  The plan contains detailed information, employee responsibility and actions required, lines of authority and emergency contact information.  This plan sets specific guidelines for a variety of emergency contingencies and is rehearsed through unannounced drills.  As a part of this plan, the facility emergency alarm system automatically notifies police and fire personnel to respond when activated.  \n\n\n\nAs part of Piramal Critical Care's ongoing commitment, improvements in safety are a continuing process.  Piramal Critical Care encourages employee participation and recommendations for procedural, process and administrative improvements.  These recommendations are reviewed, revised if applicable, and implemented where a positive safety benefit exists.\n\n\n\nRecent and In-Process Safety Improveme"

      "SummaryText": "nts:\n\n\n\n1. The facility has recently replaced an aging emergency scrubber with a new Potassium Hydroxide based scrubbing solution scrubber. Unlike the old scrubber, which ran constantly, the new scrubber only turns on as needed.  Critical equipment is interlocked to the scrubber and will turn on the scrubber when either a Burst Disk Indicator is activated or if a sensor in the new Highly Hazardous Chemical Enclosure is activated.\n\n2. Historically the feed cylinders of Chlorine and Hydrogen Fluoride have been located outside.  A new Highly Hazardous Chemical Enclosure has been built and will be commissioned late Summer or early Fall 2021.  When commissioned all feed cylinders will be placed inside.  When running/feeding the interlocked doors will be closed.  The building is equipped with Chlorine and Hydrogen Fluoride sensors.  The feed lines (vaporizer lines) are equipped with 3 burst disks each with a burst disc indicator (BDI).  If a BDI is activated the emergency scrubber will turn on.  If a leak in the room triggers a sensor, the room ventilation system will turn off, a powered louvre will open at the same time the emergency scrubber turns on creating a negative pressure / sweep in the room. The scrubber is designed to scrub 2 full 1-ton cylinders.   The room is also equipped with light stacks at each entrance and inside to alert entrants/occupants of room conditions.  If a red light is on there will be no entry and all occupants must leave.  Required PPE will be donned when entering the building even in a Green light status.  Piramal is confident that this new isolation building will greatly enhance employee and community safety.  \n\n3. Upon completion of the Highly Hazardous Chemical Enclosure project, Piramal has partnered with a local college (Center for Business and Industry) to complete all Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs).  It is noted that some of the PHAs are beyond the 5-year review date.  This is based on the fact that the site is in the process of movin"
