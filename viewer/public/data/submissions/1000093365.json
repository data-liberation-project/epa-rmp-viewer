      "SummaryText": "The Dry Fork Station uses anhydrous ammonia to control NOx emissions from a 405 MW coal fired power plant.  The facility is located in a remote area of northeastern Wyoming approximately 7 miles from Gillette, WY.  The ammonia is delivered by truck and is offloaded and stored in two 57,500 lb horizontal bullets located outdoors.  The ammonia is stored as a liquid under its ambient vapor pressure and is pumped into the flue gas stream of the power plant boilers via a piping distribution system inside the plant.  The facility has implemented a RMP program which includes hazard assessment, prevention, and emergency response elements.  The prevention portion of the RMP is the same as required by OSHA's PSM Standard.  The facility is in full operation and there have been no ammonia releases from the facility to date.  The most recent compliance audit began in 2019 and will be completed in 2021.  Improvements will be provided by on-site personnel and other interested parties as reviewed by the Management of Change procedure.  The design of the facility and RMP-covered processes utilizes appropriate equipment and procedural safeguards that are typical for ammonia storage and transfer equipment."
