      "SummaryText": "Description of Facility and Regulated Substances\nThe facility  manufactures furnaces and air conditioning systems primarily for the home and manufactured housing industries.  The facility produces unit air conditioners and heat pumps in size from 1 1/2 to 5 ton capacity.  It is located in a primarily industrial area.  The regulated substance handled by the facility is the storage of propane in three 30,000 gallon propane tanks and related piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nWorst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the three 30,000 gallon propane tank with release of tank contents.  The alternative release scenario evaluated is a breakaway failure of hose utilized during the propane tank filling operation for one propane tank.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe facility has not had any accidents involving propane that have caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or shelterings in place.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and emergency Response Policies\nThis facility handles propane, which is considered a regulated flammable substance by EPA.  The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure.  To reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community it is our policy to develop policies in order to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations.  The facility's Emergency Response plan is nearly complete with the inclusion of written response procedures for an accidental release of propane including emergency health care.  Additional training of employees will follow the completion of the plan.  If an emergency occurs, it is our policy to contact the local fire department through the Sedgwick County Emergency Services (911) and request their response to the emergency."
