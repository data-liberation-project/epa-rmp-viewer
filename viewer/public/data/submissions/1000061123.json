The regulated RMP substance handled at this facility is butane. Using the Risk Management Program Guidance Table 2 conversion guidance, approximately 1,440,000 pounds of product has been calculated as the maximum inventory of butane.  For this location, butane is received via tank truck into twelve (12) 30,000 gallon butane tanks (horizontal units).  The facility also has other tanks (vertical) on site (23 ambient pressure petroleum liquids (diesel and gasoline)).  On occasion, some butane may be injected into one or more ambient pressure gasoline tanks on site as a RVP enhancer.\r\n\r\nGiven the flammable nature of butane and other liquids on site, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure at the site, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. In this regard, safety at the company's facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as ensuring safety device integrity is incorporated into the design of the butane tanks and their ancillary equipment. Furthermore, comprehensive training received by site employees upon hiring adds to the inherent safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Standards 40 CFR 68 / EPA CDX/FACILITY ID #100000230715 were developed by SCS Engineers in October 2015. In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release were to occur, the company operates in compliance with NFPA Code 30 (Fire Code for tank farms) and NFPA-58 (LPG gas code) in liaison with the Duval County Fire Department which helps to provide trained emergency response personnel that are knowledgeable on how to control and mitigate a release."

      "SummaryText": "The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAs stated above, the site receives, stores, and transfers butane which are blended with gasoline for octane enhancement. Butane arrives at the site via tank truck and is stored in twelve (12) 30,000 gallon storage tanks. \r\n\r\nThe worst case release was developed using RMPComp software. In this regard, the following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenario:\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for butane involves a catastrophic release from butane storage resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The scenario involves the release of 1,440,000 lb. of butane. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor that finds an ignition source. Assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an air temperature of 77 F, the maximum distance of 0.9 miles was obtained corresponding to a flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\r\nAn alternative butane release scenario resulting in a Vapor Cloud Fire involves a release from a six inch hole in the liquid space of a tank. In this scenario, 869 lb. of butane is released in 10 minutes with a tank pressure of 100 psi. The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include positive shutoff valves, excess flow valves, back flow check valves, and an emergency shutoff valve with mechanical, thermal, and remote capability. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention risk management requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA Code 30 and NFPA-58 and other applicable design codes in effect at the time of installation.\r\n\r\nThe following briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at t"

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nAs stated, Center Point conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rules that are implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. Incident Investigation Center Point promptly investigates incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of butane. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. Reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\nThe Center Point has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to the company's stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nA written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of butane is maintained on site. The plan includes emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The company's facility's emergency response plan is based in large party upon the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA '90). To ensure proper functioning, the company's emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes taking place within CPTC's processes that would require a modified emergency response. The local Fire Department is the Local Emergency Responder with which the company's emergency plan has been coordinated and verified."
