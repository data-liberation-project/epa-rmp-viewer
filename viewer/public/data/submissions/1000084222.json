      "SummaryText": "The Exfluor Research Corporation facility in Round Rock, TX is the headquarters and manufacturing site for two specialty perfluorocarbon synthesis companies (Exfluor Research Corporation and FluoroMed L.P.). Both entities utilize an on-site fluorine production process to perform direct fluorination chemistry for pharmaceutical, industrial, academia, defense, environmental, and R&D applications. The fluorine production process is operated by Exfluor Research Corporation for usage by both companies. HF is currently the only OSHA PSM and EPA Risk Management Program regulated substance at the facility that exceeds the threshold quantity. Exfluor purchases, stores, and uses 99% Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) in DOT compliant 90-pound cylinders. The 90-pound cylinders are connected and disconnected from the process, as needed, to facilitate electrolytic production of fluorine and hydrogen. The process produces fluorine on an as-needed basis to facilitate the direct fluorination processes. This is done to prevent excess fluorine storage requirements. The hydrogen that is produced as a by-product of this reaction is utilized by on-site thermal oxidizers for emissions abatement. The fluorine production process consists of 12 electrolytic fluorine production cells that are spread out amongst two buildings on the campus, three are in the front building (Building 1) and nine are in the rear building (Building 2). The processes are nearly identical and are governed by the same Process Safety Management. Exfluor currently has 90 DOT inspected and approved 90-pound cylinders in circulation either in storage, empty and in transit to the vendor, full and in transit from the vendor, or connected via the HF feed manifold in either building. Only five HF cylinders are manifolded together, at one time, never exceeding 450 pounds.\n\nA variety of engineering controls are utilized to prevent and/or minimize the release of HF. Each HF cylinder in storage and/or transit is visually inspecte"

      "SummaryText": "d and the DOT date stamp is inspected prior to any movement of the cylinder. The cylinder valves are thoroughly inspected and tested prior to installation on each cylinder. The cylinder valves are also visually inspected prior to handling any cylinder for utilization or transit. Each valve is also capped with a stainless steel CGA cap with a calcium impregnated Teflon seal that is specially designed and formulated for HF service. Each cylinder is also equipped with the proper manufacturer provided bump cap while they are in storage and/or transit. All cylinders, at all times, are properly secured via a stationary chain or the heavy-duty ratchet strap on the storage and transit rack. When connected to the HF feed manifold, HF is released in a controlled manner, as needed by the process, via a controlled heater process. Each cylinder has an independent heater that is activated in a process-controlled manner to only provide the necessary amount of HF needed for the process. The HF pressure is monitored continuously with a pressure transducer that is capable of stopping the process immediately during any adverse pressure incidents. There is also an analog gauge on the manifold that can be visually inspected by properly trained technicians/operators to analyze the operating pressures of the HF. All HF feed manifold valves, tubing, and any other conveyance components are visually inspected daily by the technician/operator. HF monitors are strategically placed throughout the facility that can detect and will immediately stop the process for any HF detected at 5 ppm or higher. These HF monitors are calibrated every six months. If either the pressure transducer detects an adverse pressure event or an HF monitor reading is in excess of 5 ppm, the on-site process control system will telephonically notify key members of the Emergency Contact List in support of the facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan (Emergency Response Program).\n\nThe facility has a robust Emergency Action Plan and"

The EAP has designated, by name, response positions for certain critical employees with specific training and experience for their assigned duties and roles. The EAP addresses a variety of emergencies and appropriate response operations to minimize the impacts on the employees, the environment, the community, and the facility. The facility also has HAZWOPER capability with fully trained personnel with the necessary equipment to respond to nearly any incident that may occur at the facility. The facility is an active participant in the Williamson County LEPC, with key members of the response team attending regular meetings and coordination events. The critical information of the facility and Tier II information is shared annually with the LEPC and the local (responding) fire department. Notification exercises are conducted regularly, and the first tabletop exercise for the facility is planned to occur prior to December 2025.\n\nThere have been no significant accidental releases of the regulated substance (HF) in the last five years that meets the criteria specified in 40 CFR \u00a7 68.42 \u0096 Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere are multiple planned activities that will be conducted in the next 2-year period to improve the safety of the facility and facilitate a more robust response in the event of an incident. The facility is currently active within the LEPC, and the facility will request assistance from the LEPC in conducting and/or participating in a table-top exercise that simulates the release of a PSM and RMP regulated substance. The current EAP will also be shared with other potential responding entities that are active participants within the LEPC for feedback and to share general information to facilitate a response."
