E. Ham WWTP is an extended aeration wastewater facility with the design capacity of 2.4 MGD. Chlorine is utilized to disinfect the effluent. Sulfur dioxide is then used to remove any chlorine residual before discharge. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide is stored in the chlorine building in ton cylinders. To minimize the risk of accidental release, inventories are kept at a minimum. Safety equipment includes a leak detector, self-contained air packs and an emergency repair kit for ton cylinders. Chlorine in 150 lb. cylinders is also stored at the facility for use at the Valleyview WWTP, Fairmont WWTP and three local wells.\n\n7 Worst Case Scenario The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios as required by the EPA. The worst case scenario was developed using EPA's RMP.COMP VER 1.06. The worst case scenario assumes the rupture of a ton container at the facility. This would mean the release of 110 lb./min. EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, winds speed of 1.5 m/sec, were used. The process being enclosed would be a passive mitigating circumstance that would have the affect of partially containing the leak and limiting the area affected. Using EPA mandated atmospheric conditions and taking into consideration mitigating conditions, an end point for chlorine contamination has been determined to be 2.2 miles. The estimated residential population affected would be 3200 people or 1200 households. \n\n7 The Alternative scenario This scenario also uses EPA's RMP.COMP VER 1.06. The alternate scenario is defined as a more likely scenario. This involves tube failure, bad connectio"

Passive mitigating circumstances would be an enclosed process, which would partially contain the leak and reduce the area affected. The max. Avg. sustained release rate would = 10.5 lb./min for 60 minutes. EPA mandated atmospheric conditions, namely stability factor of D and a wind speed of 3 m/sec were used in this model. Using EPA mandated atmospheric conditions and taking into consideration passive mitigating conditions, the end point for chlorine contamination has been determined to be .1 mile. The estimated population in the affected area is 30 people or 10 households. \n\n7 Five Year Accidental History  The J. E. Ham WWTP has had no accidental releases of any regulated chemicals for the previous five year.\n\n\n\n\n7 Accidental Release Response Program The accidental response program for the     J. E. Ham WWTP falls under the jurisdiction of the (SEOP) Sylacauga Emergency Operating Procedure. The SEOP is a coordinated effort between local authorities to respond to manmade and natural disasters. The Utilities Board and local authorities have developed procedures to contain and control any accidental release of chlorine. Local authorities includes the following:\n\n1. Fire Dept.\n2. Police Dept.\n3. Coosa Valley Rescue Squad\n4. Emergency Medical Services \n\nUnder the accidental release response program, standard procedures have been established to alert the local authorities should a serious leak occur. Evacuation of the affected areas will be implemented while designated personnel control and contain leaks. The Police dept. and Fire Dept will be responsible for public notification and evacuation of effected areas.\n\n7 The accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:\n\n1. High level of training for the operators\n2. Preventive maintenance programs\n3. Use of safety equipment\n4. Use of operating procedures\n5. Performance of a hazard review of equipm"
