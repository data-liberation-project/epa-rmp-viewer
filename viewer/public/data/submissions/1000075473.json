Croda takes its commitment to Process Safety seriously and demonstrates this with the investment of capital funds for safety improvements, such as the relocation of the EO rail car unloading to a remote area of the facility, installation of a safety instrumented system for EO storage, upgrades to relief valves, and for implementation of various PHA action items. Croda has rigorous programs in place for key elements of PSM, such as hazard assessment and management of change.\n\n\n\nCroda utilizes many systems to control their process.  Some systems include one or more of the following:  vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, oxidizers, manual shut-off valves, automatic shut-off valves, interlocks, excess flow valves, rupture disks, alarms, and procedures.\n\n\n\nCroda utilizes systems to mitigate the consequences.  Some systems include one or more of the following: dikes, enclosures, sprinkler systems, and deluge systems.  In addition, Croda has implemented other elements of the Prevention Program, and reviews these elements regularly for continuous improvement. These elements include:  \n\n\n\n- Training\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Compliance Audits (most recently in November 2016)\n\n- Accident Investigations\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Safe Work Practices\n\n- Contractor Safety\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Croda, Inc. facility in Mill Hall, PA maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public "
