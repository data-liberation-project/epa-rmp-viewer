      "SummaryText": "WEST MORGAN-EAST LAWRENCE WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Treatment Plant is a publicly owned water clarification facility that is operated and maintained by the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Authority.  The plant is located adjacent to the Tennessee River in Hillsboro, Alabama, on the northern border of Lawrence County.\n\nWater is treated for a variety of purposes, including removal of pathogenic microorganisms, tastes and odors, color and turbidity, dissolved minerals, and harmful organic materials.  The treatment process includes physical and chemical methods, both of which determine the quality of the finished water.\n\nWater contains many microorganisms, some of which cause disease.  The possibility exists that some of these microorganisms might pass through the treatment plant or might enter the water after treatment.  The destruction of pathogenic bacteria in water has always been of primary concern in the treatment of potable water.  For this reason, public water supplies in the United States and most of the world are treated with disinfectants to provide additional protection against transmission of disease.  Chlorine, in a variety of chemical forms, has been the disinfectant most commonly used in the United States, while chlorine gas in the most commonly used form of chlorine.  Chlorine is a powerful oxidizing agent that is easy to use, inexpensive, and reliable.  A principle advantage of chlorination over other forms of disinfection is that a chlorine residual is created that can protect the treated water after leaving the treatment plant, allowing for a lower total of volume of disinfectant required.  \n\nChlorine is shipped, in liquid form, in pressurized steel cylinders ranging in size from 100 pounds to one ton.  It is recommended that treatment facilities keep an adequate reserve of chlorine for disinfection so that public service can be maintained regardless of equipment servicing or maintenance requirements.

      "SummaryText": "-East Lawrence Water Treatment Plant keeps six ton-cylinder vessels of chlorine in storage at any given time, or the equivalent of 12,000 pounds.  \n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas that has a suffocating odor, and is slightly soluble in water.  The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that acute exposure to high levels of chlorine in humans can result in chest pain, edema, and, in extreme cases, death.  At a lower level, chlorine is a potential irritant to the eyes, upper respiratory tract, and lungs.  In addition to these human concerns, the moist gas is also corrosive, therefore chlorine, chlorinators, and piping carrying gaseous chlorine under pressure are located in a separate room in the plant.  Positive ventilation to the outside air is provided, with an outlet near the floor since chlorine is heavier than air.  An automatic chlorine detector connected to an alarm is also utilized.  Implementing these and other safety measures, the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Treatment Plant has not had one accidental release of chlorine since its inception, while maintaining round-the-clock operation to provide the public with the highest quality water available.\n\nShould an emergency situation ever arise as a result of a catastrophic chlorine gas release, computer models (RMPComp)provided by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that in a worst-case scenario (quantity released is maximum capacity of largest vessel), gas dispersion could occur anywhere in an approximate three mile radius around the plant.  This radius is based on assumptions made by conservative calculations and estimations, such as wind speed, atmospheric conditions, terrain, amount of chemical released, etc., and could be considerably less under normal circumstances.  Although such an event is highly unlikely and unusual, especially with any off-site consequences, it is in the best interest of all those involved in both the plant and surrounding community to consider and plan for an em"

Such an emergency plan can also be effective in illustrating to the public the vast steps already taken by the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Treatment Plant in their continuous evaluation of and improvements to safety and protection of human health and the surrounding environment.  The West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Treatment Plant will also continuously search for ways to help its employees improve their safety performance, continue its coordination with local emergency responders, and utilize updated training methods, thus continuously reducing any risk to society from the release of this critically important chemical.      \n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been prepared specifically for the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water Treatment Plant in accordance with OSHA standard 191.38.  It has been developed as a part of the Risk Management Program to provide a planned and organized response to a major or catastrophic chlorine gas release.  The ERP will also serve as a site specific action plan in the event of fire, accidental injury, or any other emergency that may require the assistance of Emergency Responder Units.  This plan applies to any and all emergencies that could be reasonably expected in the workplace, and is written primarily for plant employees, in that after notification is given to the local emergency management authorities, further actions required would be indicated under the appropriate response plan of the associated agencies involved.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN COORDINATORS\n\nThe ERP coordinators are as follows:\n\n                                                      Home Phone      Pager                  Mobile Phone\n\nStanley Self - Plant Op.
