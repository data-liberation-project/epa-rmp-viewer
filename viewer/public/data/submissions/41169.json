Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Incorporated is stongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is illustrated through the implemetation of a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. is continually establishing and revising corporate policies to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances into the surrounding communities and natural environments.  Highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. is classified as a secondary aluminum smelter whose primary activities encompass the melting and refining of scrap aluminum to produce aluminum ingot via direct chill methods; rolling ingots into aluminum rolls/products, and; performing coil coating processes on aluminum rolls.  This facility has one (1) regulated substance, chlorine, present above the specified threshold quantities as stipulated in 40 CFR 68.  This regualted substance is utilized in the degassing and refining processes of molten aluminum in the Casting Mutual Recoginition Units (MRU).\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine (ten ? 750 pound cylinders ? 7500 pounds) that can be effected at Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. resides in a remote location found in the South Casting MRU.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up t"

      "SummaryText": "ables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the South Casting MRU Chlorine Storage and Delivery System.  The scenario involves the release of 8000 pounds of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) wind speed, the maximum distance of 9.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l).\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorine Storage and Delivery System of the South Cast House.  The scenario involves the release of 450.00 pounds of Chlorine in a gaseous form over a period of thirty minutes.  Passive  mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  In addition, the release is assumed to be controlled by an active mitigation measure, which include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.38 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific  \nPrevention Steps\n\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68, which are also governed under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) as delineated by 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the notification  requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Current process quantities are below the Process Safety Management requirements.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include ?what-if,? ?check-lists,? and a combination thereof.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after an outage.  The information is regularly reveiwed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures asssociated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Commonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCommonwealth Aluminum Lewisport, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
