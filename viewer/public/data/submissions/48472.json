However, the facility is not used for treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.  Therefore, the Miami Plant is presently covered under OSHA\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan 29 CFR 1910.38(a), OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q), and EPA\u00bfs  RMP Emergency Response rule 40 CFR 68.95.

Selected operations and maintenance employees receive first responder operations level training and Miami Plant management receives on-scene incident commander training that meets the regulatory training requirements of HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120(q), and EAP 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Both groups receive annual refresher training that is coordinated using a site-specific Incident Command System (ICS).
