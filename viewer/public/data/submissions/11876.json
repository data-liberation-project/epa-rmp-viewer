This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR part 68).\n\n\n2.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE     POLICIES\n\nThe National Cooperative Refinery Association, McPherson, Kansas, Conway Underground Storage has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n3.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED     SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Conway Underground Storage facility provides storage for approximately 4,000,000 barrels of petroleum products including propane, natural gas, butane, gasoline, and intermediate refinery feed stocks. The underground salt layer caverns average about 50,000 barrels capacity each. Pipelines are used to transfer products to and from the refinery and to various product terminals. \n\nThe Conway Underground Storage has four EPA listed flammable substances held above the threshold quantity. These are propane, Alky olefin feed, butane and isobutane.  \n\n\n4.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nTOXIC SUBSTANCE SCENARIOS\nThe Conway Underground Storage does not store or use EPA listed toxic chemicals.\n\nFLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE SCENARIOS\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for a flammable substance release from this facility involves a 10 minute release of 86,200 pounds of butane from  the # 15 underground storage cavern and subsequent vapor cloud explosion (VCE).

      "SummaryText": "fsite Consequence Analysis Guidance/RMP Comp. were used to calculate release distances. Butane storage was selected because the butane is transferred to Conway for underground storage and then transferred back to the refinery for further processing. Butane is transferred more often than the olefin feed.\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the overfilling of # 15 butane cavern causing a release of butane to the brine ponds.  This scenario assumes the release would last thirty five minutes until valves were closed and then a subsequent vapor cloud explosion occurred. EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance/RMP Comp was used to calculate release distances.\n\n\n5.0  PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at Conway Underground Storage.  Because the process at the Conway Underground Storage is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation (National Cooperative Refinery Association; PSM, Doc. 8502)\nConway Underground Storage encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Conway Underground Storage has one employee representative in the position of Special Project Operator. This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedures, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between Conway operators and management. Other examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating in the Union/Management Health and Safety Committee and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (Process Hazard Analysis) team. Employees have access to all information cre"

The employee participation policy is maintained at the National Cooperative Refinery Association Environment, Health & Safety Department, 1391 Iron Horse Road, McPherson, Kansas. It addresses each accident prevention program element. \n\nProcess Safety Information (National Cooperative Refinery Association Refinery; PSM, Doc. 8503)\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of Conway Underground Storage. These documents address inventory maximums and safe limits for pressures and flows of transfer pumps. Up to date information is maintained by the Conway Operators.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association also maintains numerous mechanical documents that provide information about the design and construction of Conway Underground Storage equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nThis information is available through the National Cooperative Refinery Association engineering department. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (National Cooperative Refinery Association; PSM, Doc. 8504)\nConway Underground Storage has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the underground storage are identified and controlled. Within this program, areas are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association p"

      "SummaryText": "rimarily uses the \"What If\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The \"What If\" technique asks a series of questions to review potential hazard scenarios and possible consequences. This analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the underground storage as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to Process Hazard Analysis findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, National Cooperative Refinery Association periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures (National Cooperative Refinery Association; PSM, Doc. 8505)\nConway Underground Storage maintains written procedures that address operations needed for the storage and transfer of refinery products. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in underground storage operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In\naddition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors (National Cooperative Refinery Association; PSM, Doc. 8507)\nNational Cooperative Refinery Association uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near underground storage equipment, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform Conway personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
