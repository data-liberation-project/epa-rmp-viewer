The CS Metals facility is located in Convent, LA on Highway 3214.  The facility will begin operation in May of 2000 and will employ approximately 60 full-time employees.\n\nCS Metals views environmental and safety issues as a top priority and has dedicated resources to safety, health, and environmental programs.  These programs are designed with a focus on accident prevention to CS Metals employees, neighbors, and the environment through the use of properly prepared and implemented safety procedures, operating procedures, inspection procedures, and training.  These proactive measures also include periodic reviews, documentation of changes, and investigative steps to allow maximum protection of health, safety, and environmental concerns.   \n\nCS Metals manufactures specialty metal products such as vanadium and molybdenum primarily from used refinery catalysts.  In order to properly manufacture these products, the Convent Facility uses anhydrous ammonia, which is stored in a single 20,000 gallon tank.  CS Metals uses ammonia as a crystallizing agent for the specialty metals.  The ammonia is recovered in the process through the use of scrubbing technology.  \n\nCS Metals has taken many precautions to prevent a release of this chemical from its facility and has invested significant amounts of time, capital, and planning to implement important safety precautions.  These precautions include specific engineering design of equipment, use of pressure relief valves, standard operating procedures (SOP's), employee training, routine maintenance checks, and inspections.  Pressure relief valves are in place to prevent failure of equipment integrity should pressure in equipment exceed normal operating ranges.  The various procedures, training, maintenance checks, and inspections are strictly enforced to provide assurance that the equipment and process are"

Logs are kept for inspections and maintenance checks for review and planned action items for potential problems as additional preventative measures.                  \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nCS Metals has performed an off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case scenario as defined by EPA.  For this worst case scenario, it was assumed that the maximum capacity of the ammonia storage tank (20,000 gallons) would empty in 10 minutes assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, F class stability, and a temperature of 77\u00b0 F.  As a result of such a scenario, the potential off-site radius was estimated at 4.7 miles to the EPA defined toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.   This distance was calculated by the EPA software program RMP*Comp, which uses the RMP consequence analysis procedures recommended by the EPA.  \n\nThis EPA consequence and procedure are quite conservative in its assumptions in order to maximize the potential distance in the radius for emergency planning purposes.  The likelihood of ammonia traveling this distance off-site is nearly impossible since, at the very least, this distance does not account for the process controls and safety measures in place at the Convent Facility.  For instance, CS Metals has operating procedures and administrative controls in place to prevent an ammonia release of the size required to be considered by the RMP rule.  The tank is operated at less than half of its design pressure and temperature in order to provide substantially more protection against potential mechanical failure of the tank.  In addition, administrative controls require that the ammonia storage tank is kept at only 85% of the tank capacity. Should the pressure in the tank rise above safe operating levels, the tank is equipped with two process safety valves which would provide a smaller and much more controlled release, should such be necessary.    \n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnate case scenario assumes that a \u00be inch valve on the discharge from the ammonia storage tank accidentally remains open for 60 minutes.  This scenario was chosen as a conservative possibility and accounts for human error.  The distance calculated by RMP*Comp for the alternate scenario was 0.2 miles before reaching the toxic endpoint of .14 mg/l.  The calculation assumes a wind speed of 3 meters/second, D class stability, and a temperature of 77\u00b0 F.  This is a conservative estimation of the endpoint distance because the calculation also does not account for any passive or active mitigation measures.  Also, sixty minutes is a long amount of time for a valve to be open without being noticed and corrected to stop the discharge.  Written operating procedures, skilled operators, and routine equipment monitoring minimizes the chance of such an incident from occurring.  However, even if such an incident was to occur and the ammonia was to reach 0.2 miles, the impact to the public or environment would be minimal.  This is because this distance is just beyond property boundaries, a long and safe distance from residences, public receptors, or environmental receptors.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program at CS Metals\n\nCS Metals complies with all of the Program 3 Prevention Program Requirements as defined in the RMP rule.  This includes an on-going program to maintain process safety information, current process hazard analyses, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change programs, and training.  In addition, CS Metals utilizes pre-startup safety reviews, compliance audits, and incident investigations to communicate and provide the opportunity for improvements when warranted.  Use of hot work permits and a mandatory contractor safety plan is also part of the CS Metals Accidental Release Prevention Plan.  Each of these areas is discussed further below:\n\nA.
