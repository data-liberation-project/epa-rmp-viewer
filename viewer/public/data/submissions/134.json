      "SummaryText": "Morning Star Fertilizer is a retail agriculture fertilizer outlet, servicing farmers in the Carroll County, Indiana area.\nOur commitment to safety for our employees and the community is at the upmost importance. We meet or exceed state and federal regulations concerning our business by diking, liquid load out pads, and safety controls througout the systems. \nOur primary activity is to supply farmers with fertilizer for their crops. We handle dry, liquid, and anhydrous ammonia fertilizers.\nIn a worst-case scenario, offsite targets could be impacted. Safety valves are located within the system to minimize releases. \nOur business is regulated by the Indiana Office of the State Chemist, with regular checks conducted by their office at our location.\nWe have had 1 accidental release in the past 5 years, releasing approximately 2000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia at a offsite location. There were no injuries, but locations were evacuated for safety reasons. We have a written response program that is updated on a regular basis, to keep up with changes in our business, and have regular training with our employees, and local emergency response personel to keep refreshed on emergency situations in case they would arise."
