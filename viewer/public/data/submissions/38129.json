Simplot Co. to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Unit Director has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions. \n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Boiler and Refrigeration Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSimplot's Othello, WA facility produces frozen potato products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 87,600 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Othello facility.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia related incidents at the Othello facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Othello facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n- Fire Plan\n- Ammonia Leak Procedures\n- Evacuation Procedures\n- Responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeration system was re-analyzed in 2004.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented as required.  \n\nFire Drill and Critique program initiated in 2004.  The purpose of this plan is to adequately prepare J.R.
