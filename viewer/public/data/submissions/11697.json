This facility is located at 901 Brunner Street in Peru, Illinois, and is generally located along the North Bank of the Illinois River.  This facility is classified as a Program 2 due to the use of one ton liquid chlorine cylinders at the plant.  This would be considered a simple stationary source and the facility is publicly owned in the State of Illinois which does not have a delegated OSHA program.\n\nThe person responsible for Part 68 (RMP) implementation and also the contact person is Mr. Tim A. Perra who is the City of Peru Certified Operator in Responsible Charge.  There are five other employees that work at this site.  The worst case scenerio and alternative release have been calculated and the worse case would extend 1.3 miles and could possible affect 20,000 people.\n\nThere have been no accidents related to chlorine discharge in Mr. Perra's 18 years of operation of the Peru facility.\n\nThe Peru Prevention Plan is based upon the original Plant and Operation Maintenance Manual.  Chlorine training is given at least once per year.\n\nThe City of Peru is a member of the LaSalle County LEPC and the Peru Civil Defense; and the Fire and Police Departments would also be utilized in case of an emergency."
