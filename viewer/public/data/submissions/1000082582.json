Our belief in environmental stewardship is revealed in our policies and demonstrated through our actions. Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Although such releases may not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response personnel at the Seattle Fire Department to control and mitigate the effects of any release should they occur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\r\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is used as a\r\nrefrigerant to support our process. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA, PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA, Section 302 notification requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\r\nstationary source:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLineage-Seattle SeaFreeze maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with"

The Emergency Action Plan in place prepares for emergency evacuations, to provide first aid and medical treatment and to contact federal, state and local officials in the event of a major release of ammonia.\r\nThe plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe King County LEPC, Office of Emergency Management is the local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\r\nwith which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAll recommendations that were generated by the 2017 PHA are being addressed.\r\nAny new equipment installed in the future will incorporate new safety design and technology available at the\r\ntime of installation.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and\r\nprocess operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of three years or sooner if required by the\r\nregulation. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lineage -Tacoma maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nLineage-Seattle SeaFreeze has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
