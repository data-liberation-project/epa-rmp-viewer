Activities conducted in the preparation of\nthis report included, but were not limited to, review of original registration information,\nverification of longitude and latitude using U. S. Geological Survery information, Worst\nCase & Alternative Case release scenarios using EPA RMPComp software, population\nestimation using Landview data, review of the most recent 5-year accident history records,\nand complete review of all original RMP/PHA documentation from June 1999. A modified\nversion of the procedures used to develop the original RMP were followed to prepare this\nupdate.\nAll procedures, plans, and recommendations from the original 1999 RMP and 2004 Update  were reviewed and verified. With minor updates, it was determined that the Fowler Packing operating\nprocedures, accident prevention plan, and emergency response plan are current, still\neffective, and complete. This facility has undergone several expansions since 1999. Where necessary the original RMP information has been corrected or appended to update the risk management program with changes to information, lists,\nand contacts during the subsequent period since initial implementation.\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases from this facility during the past 5-year\nperiod covered by the current RMP.\n\nProcess Information\nThe site is located 8 miles South of Fresno, California between Hwy 41 and Hwy 99. The\ntopography is generally flat and is rural, dedicated to farming with orchards and vineyards\nsurrounding the facility for several miles in most directions. Ambient temperatures are\nseldom below freezing in the winter and summer highs are over 100 degrees F several\ndays each year. Winds are still during the winter and slight breezes are typical morning\nand afternoon the remainder of the year.\nT"

      "SummaryText": "he ammonia refrigeration system at Fowler Packing is of a flooded design in which liquid\nammonia is used in a metal pipe evaporator coil to cool air or water to remove field heat from fresh fruit for seasonal storage. Most ammonia containing components are with-in the building structures so the facility and refrigeration equipemnt are isolated from the public and all unauthorized personnel. The facility has 24X7 security and perimeter fencing.\nFacilities requiring refrigeration include 7 Precoolers, 10 Storage Rooms, Mechanical Room, and 2 packing areas. Five screw compressors are in the North Mechanical Room and 2 in the South Mechanical room. Three evaporative condensers are located\nbetween the mechanical rooms on structural steel support stands. One high\npressure receiver vessel is located inside the mechanical room and a secondary receiver is\nlocated adjacent to the mechanical room under the evaporative condenser.\nSuction and discharge piping is primarily located on roof areas accessible only to\nauthorized personnel. Room evaporator coils are located in enclosed bunkers behind one\nwall in each room. Bin Rooms and the refrigerated hallway use suspended coils supported within the refrigerated space from the roof structure.\n\nAll of the system pressure vessels and equipment are protected by pressure safety relief\nvalves. These relief valves are piped to a water filled diffusion tank. Ammonia detection provides constant monitoring, alarms and shut down.\n\nRefrigeration controls are programmable logic control (PLC) based with electric valve\nactuators. All critical components have redundancy, fail-safe positions for power outages,\nand can be operated manually if required. In the event of power failure the system design\nautomatically maintains safe system pressures and the system restarts automatically upon\nreturn of power."
