This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility. It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nOur facilities primary activities encompass organic vegetable packing, storage and shipping. We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our plant.\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 18,266 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario: \r\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPAs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPAs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nOur facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nFor the purposes of safely conduction activities within our covered processes, our facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as necessary.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nOur facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available from the manufacturer, the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identifies by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemical, technology, equipment and procedures.
