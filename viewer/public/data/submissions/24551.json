      "SummaryText": "The West Lake Water Treatment plant has a design capacity to handle 10 million gallons per day  The plant is a conventional design (sedimentation, flocculation) with two rapid sand filters.  Water flows by gravity through a thirty-inch pipeline from West Lake Reservoir, located approximately three miles away.  The raw water flows into the plant and is injected with aluminum sulfate.  The water containing aluminum sulfate proceeds into the rapid mix bay where the alum and water are mixed.  The water then flows into to separate flow trains (east & west).  The water proceeds into two flocculation tanks where the water containing alum is gently mixed to ensure proper contact with suspended solids in the water.  The water then flows into the sedimentation tanks where the ?flocs? (colloidal aluminum hydroxide settle to the bottom of the tank and the supernatant flows in to the filter area.  Once the water has made it into the filter, the filter media (sand) removes any remaining solids in the water.  From here the water is injected with caustic soda (for pH control), chlorine (for disinfection), and fluoride (for dental hygiene)  At this point the water is stored in a 523,000 gallon low clearwell waiting to be pumped to the 523,000 high clearwell and then to distribution."
