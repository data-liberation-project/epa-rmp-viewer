      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPOPE & TALBOT\n\n\nPope & Talbot, Inc. (P&T) is a Kraft pulp mill which produces market pulps.  The Pope & Talbot mill is located in Halsey, Oregon.  The company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for P&T workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Halsey mill.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at P&T and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at P&T.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Pope & Talbot.\n\nThe risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes \n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPope & Talbot is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental release of hazardous substances.  The facility implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substa"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  Pope & Talbot provides response training to personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  \n\nIn order to implement these policies, P&T established a management system directed by the Human Resource Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPope & Talbot is a pulp mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached and semi-bleached pulp.  As part of this manufacturing process, the facility handles several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes.\n\nProcess\tProgram Level\tRegulated Substance\tProcess Quantity\nlbs\nFilter Plant\t3\tChlorine\t10,000\nChlorine Dioxide Plant\t3\tChlorine Dioxide\t19,000 \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSince the mill was constructed in 1969, a prevention program has been in place to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, P&T formalized this prevention program for the filter plant to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1998, prior to the building of the chlorine dioxide generator, P&T began implementing OSHA process safety management.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements:\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the ele"

      "SummaryText": "ments of the prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Program 3 prevention program for chlorine and chlorine dioxide consists of the following 12 elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information.  P&T maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of chlorine and chlorine dioxide, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.  P&T ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the local emergency personnel, and the fire department.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis.  P&T performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of operating and engineering personnel with process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Pope & Talbot uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The team prepares a written report describing the results of the analyses, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the process supervisory personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures.  P&T personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during"

P&T trains workers to safely and effectively perform assigned tasks.  The P&T training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.\n\nMechanical Integrity.  Pope & Talbot maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n\u00b7 Specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment.\n\u00b7 Specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n\u00b7 Procedures for inspecting, testing and maintaining process equipment\n\u00b7 Procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, and line or equipment opening\n\u00b7 Training of maintenance personnel\n\u00b7 Documentation of maintenance activities\n\nManagement of Change.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review.  The company performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n\n\u00b7 Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\u00b7 Safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\n\u00b7 Employee training has been completed\n\u00b7 A process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\nCompliance Audit.  Pope & Talbot audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues.  P&T assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in OSHA's Process Safety Management, RMP rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the OSHA rule and the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation.

An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\nEmployee Participation.  P&T has a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of workers are addressed.  P&T encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the prevention program, including process hazard analyses and operating procedures.\n\nHot Work Permits.  P&T has a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Halsey mill.  The mill reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the P&T safe work practices orientation.\n\nContractors.  Pope & Talbot has a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the Halsey mill are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that only contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks are hired.  P&T explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, P&T safe work practices, and P&T emergency response procedures.  P&T requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that worker begins work at the Halsey mill.  P&T periodically reviews co"

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is used for water treatment at the filter plant.  For the water treatment, chlorine is fed through piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  There is an area sensor that will close the valve to the 1-ton cylinder if high chlorine leaks are detected. \n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is generated on site.  The chlorine dioxide generator was designed as a fail-safe design.  In emergency situations, the chemicals supplied to the generator are stopped.  The reaction is quenched with chilled water.  In a power failure situation, the valves for the tank with the chilled water fail open so that the reaction will immediately be quenched.  Chlorine dioxide is stored at a stable temperature of 45 \u00b0F in refrigerated tanks that are continually swept with air to remove any residual chlorine dioxide.  The residual chlorine dioxide is sent back into the generator system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nPope & Talbot has completed a five-year accident history for chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  There has not benn any accidents in the past five years.  Chlorine dioxide is a chemical that started being used on site in October 2000.\n\nYear\tNumber of Reported Accidents\t\nSubstance Released\t\nConsequences\n1999\n\tNone\t\t\n2000\n\tNone\t\t\n2001\n\tNone\t\t\n2002\n\tNone\t\t\n2003\nNone\n2004\n\tNone\t\t\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nP&T has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of"

All P&T personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  P&T periodically conducts emergency response drills on site with the Pope & Talbot emergency response teams and also coordinates drills with the local fire department.\n\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29CFR 1910.38(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  P&T maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief, and P&T provides appropriate information to the fire chief.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nP&T constantly strives to improve the safety of the processes at P&T through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The following changes to improve safety are planned or have recently been completed.\n\nBecause of an accidental release in September 1998, P&T reviewed the chlorine handling system and eliminated excessive corrosion due to water condensation in the equipment by replacing the purge air with dry nitrogen.  These changes reduce the likelihood of a chlorine release caused by degraded equipment or external impact."
