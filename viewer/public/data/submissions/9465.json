      "SummaryText": "     Equilon Pipeline Company LLC is a petroleum products transportation company.  Equilon Pipeline Company LLC loads Liquid Propane and Liquid Propylene at its Sorrento, Louisiana Tank Car Loading Facility.  This facility recieves tank cars from the railroad adjacent US Highway 61 in Ascension Parish, Louisiana.  The facility is located approximately 1 mile South of the junction of US Highway 61 and Interstate 10 near Sorrento, Louisiana.   The tank car rack has the capability to load up to 12 railroad tank cars on the loading rack siding track.   Propane and Propylene are petroleum products produced in oil refineries.  Propane is typically used for home heating and cooking fuel.  Propylene is similar in property to propane, but is used as a feedstock for plastic plants to manufacture polypropylene.\n     Equilon Pipeline Company has determined a hypothetical RMP Worst Case Accidental Release Scenario to be the release of the contents of a full Propylene Rail Tank Car.  The result may be a low hovering vapor cloud which could travel across US Highway 61.  The ignition of this cloud would cause a vapor explosion, resulting in a 1 psi overpressure that could potentially be felt at a distance of 0.5 miles from the tank car release site.  There are no know public receptors (as defined by the EPA RMP rule) within 0.5 miles of this site as of the date of analysis.\n     Within the last five years there were no RMP accidental releases from RMP covered processes that resulted in on site or offsite impacts as defined by the EPA RMP rule from a release of propylene or propane from the described process.                                                                                                 \n     Sharing the information contained in this RMP is intended to promote community understanding of the facility's chemical accident prevention program as of the date of this RMP.  It is not a prediction of the probability that any of the identified scenarios or potential impacts d"
