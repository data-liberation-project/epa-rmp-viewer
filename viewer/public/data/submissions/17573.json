('68.155(a) ).\n\nSoutheast Frozen Foods, Inc. prevents accidental releases through classroom and on the job training of refrigeration personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 10,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. facility.\n\n3.0  Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1 Southeast Frozen Food's topography is described as Rural, and is entered into the dispersion models as the surface roughness parameter.   \n\n3.2  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe ammonia storage receiver, located outside the Machine Room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank holds approximately 4,400 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 85% full, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 181 psig and 95 0F, and is used to recharge the system. This tank is filled approximately every two months.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe dispersion model, Degadis, predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 2.1 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B)"

ADT security monitoring company ((800) 232-2238) receives an alarm whenever an emergency plant shutdown occurs.\n\n6.2  Red Cross shelter resources in the Cordele area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with local schools and some local churches.  Schools and churches that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would have food, cots, and first aid supplies on site and reserve supplies would be shipped in from Albany, GA.  The Cordele Fire Department or Police Chief would activate the Red Cross if they are needed and would arrive within two hours with the Emergency Response Vehicles.  They are able to provide first-aid, refreshments, and clean clothing for the emergency response workers.  The Fire or Police Chief would decide if sheltering in place or evacuation and sheltering is required in a given emergency.  If evacuation is needed, the Red Cross would then activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area.  Those in need of medical attention would be taken to a nearby hospital.  Reference:  Penny Bulin, Executive Director, Red Cross Office of Albany, Georgia, (912) 436-4845. \n\n7.0  Planned changes to improve safety ('68.155(g)).\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. consist of:\n\n7 Coordinating a written emergency response plan with the Cordele Fire Department and a nearby HAZMAT emergency response contracto"

A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that lie within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Section 9.0. \n\n3.3  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate Case, more likely, Release Scenario for Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. was selected to involve a relief valve release on the high pressure receiver.  The relief valve discharges outside the Machine Room.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators onsite, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.\n\nThe Degadis air dispersion model predicted, with a wind speed of 6 mph and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.22 miles. Landview approximated 19 people resided within the release radius (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia) of the facility, however, there are no residences located within 0.22 miles of the facility.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the radius to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.0  Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\nSoutheast Frozen Foods, Inc. standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR  guidelines.  Accidental release prevention practices at Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. include:\n\n7 Annual operator refresher training.\n7 Routine preventative maintenance and inspections.\n7 Refrigeration system repairs made in a prompt, safe manner.\n7"
