UAP Distribution, Inc., is the owner of this facility.  As part of corporate restructering, UAP Pueblo (Pueblo Chemical and Supply Co., Inc.) is no longer a legal entity.  \n\nFor more information regarding this plan, contact Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; John Vogt, Location Manager, UAP, 901 East Highway 6, Imperial, NE. 69033 (308) 882-4308.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\na) The owners, management and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nA) This facility has been owned and operated by UAP Distribition, Inc., or one of its subsidiaries, since March 18, 1998.  All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nB) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the manufacturing of 10-34-00, a liquid fertilizer used by farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia stored on site is used only for this purpose.\n\nC) Anhydrous ammonia is reacted with water and phosphoric acid to produce 10-34-00, a liquid fertilizer.  This reaction takes place using a T-Reactor, a permanent fixture at the facility.\n\nD) The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the largest tank is approximately 78,000 pounds.  This represents filling the storage tank to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nA) The worst-case scenario is based on"

The quantity released would equal approximately 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest tank filled to 85% capacacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.19 miles.\n\nB) The alternate-case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity release would be approximately 12,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61.1, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nB) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials.\n\nC) This facility follows the Anhydrous Ammonia Standards enforced by the Nebraska State Fire Marshal, and is inspected by them on a regular basis.\n\nD) The facility is inspected on at least a monthly basis by employees knowledgable in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nA) There have been no accidents in the previous five years involving the release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nA) This facility has an emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB) This facility has provided State and Local Agencies the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nC) This facility has a written emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, which includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.
