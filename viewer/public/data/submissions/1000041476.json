This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\n\n\nThe Black Canyon Facility, located about 17 miles northwest of LaBarge, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes one primary operation (dehydration) to prepare the natural gas/liquid mixture for transportation to the ExxonMobil Production Company Shute Creek Facility for processing.  This facility could contain a regulated flammable mixture and a regulated toxic substance.  Transportation of natural gas regulated substances into and out of the facility is handled via pipeline.  Regulated flammable liquids are trucked out of the facility.  This facility is surrounded by rolling hills and mountains.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \n\n\n\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the USEPA, data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.  Refer to Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this plan.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention "

Processes at this facility regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\n\n\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.

This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a PHA delta revalidation process, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operating/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on relative risk.  Resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original"
