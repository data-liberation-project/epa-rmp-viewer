Personnel have the ability to respond to minor and major ammonia releases or spills and have received HAZWOPER training. In the event that an ammonia release does occur that is outside the capabilities of he trained refrigeration technicians to mitigate safely, off-site responders will be notified, specifically the Bowling Green Fire Department and the Warren Count LEPC. Country Ove Bakery\u0092s emergency response team will respond in coordination and discretion of the off-site responders. \nThe plan is promptly updated to reflect and pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Country Oven Bakery Inc. is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility.

In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Country Oven Bakery - Bowling Green, KY facility is located at 2840 Pioneer Drive, Bowling Green, Kentucky. We manufacture baked products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \nThe facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 42,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia between two separate refrigeration processes onsite. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nCountry Oven Bakery is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.

      "SummaryText": "n Fire Department and Warren County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration systems. The systems purposes is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Country Oven Bakery processing operations. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Country Oven Bakery is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenarios(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of this RMP Submittal.\nTo evaluate and calculate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, ALHOA software was utilized. To determine what, if any, public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios we determined through the use of MARPLOT mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2010 data.\n\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThese scenarios were selected from the multitude of scenarios discussed during the recent PHA. These included external events, human error, piping, vessels, evaporators, compressors, pumps, heat exchangers, controls, and many others. The worst-case release was selected due to the greater distance to endpoint. The alternate release was selected due to its more likely occurrence.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have no ammonia related incidents at the Country Oven Bakery facility within the last five years that have resulted in a reportable quantity. \n\nEMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\nCountry Oven Bakery\u0092s current Emergency Action Plan"
