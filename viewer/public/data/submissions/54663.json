      "SummaryText": "The Chester Metropolitan District Filter Plant located on Hwy 9 in Ft. Law, SC uses chlorine to disinfect water.  The CMD filter plant has trained personnel onsite at all times.  Filter plant personnel are trained in chlorine cylinder procedures, which include connecting, disconnecting and emergency procedures.  The chlorination process is equipped with automatic shutoff valves in the event of a loss of vacuum pressure.  The chlorine storage area has gas monitors to detect chlorine gas leaks.  The CMD filter plant purchases DOT approved cylinders.  In the event of a chlorine gas leak, filter plant personnel have been trained in HAZWOPER for initial response.  If needed, the personel will call the local fire department and chlorine supplier for emergency response.  The CMD filter plant has not had an incident involving chlorine in the past 5 years.  CMD will continue to upgrade the chlorination process with the latest controls as they become available and feasible to implement."
