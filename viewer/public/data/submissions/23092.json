The protection of the environment and the control of environmental matters receive top priority, support, and participation by all employees.\n\nEmergency Response Policy\n\nU. S. Agri-Chemicals is committed to training and equipping its personnel to handle incidental releases of ammonia and expects its personnel to summon appropriate professional services to handle any incident that escalates beyond their capability.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handling \n\nFt. Meade Chemical Plant's primary product is phosphoric acid.  It is used as a main ingredient to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by truck or railcar and is stored in a vessel called a bullet.  Ammonia is combined with phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nU.S. Agri-Chemicals' Accidental Release Prevention Program includes:\n\n? Requirement to ensure covered process equipment is properly designed with emergency shutoff\n? Training of maintenance personnel and testing of critical covered process equipment\n? Written operating procedures and training of operators\n? Safety inspections, reviews, and audits of covered process equipment\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNone\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nU.S. Agri-Chemicals' Emergency Response Program includes:\n\n? Written Emergency Response Plan\n? Joint emergency response exercises conducted with community responders\n? Availability of emergency response equipment\n\nDescription of Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nRelease of entire contents of 175-ton ammonia bullet (80% full - 280,000 pounds) over a period of 10 minutes.  The distance to end-point based on Degadose Air Dispersion Modeling is 1.6 miles.\n\nDescription of Alternative Release Scenario\n\nFailure of a transfer hose during truck unloading to"

The distance to end-point based on Degadose Air Dispersion Modeling is 0.61 miles.\n\nEPA has acknowledged that there are inherent uncertainties associated with the use of any air dispersion model.\n\nEPA also has acknowledged that consistent with sound modeling practices and the requirements specified in the rule, different models may be used as appropriate.  Therefore, U.S. Agri-Chemicals elected to use a model different than the one used by EPA to generate the look-up table."
