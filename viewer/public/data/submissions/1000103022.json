Phillips 66 believes that excellent performance in the areas of health, environment, safety, and security goes hand-in-hand with operational excellence and financial success. In fulfilling this commitment, the Terminal will comply with regulatory requirements, provide and maintain a safe working environment using acceptable and proven business practices. All Phillips 66 employees will strive to identify and eliminate hazards which could result in injury and illness, damage to the environment, property damage, and security losses. The Terminal is operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors, and the community in which it operates. Phillips 66 promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This summary provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed and implemented. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nThe Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage facility used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail or commercial end-users. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, transmix, diesel fuel, jet fuel, butane, propane, and various other petroleum-based additives. \n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Terminal (herein referred to as the \u0093Facility\u0094) covers two processes: \n1. The Dehydration Regeneration Systems with butane\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and includes by reference the attached Process Safety Management Program elements in 29 CFR Part 1910.1"

      "SummaryText": "19. The Processes at the Terminal are classified as Program Level 3 under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThe objectives of this hazard assessment are twofold: (1) satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and (2) provide Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) information that will help local emergency planning officials improve community emergency response in the event of an accidental release at the site. Due to the nature of covered substances (propane, butane), OCA focused on potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following: \n\u0095\tExplosion: Overpressure of 1 Psig \n\u0095\tRadiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds. \n\u0095\tLower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources. \nThe facility has submitted to the EPA a worst case and alternative release scenario for the regulated substance held in the covered process. The facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs) to show release scenarios that may have a more realistic chance of occurrence. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the RMP submission. \nSince no changes in inventory of the regulated substance or the operating conditions of the covered process have occurred in the last 5 years, the facility revalidated the Worst-Case and Alternate Scenarios that were modeled for the 2017 submission. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \nPhillips 66's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the facility's regulated substance to employees, contractors, the pu"

Due to that fact, the accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the PSM regulation requirements. The following accident prevention programs are in place at the Terminal: \n1.\tEmployee Participation, \n2.\tProcess Safety Information, \n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA), \n4.\tStandard Operating Procedures,\n5.\tOperator Training, \n6.\tContractors, \n7.\tPre-startup Safety Review, \n8.\tMechanical Integrity,\n9.\tHazardous Work Authorization (Hot Work, etc.), \n10.\tManagement of Change,\n11.\tIncident Investigation, \n12.\tEmergency Procedures/Planning, \n13.\tCompliance Audits, and \n14.\tTrade Secrets\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history. \nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\u0095\tOnsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \n\u0095\tOffsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\nThere have been no reportable RMP accidents/incidents related to the operation of the covered system during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThe Terminal Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Contained within the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility. These emergencies may include airborne releases of chemica"

The facility's focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations. The goal of the Terminal is to demonstrate continuous improvement in its health, environmental and safety performance. In addition, Phillips 66 will work cooperatively with our neighbors to ensure the health, environment, safety, and security of the Terminal and surrounding community. Since the last RMP submission one PHAs revalidation have been conducted to improved process safety using LOPA for assessing high consequence scenarios. PHA/LOPA recommendations are tracked and completed in a timely manner. In 2021, Independent Protection Layers (IPL) were evaluated and the IPL list was updated."
