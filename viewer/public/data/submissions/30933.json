This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the Anydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System process at our facility.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we have coordinated Emergency Response procedures with the Cincinnati Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release of ammonia.\n\n\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Company uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant for cooling storage rooms, water, and beer in its operation at 1625 Central Parkway.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System consists of a main ammonia receiver tank, eight shell and tube heat exchangers, twenty-five evaporators, an ammonia vapor accumulator, eight compressors and three evaporative condensers.\n\n We only have one (1) regulated substance [Ammonia] present at our facility.  The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is 13,200 lbs. recirculated through the various equipment pieces mentioned above.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the Accidental Release Prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with both IIAR and ASHRAE Ammonia Refrigeration Standards.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our Accidental Release Prevention Pr"

Process safety information is maintained by the Plant Engineer and Safety Manager.\n\nProcess Hazard Review:\n\nOur facility has conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with the refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these hazard reviews is the HAZOP Methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations and are re-validated at regular intervals of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Samuel Adams Brewery Co. has written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as normal operation, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and normal startup after a maintenance activity.  The information is regularly reviewed by key personnel and is readily accessible to all operators involved with operating the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\nTraining:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.  Ammonia system Operating Engineers are consulted as to the frequency of the ammonia system training required.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSamuel Adams"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  receiver tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Records of maintenance activities are kept in the Plant Engineer's office.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Samuel Adams Brewery Co. to manage changes in the process,  technology, equipment and procedures.  Operating Engineers, Maintenance Engineers or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are involved with the Managment of Change Reviews and other employees are promptly made aware of and training is given to deal with the modification(s).  MOC forms are signed off by the Plant Engineer, Safety Manager, and Plant Manager. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as needed at Samuel Adams Brewery Co..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing new or modified equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring. There have been no reportable releases that invoke the 5-year accident history reporting requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. truly believes that Process Safety Management and Accident Prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Our employees are involved with the Process Hazard Analysis, developing maintenance procedures, reviewing operating procedures, and lead the the Management of Change Process.  Our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, Samuel Adams Brewery Co. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Samuel Adams Brewery Co. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of regulated substances occur.\n \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 25 years.  Due to our preventative maintenance programs, daily refrigeration system checks, etc., the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from our facility within the last 10 years.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nSamuel Adams Brewery Co. has written emergency response procedures to deal with any accidental releases of Ammonia.

Hamilton County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee with which Samuel Adams Brewery Co. interacts with to conduct joint drills, tests and the filing of Form R inventory reports.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our Accidental Release Prevention Program.We have installed a new remote actuator on the king valve.  We have installed trip switches on the hot gas line. Below are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented byDecember 31, 2004.\nA. Finish replacement of relief valves in the refrigeration system.\nB.
