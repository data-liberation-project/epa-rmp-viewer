Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe management and employees of this Crop Production Service facility are committed to the prevention of any release of chemicals handled at this facility.  If a release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local hazardous materials team, the local fire department, the local administering agency, and our emergency response contractor to control, contain and clean up the release.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and sale of liquid and dry fertilizers and pre-packaged and bulk agricultural chemicals to growers and ranchers.\n\nThis facility stores and handles two regulated chemicals - Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.  It is also used at this facility for the production of Aqua Ammonia.\n\nAqua Ammonia is produced and stored at the facility.  It is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.\n\n3.
