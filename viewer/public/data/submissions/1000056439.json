This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  Enterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

      "SummaryText": "on if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in the emergency procedures, and they are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Propane Terminal facility.   \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program is coordinated with the Wake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Apex Propane Terminal has instituted necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and local emergency responders (e.g. fire department).  This will provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Apex Propane Terminal conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization.  The Apex Propane Terminal facility also currently provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substances handled by the propane terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal facility resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Changes are usually planned in response to PHA's, safety audits and incident investigation findings.  Changes may also be installed as a result of employee operations or safety improvement suggestions.   At the current time, th following changes planned for the Apex Propane Terminal are being installed to improve facility safety.\n\n\n\n* Gas detection and fire eyes will be installed around the salt bath heater."
