The WTP stores four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine and the raw water intake stores two 1-ton cylinders of chlorine.  The storage quantities of chlorine exceed threshold at both the WTP and the raw water intake.  Therefore they are covered facilities under the Risk Management regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 68.  For purposes of these regulations, these facilities are classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis (worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario) was conducted using look-up tables contained in the RMP guidance for wastewater treatment facilities.  Worst case release from the WTP covers a radius of 3 miles and affects 7135 persons and a worst case release from the raw water intake covers a radius of 3 miles and affects approximately 500 people. An alternative release at the WTP and the raw water intake both cover 0.3 miles and may impact no more than 10 people.  Public receptors are impacted by the worst case release scenario and not by the alternative release scenario.  \n\nThe RMP provides a prevention program developed for Program 2 facilities.  Leak scenarios discussed include: small, medium and worst case release scenario.  \n\nThe emergency response program discusses response procedures, safety equipment and training, reporting procedures, notification procedures, and communication with public."
