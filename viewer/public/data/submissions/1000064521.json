MicroMetrics Systems is located in Meadows of Dan, Virginia with 146 employees and processes flexible metal for rotary die cutting of various labels, films and substrates. The manufacturing process involves etching of the metal with an acidic solution that is regenerated with chlorine gas. Increased production requires the storage of chlorine above the EPA threshold planning quantity and requires the submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP). There have been no reportable chlorine releases during the last five years and no incidents affecting the surrounding area in over 31 years of processing. The company has an OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) with a process hazard analysis. \n\n  \n\nThe chlorine storage/feed area is housed in a building that is constructed primarily of metal and masonry block. The actual cylinder handling and feed system is similar to that used by municipal water and waste water plants. The chlorine cylinder feed and etch rooms are separated from each other and the remaining building space. All areas are equipped with leak detectors and ventilation. In the event of a chlorine leak audible and visual alarms are activated in the building. Regular evacuation drills are conducted.\n\n\n\nAll employees have received training on the standard operating procedures and the procedures to follow if a chlorine leak was to occur. These instructions are written in the Standard Operating Procedures, the Process Safety Manual, and the Emergency Response Plan. The procedures are based on the procedures prescribed in the Chlorine Manual from the Chlorine Institute, Inc.   Emergency telephone numbers are listed in the manuals and posted around the plant. The contacts include the Laural Fork Fire Department, the company HAZMAT team, the chemical supplier and other appropriate agencies. As par"

We also provide the LEPC and the Fire Department, with Tier II notification of our inventory on a yearly basis.The land is uneven and has a number of trees.\n\n  \n\nThe safe handling of chemicals is critical to our process and the company takes these steps and others to assure the continued safety of our employees and the surrounding area.\n\n"
