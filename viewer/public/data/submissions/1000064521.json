Micrometrics Systems is a Maxcess brand and global company with headquarters in Oakbrook, Illinois.  MicroMetrics Systems is located in Meadows of Dan, Virginia with 191 employees and processes flexible metal for rotary die cutting of various labels, films and substrates. The manufacturing process involves etching of the metal with an acidic solution that is regenerated with chlorine gas. Production requires the storage of chlorine above the EPA threshold planning quantity and requires a Risk Management Plan (RMP). There have been no reportable chlorine releases during the last five years and no incidents affecting the surrounding area. The company has an OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) with a process hazard analysis. \n  \nThe chlorine storage/feed area is housed in a building that is constructed primarily of metal and masonry block. The actual cylinder handling and feed system is similar to that used by municipal water and waste water plants. The chlorine cylinder feed and etch rooms are separated from each other and the remaining building space. All areas are equipped with leak detectors and ventilation. In the event of a chlorine leak audible and visual alarms are activated in the building. Regular evacuation drills are conducted.\n\nAll employees have received training on the standard operating procedures and the procedures to follow if a chlorine leak was to occur. These instructions are in written Work Instructions, the Process Safety Manual, and the Emergency Response Plan. The procedures are based on the procedures prescribed in the Chlorine Manual from the Chlorine Institute, Inc.   Emergency telephone numbers are listed in the manuals and programmed in each phone. The contacts include the Laurel Fork Fire Department, the company Hazwoper team, the chemical supplier and other appropriate agencies. As part of the company Hazwoper team, employees have been train"

We also provide the LEPC and the Fire Department, with Tier II notification of our inventory on a yearly basis.
