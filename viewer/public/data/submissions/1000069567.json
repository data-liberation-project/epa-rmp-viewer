Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nSunnyside Packing Company operates a commercial cold storage for a variety of fruit and vegetables in Selma, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(6) Rooms\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nAll control valve groups are located outside each room along the exterior wall inside the hallway. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nMachinery Room\n\n(5) Reciprocating compressors\n\n(5) Oil separators\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\n\n(1) Main suction accumulator\n\n\n\nCondenser Area\n\n(2) Evaporative condensers\n\n\n\nRoom 1\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(2) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 2\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(2) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 3\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 4\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 5\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 6\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\n\n\n\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall.

      "SummaryText": " liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sunnyside Packing Company consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Sunnyside Packing Company is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nSunnyside Pack"

These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sunnyside Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSunnyside Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nSunnyside Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR ?1910.119(n)\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 ?2765.1-2765.2\n\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Respon"

Nevertheless, Sunnyside Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sunnyside Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sunnyside Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nSunnyside Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sunnyside Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the futu"
