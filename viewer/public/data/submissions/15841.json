All five of the utilities Department employees hold licenses in wastewater treatment. Chemical safety knowledge is necessary to pass the exam to be  a certified wastewater operator.                                                                                                                  The Hardeeville WWTP maintains a supply of 2000lbs. to 4000lbs of chlorine gas on site. The chlorine is used to disinfect the processed effluent from the WWTP before discharge to the recieving waterway.         Each and every day the chlorine injection equipment is inspected for leaks or any other malfunction. The chlorine usage is recorded daily so gas on hand can be inventoried. If a problem with the equipment is detected the equipment is taken off line and the standby system is placed online. The inoperable equipment is repaired or replaced as the problem dictates. All gas feed linesare replaced and the equipment is serviced every six months by the supplier as recommended.                                                                                                          The Hardeville WWTP currently treats an average flow of 400,000 or .400MGD. The plant is permitted by the EPA to treat a maximum flow of 1.01MGD or 1,010,000 gallons a day.                                                        The chlorine is used at the last stage of treatment to disinfect the wastewater treatment plant effluent.        A worst case scenario for chlorine was formulated using EPA Guidance software. This assumes a loss of 1500lbs of chlorine gas. The cylinders containing Cl2 gas are contained within a  block room which is open to one side to the outdoors, with enclosed portions of the building and trees in the local landscape, the projected endpoint of gas travel would be .8 miles "

Inn this scenario 1500lbs ofCl2 gas is lost via failed transfer hose. The endpoint of the alternative scenario was .1 miles.                    There have been no accidental releases of Chlorine in the pass 5 years from this facility.                              The EMP for the Hrdeeville WWTP is coordinated with the Hardeeville Fire Dept."
