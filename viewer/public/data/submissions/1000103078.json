Updates to RMP\n\n   As of this filing, Inframark has contractually taken over the daily operations of our water treatment facility and our Compliance department has also undergone a change in management. The original RMP was promulgated in 1999 and has undergone updates in 2004, 2008 and 2009. Given the age of the original RMP, changes in management and plant processes necessitated a complete review of all Emergency Plans for our facility. All changes have been made and the RMP has been updated."
