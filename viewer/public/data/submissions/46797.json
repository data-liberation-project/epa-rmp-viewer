      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Materials\nThe National Welders Supply Company facility located in Charlotte, NC is primarily an acetylene production plant.  Acetylene gas is manufactured at the facility.  Also, various industrial gases are repackaged at the facility by the transfill of cryogenic gases from bulk tanks into compressed gas cylinders.  Some gases, including chlorine, are simply received in cylinders, stored on site, and shipped to customers.   The facility has determined that the quantities of acetylene and chlorine may reach the regulatory thresholds under RMP.  The facility also covers these materials under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program.   \n\nNational Welders conducts its operations to prevent possible releases or harm to its products, employees and to the surrounding area and residents.  National Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the acetylene process and the safe handling of compressed gas cylinders (including chlorine) to prevent any accidental release.  Along with written standard operating procedures, several administrative controls are used.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \n\nThe company uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program. The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling regulated materials in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them. The PHA included a team review of the process using the ?what-if/checklist? methodology to identify hazards, review of previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.  \n\nChlorine\nThe quantity of chlorine stored on site is being increased to potentially be above RMP threshold quantities.  The chlorine is received, handled and shipped in 150 lb cylinders.  N"

      "SummaryText": "o chlorine cylinder filling, releasing, transferring, or servicing is part of the normal National Welders operations.  National Welders anticipates a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds of chlorine (80 cylinders @150 lb. each).  Metal pallets with safety belts or hand trucks are used to safely move and store the cylinders.  \n\nThe National Welders facility in Charlotte, NC has not had a reportable chlorine release or accident to date.\n\nAcetylene\nAcetylene gas is generated by a process from calcium carbide and water.  The maximum amount of acetylene at the facility is estimated to be 15,000 lbs.\n\nThe National Welders facility in Charlotte, NC has not had an acetylene release or accident within the past 5 years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nNational Welders Supply Company has a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to be implemented in case of an accident, release or spill of a hazardous material.  The EAP is a separate document. National Welders maintains a trained hazardous material response team in accordance with the company?s Emergency Response Manual.  The Emergency Response Manual and EAP outline the trained personnel, equipment, and actions that are to be taken in case of a release of a hazardous material.  Hazardous material communication training is also conducted to protect the safety of all employees.\n\nIn the event of an acetylene incident, mitigation controls include the Plant Deluge System, the Plant Alarm System, and the employee Evacuation Plan. \n\nFor potential chlorine releases, National Welders maintains emergency equipment including emergency cylinder repair kits and cylinder containment vessels available for trained responders to stop or contain gas leaks."
