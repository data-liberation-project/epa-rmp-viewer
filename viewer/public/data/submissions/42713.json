If an emergency related to the ammonia storage system were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our on-site emergency response program.\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled:  This facility manufactures silicon carbide wafers and semiconductor devices for the microelectronic and other industries.  Ammonia is used in the manufacturing process.  Ammonia is stored in 6 22,000-pound tanks. \n\nWorst-case release scenario:  The worst-case release scenario is the failure of one 22,000-pound tank resulting in a vapor cloud.  Using RMPCompTM, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.63 miles.  Off-site public receptors include a residential population of approximately 7458, and commercial, retail and light industrial facilities within the Research Triangle Park and the City of Durham.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility has developed and implemented the requirements for an OSHA PSM Plan for the facility.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Cree has never had an accident involving the Bulk Ammonia system that resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place. \n\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia storage system, it is Cree's policy to implement our emergency response program.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and other pertinent officials.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  This system was designed with redundant safety systems, and currently no changes are planned."
