(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Hutchinson Fractionator is one of many facilities owned and operated by ONEOK.  The facility receives liquid residue from natural gas facilities as feedstock totaling up to 58,000 barrels per day (bpd).  The liquid feed to the facility is split into five product streams in a series of fractionator columns:  E-P Mix, Propane, Isobutane, Normal Butane, and Natural Gasoline.  These five product streams are further purified to remove contaminants such as water, carbon dioxide, and mercaptans.  The purity products are stored in tanks or caverns and are distributed to various customers via pipeline.  The facility is also equipped with two truck-unloading docks, which allow purity products to be loaded or unloaded.  \n\nMethane, Ethane, Propane, Pentane, Isobutane, and Butane are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Hutchinson Fractionator in amounts above threshold quantity.

      "SummaryText": "here are no toxic chemicals present at the facility.  Sulfuric acid is stored at the facility; however, it is not a listed RMP substance and therefore, is not being reported in this RMP.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \n\n\n \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Hutchinson Fractionator is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the impact of releases by providing gas detectors throughout the process and on brine ponds.Minimizing the possibility of releases by having a continuous flare tied into each tower and storage cavern and other critical equipment.\n?Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?Installing continuous monitoring and control systems.\n?Installing surveillance cameras to check for r"

The Hutchinson Fractionator Facility Manager or designee is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Mechanical Integrity provis"

The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
