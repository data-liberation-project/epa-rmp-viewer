The refrigeration system has an inventory of ammonia that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to workers as well as the surrounding communities and the environment.\n\n\n\nIt is Buddy's Kitchen's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of ammonia is paramount at Buddy's Kitchen.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of ammonia are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which ammonia refrigerant is handled, the safety devices inherent to the refrigeration system design, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of Buddy's Kitchen workers.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Evacuation Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Buddy's Kitchen coordinates emergency response activities with the local emergency management organizations.  This ensures prompt res"

It is located at 21150 Hamburg Avenue in Lakeville, Minnesota, Dakota County.\n\n\n\nOnly one chemical covered by 40 CFR Part 68 is inventoried at the Lakeville site.  This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\n\n\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) - Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant.  It is received into the plant by truck, however deliveries of ammonia are infrequent.\n\n\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nBuddy's Kitchen contracted with an outside consulting firm to assist in the refinement of the prevention program tailored exclusively to ammonia refrigeration operations.  This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of the prevention program is to ensure complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nBuddy's Kitchen completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation of the ammonia refrigeration system in September 2021.  The recommendations generated during this review were prioritized using a standardized Risk Rank Matrix method and resolution will be in a timely fashion.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history\n\n\n\nBuddy's Kitchen has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained in the prevention program procedures.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\n\n\n\nIndividuals knowledgeable in refrigeration operation or the equipment being investigated lead formal incident investigations.  Root cause and corrective actions are determined and formal reports are prepared.  Progress regarding corrective action on al"

The emergency plan is a vital part of Buddy's Kitchen overall prevention program.  Buddy's Kitchen continues to plan for the unplanned ammonia release while striving to adhere to the latest mechanical integrity and inherently safer technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned improvements to reduce risk\n\n\n\nIn accordance with its risk management program, Buddy's Kitchen conducts continuous self-examination evaluations designed to identify and assess process/operational risk employees and the community.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration employs an audio and visual leak detection and repair program that requires multiple checks per day.  In addition, ammonia detectors are strategically located throughout the facility to quickly detect any releases."
