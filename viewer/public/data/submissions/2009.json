THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CROPMATE COMPANY/UAP, 8 BENNETT STREET, YODER, INDIANA ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS  PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS     \n     AMMONIA FOR PRODUCTION OF NON-HAZARDOUS LIQUID FERTILIZER FOR AGRICULTURAL   \n     USE.\n\nB. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND BLENDED AS A FERTILIZER  \n    NUTRIENTS FOR AGRICULTURAL CROPS.\n\nC. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY THAT CAN BE STORED IS  131,325 LBS., IN ONE 30,000 GAL. \n    STORAGE TANK.  THE NORMAL METHOD OF RECEIVING AMMONIA AT THE FACILITY IS BY \n    TRUCK TRANSPORT CONTAINING 43,000 POUNDS.\n     \n         (Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL                      \n    CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.\n    THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 131,325 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS \n    THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN \n    STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS\n    1.16 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY           \n    (OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER        \n    HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS  0.56 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n1. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY"
