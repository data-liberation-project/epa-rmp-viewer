This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nDry Trail Plant is located in Texas County, Oklahoma, 12 miles north of Guymon, Oklahoma on Highway 136, 10 miles west on County Road 7.  Dry Trail Plant recovers carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas from an oil field that is using liquid carbon dioxide injection for secondary oil recovery.  In the process of extracting the CO2 and returning it to a liquid state, natural gas and natural gas liquids are also recovered.  Propane is used as the coolant to restore the CO2 to a liquid state.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with the release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at Dry Trail Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving full inventory of the propane storage tank.  Under emergency conditions, it is assumed that the entire contents of the vessel (623,209 lbs) are released and ignited, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.7 mile.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances was not considered at this plant since there are no receptors within the 1 psi overpressure of the WCS.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental prevention program in place at this plant.  Because processes at the ga"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have acesss to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives included forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDry Trail Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written proceedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nDry Trail Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant primarily uses the What-if/Checklist method for identifing hazards.  Secondarily, the hazard analysis and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique may also be used.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and re-evaluates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Proceedures\n\nDry Trail Plant maintains written proceedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed for accuracy.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, Dry Trail Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper and lower limit exceedances for specific process and equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operators is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstrations) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is required to be conducted every three years.  All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nDry Trail Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergencyresponse plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
