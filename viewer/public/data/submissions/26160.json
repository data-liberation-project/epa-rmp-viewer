      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nThe management and employees of the Western Farm Service (WFS) facility located at 265 N. Arboleda Drive, Merced, California 95340 are committed to the prevention of any release of chemicals handled at the facility.  If a release should occur, WFS Merced will work with the Hazardous Material team of the Merced County Fire Department, the Merced County Fire Department, the Merced County Environmental Health Department, other agencies and private emergency response contractors to control, contain and clean up the release.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at WFS Merced is the storage and sale of liquid and dry fertilizers and pre-packaged and bulk agricultural chemicals to growers and ranchers.  WFS Merced has a number of trucks that deliver liquid and dry fertilizers and pre-packaged chemicals to the end users.  Pre-packaged pesticides are stored in two warehouses located on site.  A tank farm exists for storage of liquid fertilizers and bulk chemicals.  The tank farm is located within an impervious secondary containment area on site.  The facility has a service shop that fabricates equipment for use in grower fields and services and repairs existing equipment and vehicles.  The facility operates a small number of tractors that cultivate cropland and, in a few instances, apply pesticides.  There are approximately 20 employees working at the facility - one facility manager, an operations coordinator, two administrative clerks, four tractor drivers, four truck drivers, four crop consultants, two field supervisors, a shop mechanic and a tank farm operator.\n\nThe facility stores and handles two regulated chemicals - Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck into one 12,100 gallon pressurized storage tank.  It is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.  It is also used at the facility for the production of Aqua Ammonia.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia st"

      "SummaryText": "ored at any one time is 51,000 pounds.\n\nAqua Ammonia (25% Anhydrous Ammonia by weight) is produced and stored at the facility.  It is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.  Aqua Ammonia is produced by mixing water with Anhydrous Ammonia.  There are two above-ground storage tanks - one 30,000-gallon and one 25,000-gallon at the site.  The maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia stored on site is 412,500 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight is 103,125 pounds [412,500#  x  25% Anhydrous Ammonia  =  103,125# ammonia].\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWFS Merced consulted the EPA publication Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis during preparation of the release scenarios.  WFS Merced used RMP*Comp? (software developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration & EPA) to perform the endpoint calculations.\n\nA.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the release of all contents from the Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank when filled to the greatest amount.  This would be a release of 51,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Administrative controls (operating procedures) are used at WFS Merced to preclude exceeding 82% capacity.  The release scenario has offsite impact.  The distance to the end-point of 200 ppm would be 3.4 miles.  \n\nB. Anhydrous Ammonia Alternate Release Scenario\nThe alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia (i.e., what is more likely to occur and based on the PHA) is a release of Anhydrous Ammonia due to a 1?-inch transfer hose separating during a transfer activity.  This would be a release of 721 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The release scenario has offsite impact.  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm would be .30 miles.\n\nC.  Aqua Ammonia Alternate Release Scenario\nThe alternate release scenario for Aqua Ammonia (i.e., what is more"

This would be a release of 5700 pounds of Aqua Ammonia.  The release scenario has offsite impact.  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm would be .20 miles.\n\nD. Regulated Pesticide Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nCalARP worst-case and alternative release scenarios for Table 3 Regulated Pesticides were not modeled.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWFS Merced has implemented provisions of the following regulations:\n-- National Electrical Code\n-- Uniform Fire Code\n-- Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI K 61.1, 1989, American National Standard Institute, Inc.\n-- Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\n-- Title 8, CCR 5189, Process Safety Management of Hazardous Materials (PSM)\n-- Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\n-- Title 29, CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Response Plan and Fire Prevention Plans\n-- Title 29, CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia or Aqua Ammonia at WFS Merced that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nWFS Merced has prepared and implemented an emergency action plan that meets state and federal regulations.  The emergency action plan specifies the lines of authority, the roles and responsibilities various individuals are to assume during an emergency.  The emergency action plan includes procedures to follow for fires, explosions, medical emergencies, spills and releases and natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding.  The plan includes procedures"

      "SummaryText": " for evacuating employees.  Included in the emergency action plan are written procedures specific to responding to releases of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Emergency drills are peri-odically conducted and critiqued.\n\nTwo employees at WFS Merced have been trained to the 24-Hour Technician Level under Cal-OSHA regulations [8 CCR 5192(q)].  These employees complete annual 8-Hour Refresher training.\n\nWFS Merced has presented training on Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia to the Hazardous Materials team of the Merced County Fire Department and staff members of the Merced County Department of Public Health.  In addition, the Fire Department conducts inspections of the facility periodically.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDuring the preparation of this RMP, a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on the processes involving Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  During that PHA, additional measures were realized that mitigate or eliminate the occurrence of a release.  These measures are scheduled for completion by July 30, 2002."
