      "SummaryText": "Coastal States Crude Gathering Company\nHidalgo Terminal\nRMP Executive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCoastal States Crude Gathering Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the loading of propane and butane product.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include butane and propane which are loaded into trucks and sold as commercial and residential fuels.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our truck product loading facility.  In this scenario 253,618 lb. of Propane is released.  The release quantity has included 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.51 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nAn additional worst case"

      "SummaryText": " release scenario for Program 2 flammables, involving a catastrophic release from our truck product loading facility, is also included in the RMP.  In this scenario 126,809 lb. of Butane is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 100% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 flammable substances involves a release from our truck product loading facility.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 1,512 lb. of Propane released in approximately 30 seconds.  This time element is the conservative estimation of time an operator would incur in recognizing the problem and initiating an emergency shutdown (ESD).  Passive mitigation controls such as fire monitors and gas detection are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHidalgo Terminal maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/20/2000.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hidalgo Terminal maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHidalgo Terminal has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHidalgo Terminal carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Hidalgo Terminal to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
