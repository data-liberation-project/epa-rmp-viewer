Floodgate Rd., Freeport, TX, in Brazoria County. This  summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plans requirements under the Section (r) of the Clean Air Act.  The facility contains or has the potential to contain 2500 pounds or more chlorine. The volume of chlorine on site is normally 4000 pounds.\n\nThis plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the possible hazard zone under the Worst Case Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario as required by the Clean Air Act RMP requirements in section (r) for program 3 facilities.  These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario and the area that will need to either be evacuated or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place.\n\nPSG takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine gases that could affect either their employees, nearby business and the public.  The precautions include on site alarm systems to warn employees of a release, an automatic communication system that notifies PSG personnel and emergency 911 operators of a chlorine.  The 911 operators will notify the local HazMat team.  PSG personnel will assess the leak and ,if possible, stop the leak.  If the leak is not controllable it the HazMat Team will take control of the release response.\n\nThe most probable type of releases may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the chlorine lines.  PSG keeps a  chlorine\"B\" kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on small leaks. This is to be done in conjunction with the Freeport Fire Department and Chemical Emergency Response Contractors (C.A.R.E.) contacted by the fire department.  All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the anticipated types of leaks are available on site.  Further, PSG personnel audit the facility to maintain emergency eq"
