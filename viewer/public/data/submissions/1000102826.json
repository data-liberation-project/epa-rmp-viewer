We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38. We have provided state and local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our LEPC to ensure they conform to the community plan(s). We actively encourage local emergency responder participation in our anhydrous ammonia training programs so they may be aware of what might be expected if responding to an incident at our site.\n\nPlanned Changes to Safety:\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at all of our facilities. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nFor additional information, contact:\nName: Doran Burmood\nPhone: 402-469-6452"

Valves are protected by self-closing excess flow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used for application equipment. The distance to endpoint is determined by EPA\u0092s RMP Comp Program.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in  the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard K61.1-1989 \u0093Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u0094 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111 \u0093Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u0094. We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and have installed safety equipment, including, but not limited to: excess flow valves, breakaway couplers at risers, emergency shutoff valves, collision protection barriers, and locks to limit unauthorized access to product. We also maintain routine contact with our local emergency responders and encourage and participate in training related to anhydrous ammonia. Our company has an Emergency Action Plan for employee, customer, and visitor protection in the event of fire, explosion, tornado, or other incident that may require evacuation and/or emergency medical care. Emergency contact information is included in the plan, as well as evacuation routes and assembly points. The primary emergency coordinator is listed in the Registration Section of this document. Any of the following additional individuals may be contacted in the event the primary emergency coordinator cannot be reached: \nName:\t\t\t\tWork Phone:\t\t\t24 hour Phone:\nMitch Woeste\t\t\t402-744-0694\t\t308-991-2818\n\nFive Year Accident His"

In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local emergency response personnel and other appropriate authorities to best mitigate the incident and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS Code 115111, \u0093Support Activity for Crop Production\u0094. We provide agricultural inputs for crop production that include storing anhydrous ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the spring and fall of the year. During the balance of the year there is minimal product transfer occurring. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be one nurse tank with a maximum capacity of 900 gallons.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \u0093as needed\u0094 basis with staff present only during receiving and product delivery. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2080 hour requirement to qualify as a \u0093full time employee\u0094 on site, therefore item number 1.11 is \u0093Zero\u0094. Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times during the day and night. Time spent on these inspections is not calculated in our staffing hours.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\nThe worst case release scenario is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest anhydrous ammonia nurse tank. The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA\u0092s RMP Comp Program (Version 1.07), and possible publ"
