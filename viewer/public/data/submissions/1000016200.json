In keeping with this commitment, the ITP facility has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify, control, and eliminate potential release of hazardous chemicals and exposures to employees, community, and the environment.  In addition, this risk Management Program includes accidental release prevention and emergency response plans and procedures. This Safety Management System and philosophy embodies and employs the spirit and intent of the concepts found in the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and  other applicable regulatory standards ,including those implemented by a sister company, Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc. \n\nThe major chemical that the ITP Ottawa facility uses to manufacture an inorganic chemical is liquid Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4), and the facility itself, as a A?Basic Inorganic Chemical ManufacturingA? facility,  is included within  NAICS # 325188.  The inventory quantities of Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) retained on site is in excess of the EPA threshold of 2,500 lbs, and if released, would impact the local community.  Based upon these criteria, the ITP Ottawa facility is subject to the requirements of EPAA?s RMP Program 3, which imposes OSHAA?s Standard 1910.119 for Process Safety Management.\n\n.\nThe goal of the Plant Safety Management System is to control potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, impacts to local community and the environment, and process incidents and breaches of security. \n\nIn support of this goal, the plant design and construction were performed to the most strict industry and code standards (ASME, ASCE, NFPA, NEC, Crist"

The facilityA?s policies include that safe procedures be used to handle titanium tetrachloride, that adequate safety devices and systems are designed and constructed into the facility and that all pertinent personnel be adequately trained in safe procedures.  Although the ultimate responsibility for safety and loss prevention at this location rests with the Plant Manager, specific safety responsibilities are assigned to all levels of management.  All employees are expected to perform their work safely and to recognize that working safely is a condition of employment.A? \n\n\"There is no activity or job at the ITP Ottawa Facility that is so important or urgent that it must be done at the jeopardy of the safety or health of any employee or contractor, the local community, or at the risk of damaging the environment.

The covered process is the patented \"Armstrong Process (trademarked process),\" for the low-cost production of high-purity titanium and titanium alloy powders. The detailed process design and operating procedures for this process are proprietary.  This process handles one chemical included on the EPA regulated list, namely titanium tetrachloride (CAS Number 7550-45-0).  Titanium Tetrachloride liquid is shipped to ITP in rail cars and/or truck trailers, and is transferred via pump from rail car/truck to a main steel storage tank.  The main storage tank resides within a building with a controlled environment.  All transfer pipe used in Titanium Tetrachloride service is of welded metal construction (except for some pumps and serviceable equipment).  Where bolt-up connections occur, the flanges are wrapped with suitable covers. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) liquid is pumped from the rail car to the main storage tank, and separate pumps transfer liquid from the main storage tank to a vaporizer where the liquid is converted to a vapor.  Then the vapor is pressure transferred forwarded to a reactor area where it is pre-heated and then to the reactor where it is  mixed with a reducing agent to produce pure titanium metal powder (Ti).  Similarly, Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) is reacted with a reducing agent and other metal chlorides to produce pure titanium alloy metal powder (Ti-M1-M2).  Once the reaction has occurred, the Titanium Tetrachloride and other metal chlorides are completely consumed. The powder and intermediates are further processed to remove by-product residuals from the Ti / Ti alloy materials, and prepared for packaging / shipping.  \n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nRMP regulations require performing a consequence analysis for one worst case release scenario, estimated to present the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint.
