It is this facility's policy to adhere to all Federal, State and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Knoxville Fire Department (Station #18) and Knox County Emergency Management Agency (LEPC), as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad and the University of Tennessee Medical Center (Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center) via 911.  This facility currently maintains trained incipient fire response and hazardous material first responder - operations level, and incident command personnel to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Knoxville Terminal is a refined petroleum product storage and transfer facility including storage, pipelines and truck loading racks, in addition to the butane blending system (truck and railcar offloading and storage; actual blending occurs off-site).  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system only including two 60,000-gallon (water capacity) storage tanks, railcar storage incidental to offloading (up to nineteen cars capacity) and associated piping.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the butane blending system's 60,000-gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed by system controls (85% by volume) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate scenario (based on probability and severity of an occurrance) is a BLEVE incident of one of the 60,000 gallon tanks filled to 85% capacity.\n\nThe Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals - Knoxville Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D - Program Level"

Additionally, this Plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements for highly hazardous chemicals (29 CFR Part 119), the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development and the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.  This butane system is designed, constructed and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for liquefied petroleum gas.\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving the butane system which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Knoxville Terminal butane system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Knoxville Fire Department (Station #18) and request their assistance.  Additionally, the neighboring Motiva Enterprises Terminal will be contacted.  The facility maintains a trained incipient fire and hazardous material response group, as referenced above.  The facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Knoxville Fire Department and Knox County LEPC.  The Knoxville Fire Department is aware of the facility's butane system and available fire suppression systems."
