The properties of this material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal & State of California rules and regulations.  These include EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40CFR Part 68), OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 29CFR 1910.119), California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP, 19 CCR 2735-2785), and Cal / OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 8CCR 5189) as well as regulations referenced by these or incorporated because of the nature of the chemical.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle the ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics is a wholesale food distribution warehouse.  It stores bare root trees, and plants, frozen food products for fast food chains and microwave meals and other products in over 3 million cubic feet of current storage space with the capacity of storing in excess of 30 million pounds of products in spaces from -20 degrees to 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the three (3) refrigeration systems at the warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia at the site is completely contained within the three (3) closed loop systems at all times and should never need to be refilled with replacement ammonia at any time under normal operating conditions.  An estimated 44,474 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized within the three (3) refrigerat"

The receipt, storage, and handling of the ammonia  is considered a part of one complete process.\r\n\r\n3.0 Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe areas affected by a release of ammonia have been calculated and are part of the RMP.  They have not been included in the executive summary at the direction of the EPA due to homeland security considerations.\r\n\r\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nCCL complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The hazardous materials management and safety programs implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n5.0 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been two (2) incidents involving the release of ammonia within the past five years at the facility. Release number one of 95.3 lbs. in 2 hours occurred January 31, 2014 and was due to human error when performing manual defrost of an evaporator unit. The fire department called for shelter in place of local residents. The release triggered three separate calls related to a resultant relief valve failure to re-seat. No on-site or offsite injuries or deaths resulted from the release. Release number two of 29.3 lbs. in 8 hours occurred February 1, 2014 and was due to a union leak in a PRV vent line.  An $260,000 loss of stored product occurred. No on-site or offsite injuries or deaths resulted from the release.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for each of these releases extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source. \r\n\r\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nCCL is a non-responding facility.  The Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Yuba City Fire Department at the evacua"

The Sutter County Environmental Health Division incorporates this response into the County Area Plan.\r\n\r\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCCL has made changes to the system since the last RMP updated.  These include a water diffusion tank, upgraded compressors and new piping.  Work continues to upgrade system equipment.  The rooms affected by the 2014 releases have resulted in the evaporator coils in the rooms being replaced and all relief valve piping to these four rooms being rerouted to the diffusion tank.  This was captured in a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed in 2014.  There are commitments to be made from the PHA that will be implemented at this facility for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the RMP to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated substance in the regulated process of the refrigeration system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
