ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nAt Honeysuckle White, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Honeysuckle White strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Ozark Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing and production of turkey and poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 26,000 pounds.  We have the capacity for 32,5000 pounds but our written policy limits our storage to 80% of total capacity.\n\n\n 3.

      "SummaryText": "TERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our largest receiver.  Honeysuckle White policy restricts the maximum capacity of this 14,210 pound tank to 80% of capacity.  The greatest amount stored in that tank is 14,210 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source.  \nDistance to endpoint: 1.3 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or the monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 2,535 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  .17 miles (or 294 yards)\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTo date, this Honeysuckle White facility has had no reportable releases.  \n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Mr. Randall Horn, Plant Manager.  Mr. Horn will administrate in conjunction with the Honeysuckle White management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Ozark Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM A ND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe Honeysuckle White facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written tests and are able to demonstrate "
