Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n    The facility uses aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The facility also utilizes Liquid Propane Gas (LPG) which is considered a flammble substance by EPA. The same properties that make aqueous ammonia and LPG valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle aqueous ammonia and LPG, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n    The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potential affected neighbors.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n    One 6,400 gallon aqueous ammonia tank is utilized in the latex glove manufacturing process.  The tank is filled periodically from an outside vendor.  One 30,000 gallon LPG tank is located onsite.  LPG is used as a backup fuel for firing of production drying ovens and boilers generating process heat.\n    Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized manage-ment personnel and authorized contractors.   The regulate substances handled at this facility are aqueous ammonia and LPG.  The total inventory of aqueous ammonia stored at this plant is 48,096 pounds.  The total inventory of LPG stored at this plant is 110,000 pounds.\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distance "

      "SummaryText": "for each reported scenario\n\nAQUEOUS AMMONIA 30%\n\n    Worst-Case Scenario - A catastrophic rupture of the ammonia tank would release 48,096 pounds of aqueous ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as liquid.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l is 0.10 miles.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario - A six square inch rupture occurs in the transfer hose.  The release occurs in a diked area inside the building.  There is a liquid release.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l is 0.1 miles.  This release does not have the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\nLIQUIFIED PROPANE GAS (LPG)\n\n    Worst-Case Scenario - A vapor cloud explosion of the LPG tank would release 110,000 pounds of LPG.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 2.1 % LFL is 0.40 miles.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario - A three square inch rupture occurs in the liquid space of the tank.  The release results in a vapor cloud fire.  The height of the column above the leak is 48 inches.  The distance to the endpoint of 2.1 % LFL is 0.10 miles.  This release does not have the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\n    This distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n    Routine maintenance and component checks will be performed monthly to insure safety and performance of the system.\n\n5.
