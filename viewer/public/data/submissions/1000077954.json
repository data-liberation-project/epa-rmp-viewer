The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC owned activities at this facility.\n\n\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC.'s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Description\n\n\n\nTYSON FRESH MEATS, INC operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility, and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  TYSON FRESH MEATS, INC. operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, tallow, and other rendered products.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\n\n\nFour chemicals are utilized or generated at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are chlorine (in two separate processes), ammonia (in two separate processes), methane and hydrogen sulfide.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to treat water and wastewater; ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout"
