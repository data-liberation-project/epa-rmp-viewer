      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe City of Santa Monica operates the Arcadia Water Treatment System to disinfect existing groundwater supplies.  The City's senior management is committed to offer superior service while maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. \n\nThe City of Santa Monica maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The City also has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Arcadia Water Treatment System is located at 1228 South Bundy Drive.  The facility is situated approximately 2 miles southwest of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and approximately 2 miles northwest of the Santa Monica Municipal Airport.  The intersection of the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) and Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) is approximately three miles southeast  of the facility.  The immediate area is primarily residential.  Wilshire Boulevard is lined with commercial business and office buildings north of the facility.  Saltair Avenue and Texas Avenue define the eastern and southern borders, respectively, and are residential areas.\n\nThe Arcadia Water Treatment System utilizes a chlorine gas injection process to disinfect existing groundwater supplies.  The system con"

      "FacilityID": 31452,
      "SummaryText": "sists of two one-ton chlorine containers, two vacuum regulators, two moisture trap/chlorine filters, five v-notch chlorinators, and five chlorine injectors.  The vacuum operated system utilizes the vacuum created at the injector to maintain a vacuum in the entire system.  The subsequent vacuum on the v-notch chlorinator regulates the volume of gas received from the vacuum regulator.  The vacuum regulators and heaters are mounted directly to the gas outlet valve on the one-ton containers.  The vacuum regulators require a minimum vacuum pressure to operate, therefore a break in a vacuum line will automatically shut down the system.  All chlorine equipment is located  in the chlorination building.  After leaving the injectors, the chlorine is in solution and is not of concern.  This system is also configured to handle 150-pound cylinders as the source.\n\nThe Arcadia Water Treatment System stores a maximum of 2 one ton chlorine containers and ten 150-pound chlorine cylinders (5,500 lbs) in the chlorine storage room.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCity of Santa Monica has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are two mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensors / detectors and 2) alarms.  The chlorine sensors that trigger visual alarm are located in the chlorine storage room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine alarm system will notify operators of the chlorine leak through the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Arcadia"

      "SummaryText": " Water Treatment System's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable releases over the last five years (March 1999 through March 2004).  The facility's accident history was investigated as a result of updating the Hazard Assessment study (March 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Santa Monica has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe City of Santa Monica maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of Santa Monica employees. The City of Santa Monica performs periodic emergency evacuation drills to ensure that all employees are familiar with the evacuation routes and assembly areas. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of Santa Monica Water Reclamation Plant responsible person, Mr. Robert Harvey at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe City of Santa Monica has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department Station #37.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, its is the policy of City of Santa Monica to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation (April 2004) provided mitigation measures "

The PHA was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine system since the 1999 PHA revalidation, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 1999 PHA revalidation and 2002 PSM/RMP audit, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the review of chlorine checklists, and a site inspection to review seismic issues.  The changes are scheduled to be completed by October 9, 2004.\n\nIn addition the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Arcadia Water Treatment System employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n2.   Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
