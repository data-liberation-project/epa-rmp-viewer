It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Cedar Park Water Reclamation Facility is municipal wastewater treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant to kill pathogens prior to discharge of treated water.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 6,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000-pound container full of chlorine. The 10-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because a building encloses the process.  This is the equivalent of 1,100 pounds of chlorine being released. Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nA more conceivable release, although still remote, is a failure of a vacuum regulator check unit in the open position. The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute and a distance from the facility of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  However, the plant policy is to service, overhaul and replace the vacuum regulators at prescribed intervals.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Cedar Park Water Reclamation Facility is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. Facility and City personnel have conducted a com"

As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident History\nThe Water Reclamation Facility has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations were made as a result of the Water Reclamation Facility RMP. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\nBecause the Water Reclamation Facility is within close proximity to an urban area, the City of Cedar Park will investigate emergency scrubbing systems versus non-chlorine alternatives to disinfection.  In the meantime, the following steps will be taken based on the results of a detailed hazard review at the plant.\n' We have updated our operating and maintenance (O&M) procedures, and have elaborated on procedures more prone to human error.\n' We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's  O&M.\n' We will endeavor to develop and implement a chlorine supplier audit program.  For example, do they have emergency container repair kits? Do they maintain their equipment?  What is their pre-shipment inspection procedure?\n' We will procure and maintain an inventory of spare parts that are prone to failure, and replace such parts as part of a regular maintenance cycle, despite the existence or absence of apparent wear.  \n' We will ensure each maintenance technician receives all appropriate training toward his or her duties.\n' We have developed an Emergency Response Program in conjunction with the City of Cedar Park Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team, Fire Department, and the"
