The Refinery occupies approximately 63 acres of land located in the city of Paramount in Southern California. The site is bordered on the north by Contreras Street, on the south by Somerset Boulevard and Southern Pacific Railroad track, on the east by Lakewood Boulevard and on the west by Downey Avenue. On the north side of the refinery, a trailer park, a shopping center, Wirtz Elementary School and single-family houses are located. On the west side, Paramount High School and a housing development are located. On the east side, there are single-family homes and mobile home development.  Across the railroad tracks on the south side is an apartment complex. \r\n\r\nThe primary business of the Paramount Refinery is the processing of local crude oils to finished hydrocarbon products, primarily asphalts for road construction and roofing materials, as well as reformulated gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD).  The present rated capacity of the refinery is 55 KBPD of crude.\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP requirements (40 CFR Part 68).  PPC - Paramount Refinery is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The PPC - Paramount Refinery staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, during the petroleum refining process.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\r\nPPC - Paramount Refinery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered processes.  PPC - Paramount Refinery policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED S"

In addition, there are hazardous substances that are utilized in or generated by the process. \r\nAqueous Ammonia (19%), Hydrogen sulfide and Sulfur dioxide are also present in the refinery.  However, the threshold quantity of these materials is not exceeded in any process. \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary for Toxics\r\nThe use of toxic materials at the Paramount Refinery is not encompassed by the federal RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \r\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary for Toxics\r\nThe use of toxic materials at the Paramount Refinery is not encompassed by the federal RMP requirements.

No injuries occurred due to this incident.  The second reportable release occurred on April 22nd, 2009 at 9:40 PM.  H-101/102 tripped due to high box pressure and the pilot and main burners were tripped.  The Operators reset the burner gases without purging the heater box or measuring the LEL.  Then they attempted to light the H-101 pilots which ignited and detonated.  One operator was taken to the hospital but released later in the evening.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nParamount Petroleum is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for its employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The prevention of accidents, injuries, fires, emergency releases and other emergency situations is of utmost importance and shall be the first priority for all persons working at the refinery. \r\nIt is anticipated that accidents, injuries and emergency situations may still occur. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) will provide guidelines for a coordinated emergency management system in the refinery to respond to such situations.  The ERP utilizes proven techniques of the Incident Command System.  When situations dictate, the system will utilize the combined effort from all departments, mutual aid groups and municipal agencies in order to mitigate emergency incidents in a safe, effective and timely manner.  The ERP includes:\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Alarm Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tEvacuation Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tSafety and Health Considerations\r\n\u00bf\tNotification Procedures\r\nThe ERP is implemented through an Incident Command System (ICS). The ICS has two levels of application.  Small emergencies are responded to by an Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of a Shift Incident Commander, Team Leader, and a team of members responsible for coordinating issues related to offsite releases, rescue, and hazardous materials"

The Shift Incident Commander also coordinates with the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) via telephone. \r\nFor larger emergencies the Director of Safety and Process Safety Management serves as the Incident Commander. An Emergency Management Team (EMT) may also be activated to assist, which is lead by the Vice President of Refining.  Other members of the EMT are members of the refinery senior management. The ERT, which may have initially responded to the emergency, relinquishes incident management to the Director of Safety and Process Safety Management when the latter assumes command and then provides support to the EMT. The Director of Safety and Process Safety Management communicates with the LACoFD and other outside agencies by telephone.
