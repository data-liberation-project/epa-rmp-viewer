Our operation will strive to protect plant personnel and equipment, which in turn will protect the community and the environment.  \n\nOperational excellence will be achieved through strict adherence to policies and procedures, which are available electronically to all employees.  Our employees are encouraged and empowered to identify potential hazards in the workplace and take prompt action to mitigate and/or resolve the issue.  In addition to traditional paper-based systems, Raven may equip its operators with intrinsically safe equipment to help facilitate the documentation of the issues identified and actions taken.  Raven is utilizing a software package (BasicSafe) that is used by a number of similar facilities to help track, monitor and manage process safety.  Please see https://www.basicsafe.us/ for additional information regarding BasicSafe.  As such, Raven is leveraging the modern computer programs with its traditional operator training programs.  Documentation in the software systems as well as other documentation collected is reviewed by management to ensure no additional actions are required.  The use of technology in addition to traditional programs also ensures that operators and maintenance employees have access to procedures and operating information thereby reducing errors that may lead to unsafe conditions, accidents and releases.

During operations, we will rely on the Baytown Fire Department to respond to plant emergencies requiring mitigation of uncontrolled releases or fires involving hazardous substances.  Raven attends the Greater Baytown - Chambers County LEPC meetings and holds open communications with city managers and officials.  \n\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled \nThe Raven Facility operates one 1/4th mile natural gas pipeline and two 2.5-mile pipelines for Ethylene and Butene-1 respectively as well as an 100,000 ton/yr nameplate butene-1 production facility in Baytown, Texas.  The 100,000 ton/yr butene-1 facility is based on a proven design from a technology licensor that is used in a number of similar facilities globally.  The butene-1 facility is designed and built based on a lump sum turn key EPC contract with a third-party service provider.  The ethylene raw material is supplied to the facility via one of the two 2.5 mile pipelines.  If required, the ethylene is dried to remove excess contaminants and then mixed in one of two reactor trains with alkyl catalyst to produce butene-1, a comonomer primarily used in the production of polyethylene.  A byproduct of the reaction produces hexenes and heavier components (C6+).  The reactor effluent, containing unreacted ethylene, butene-1, C6+ and deactivated catalyst is routed to the separation system where it is segregated into four individual streams using vaporizers, thin film evaporators and simple distillation.

It has been automated and controlled to reduce reliance on human input thereby reducing human error.  The process parameters (pressure, temperature, flow, level, etc.) are monitored utilizing modern control system that alerts the operator to certain process changes.  Additionally, it is interlocked with the process to place the facility in a safe state if predefined operational limits are reached.  The Raven employees are equipped with intrinsically safe equipment such as radios, gas detectors, etc. to help facilitate the safe operations and maintenance of the facility.  \n\nRaven has developed a Process Safety program utilizing the industry experience of its employees and modern software from a service provider that provides similar solutions to other production facilities.

The operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they reflect current operating practices, including changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and facilities. To guard against outdated or inaccurate operating procedures, the procedures are certified annually to validate that these operating procedures are updated, current and accurate.\nTraining:\nTraining provides employees, including contractor employees, with an understanding of the nature and causes of problems arising from process operations and increases employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to the process.  An effective training program significantly reduces the likelihood and severity of incidents arising from process operations and is instrumental in preventing small problems from leading to a catastrophic release, accidents or events.  Employees receive initial training on the process and will receive refresher training every 3 years.  All training is documented in the training module of the BasicSafe system.\nAll employees, including contractor employees, involved in operating the process are covered by this policy and procedure.  This part identifies the minimum training requirements for personnel involved in operating the process.  Training for maintenance personnel is addressed in the Mechanical Integrity section of the manual.  \nContractors:\nContractors will play a role in the facility and the work that occurs.  There is an application, review, and monitoring process for all contractors whose activities have potential to impact process safety.  The process will involve both regular Raven employees and contractor personnel working together to ensure safety performance, safety programs, notification, and training are adequate to facilitate a safe working environment.  The company will also periodically evaluate contractor performance and will maintain training and injury documentation.  Additionally, ther"

The PSSR will be documented inside the MOC in the BasicSafe system.  The PSSR checks to ensure that all the required changes were implemented as designed, all required PSI has been updated and all required training has been completed. The PSSR will be completed prior to the commissioning and startup of Raven.   In addition, PSSR will also be implemented if required in relation to future MOC before the equipment/process impacted by the change is restarted.\nAdditionally, a PSSR will be performed prior to initial startup or startup following a shut down for maintenance of the facility.  The PSSRs after the initial startup will typically only be performed only for the portions of the system that have had maintenance performed.  If the entire facility is shut down and cooled down in relation to a maintenance / MOC, a complete PSSR will be performed.  The PSSRs for Raven will be executed as an operating procedure and there will be a verification that all instrumentation and critical equipment are functional prior to re-introducing highly hazardous chemicals into the process if the relevant hazardous chemicals where removed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Mechanical Integrity (MI) program describes the policies, plans, and procedures for maintaining the ongoing mechanical integrity of equipment at the facility.  The purpose of the MI program is to assure that equipment used in the processing, storage, and handling of highly hazardous chemicals is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases, accidents and unplanned events.  The MI program provides written procedures, training, inspection and testi"

Please see https://www.emaint.com/ for additional information regarding eMaint.  Any piece of equipment that meets the criteria to be included in the MI program will be designated as such.\nHot Work\nHot work permitting is used to establish safe work practices for control of ignition sources to reduce the likelihood of fires and/or explosions resulting from improper hot work operations. Hot work is defined as any work or use of equipment that may introduce a source of ignition in an area where flammable materials or vapors may be present. The Hot Work Permit is found in the Permit Tool section of BasicSafe.\nA permit must be issued prior to hot work operations in or near any process areas. The permit will be issued for a specific task on specific equipment. The employee or contractor conducting any type of hot work must request a Hot Work Permit in the control room. If Hot Work can be moved to a non-process area, such as the workshop, this should be considered first.  Note that Raven will take over the responsibility for Safety in regards to hot work at Mechanical Completion and that there are no plants to bring in large amounts of ethylene or butene-1 to the facility prior to Mechanical Completion.\n\nManagement of Change:\nAll modifications or changes (other than \"replacement in kind\") to the process is managed through a module in BasicSafe.  The system defines responsibilities, steps for assessing risks and approving changes, requirements for reviewing designs for temporary and permanent changes, steps needed to verify that modifications have been made as designed, time limit authorizations for temporary changes, and steps for organizational and emergency changes.

If a change covered by these procedures results in a change in the required process safety information, such information also must be updated accordingly. If a change covered by these procedures changes the required operating procedures or practices, they also must be updated.\nIncident Investigation:\nIncident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and implementing the steps and \"lessons learned' to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. The desired outcomes of an incident investigation are: the identification of the contributing factors and root causes of the incident; recommendations for changes in practices and/or facilities to mitigate the likelihood of future occurrence; and, communication of incident reports and resulting changes to affected personnel.  \n\nAll personnel are responsible for the timely reporting of any incident observed, including \"near misses\". This includes contractors, temporary workers and visitors to the site. Training material is provided for all new employees at time of arrival on site. The training for new employees provides a comprehensive overview of the Incident Tool located in BasicSafe. The Incident tool is used for all incident investigation reporting.  A system to promptly address and resolve the incident findings and recommendations has been established including documenting resolutions and corrective actions.
