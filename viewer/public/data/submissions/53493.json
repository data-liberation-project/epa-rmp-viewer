      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor).  The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 17000 E. Highway 120 in Ripon, California, which is on the 120 Highway and approximately 5 miles east of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with farmland and residential areas.\n\nAmmonia Systems\n\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of grape juice, wine, and distilled spirits.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 94,524 pounds of ammonia in its three independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  Three Chiller Groups (A, B, and C) each contain the following charge of ammonia: 23,268 pounds, 35,628 pounds, and 35,62"

The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chillers, and suction accumulator, and Glycol Circulation System and Tank Jacket Heat Exchangers/Coolers), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide glycol refrigeration.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\n\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. transfers sulfur dioxide from a one-ton containers, located at three filling stations throughout the winery to smaller hand-held sulfur dioxide containers ranging from 6-pound to 100?pound cylinders.  Each one-ton container has a maximum capacity of 2,000 pounds.  The first and second filling stations each hold one one-ton container of sulfur dioxide.  Two of the filling stations only utilize a single one-ton container and therefore are under the EPA reporting threshold.  The third filling station utilizes a single one-ton container at the filling station, but has up to three one-ton containers in storage, collocated such that they are considered one system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Managemnet Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle sulfur dioxide and ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n? Process safety information is provided"

In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n? Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n? Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n? Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n? Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n? A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n? A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n? A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety.  The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accients.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince January 2003 to the present, there have been no accidents or releases of regulated substances from covered processes that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such ?RMP accidents? would involve serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, prop"

(Franzia Ripon) realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and are internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\nAmmonia Systems\n\nAn investigation into the facility?s accident history showed that there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. However, the facility had an incident on September 2004 which caused a release of approximately 85 pounds of ammonia from the Chiller #10, in FES-B.  The facility supervisor, Marvin Pater, hosed down the area with water to control the ammonia fumes in the area and attempted to make contact with the Refrigeration Supervisor, Troy Weis and Maintenance Manager, Kevin Baskin.  The leak stopped later on that night (11:40 pm).  Investigation and repair was performed the following day, which Troy determined the valve is in good operating condition as of 9/11/2004.\n\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\n\nThe facility has had no significant releases of sulfur dioxide over the past five years (September 2003 ? September 2008) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a sulfur dioxide release, nor any releases or ?near misses? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRipon is a ?responding? facility with First Responder ? Technician Level training (24-hr initial and 8-hr annual refresher). This training includes ammonia release emergency response and donning a respirator.  The facility is also included in the community emergency respo"

The Incident Commander will contact 911, Plant Manager, and Maintenance Supervisor. The plan is to incorporate personnel from the Fire Department and appropriate TWG responders.  The rest of the employees will be evacuated from the facility to a designated area.  The Fire Department and appropriate TWG responders will take over the role as Incident Commander upon arrival.  A Business Plan has been submitted to San Joaquin County, which contains the required elements discussed above and emergency response has been coordinated with the local Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChemical safety is an important part of The Wine Group, Inc. facility located in Ripon, California.  The Health and Safety committee as well as regulatory requirements have minimized chemical exposure risks to employees and the public through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts.  For example, as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), vehicle barriers were installed around the ammonia processes and detailed procedures were documented.  \n\nSubsequent to the submittal of the RMP Update drafted in 2004, an automatic notification system was added to the plant?s programmable computer system, which automatically pages the Maintenance Supervisor (or His Designate) when there is a significant system parameter deviation at the facility.  This system modification provides the quickest response to operating deviations, providing better on-time system performance.\n\nOther improvements will be made when identified and approved by Management."
