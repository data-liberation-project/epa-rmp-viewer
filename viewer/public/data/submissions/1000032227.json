Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nInterstate Warehousing has implemented a number of programs to ensure the chemical used in our refrigeration system remains there.  First and foremost is our compliance with the OSHA mandated Process Safety Management Program (29 CFR 1910.119).  In adhering to this program, the refrigeration system is subjected to a number of periodic inspections, tests and calibrations.  Our training program ensures that all employees completing or overseeing these tasks will be adequately trained.  Beyond the preventative and predictive maintenance being conducted on the system we also have implemented an Emergency Action Plan as required by OSHAs 29 CFR 119.38 and 119.120.\n\n  \n\n2.    Facility and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe facility is a 570,000+ square foot public cold storage warehouse and employs a single stage refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as primary refrigerant.  The major components of the system include: 6 screw compressors, 3 evaporative condensers, and 51 evaporators.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia inventory in this system is estimated to be 37,900 lbs.  \n\n\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThis Interstate Warehousing facility falls under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  As mentioned above, there are a number of required inspections, tests, and calibrations that Interstate has developed based on recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The program has been largely developed based on the standards and bulletins issued by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\n4.    The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had any reportable accidental releases in the last 5 years. \n\n \n\n5.    The emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe facilities' emergency action program has been developed based on the OSHA standards, 1910."

      "SummaryText": "38 and 1910.120.  The aim of the program is to safely and effectively remove employees from potential hazards, while also minimizing any potential accidental releases and offsite consequences.  Annually the facility has members of the local fire and HAZMAT teams tour the facility for familiarization.  The facility also conducts frequent drills of varying nature to ensure all employees are prepared for any emergency event.\n\n    \n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nInterstate Warehousing is always working towards improving safety programs.  Corporate management has committed to ongoing training, periodically reevaluating current programs and attending seminars and conferences of industrial refrigeration experts in an attempt to stay on the leading edge of changes in the industry that will improve overall safety and program effectiveness.   \n\n"
