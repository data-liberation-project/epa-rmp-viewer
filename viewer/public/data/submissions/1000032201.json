If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Dalton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We do not maintain a fire brigade, but do maintain fire response equipment such as hand held fire extinguishers for small fires.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  The AMC International facility, located at 310 Brookhollow Industrial Blvd, Dalton Georgia, is operated as a contract aerosol manufacturing facility.  AMC manufactures various organic and water based solvent cleaners and pesticides as janitorial aerosol products.  Waste water generated by the operation of on-site groundwater remediation system is discharged to the Dalton Utilities sewer system after pre-treatment.   The production portion of the facility is located in the Apollo building adjacent to an aboveground storage tanks (AST) tank farm.  Production chemicals are stored in drums or totes and also within the ASTs.  Finished products are stocked in the warehouse areas and shipped off-property through the loading dock area adjacent to the warehouse.  Liquid process chemical deliveries are made directly to the tank farm via tanker truck to permanent piping systems.\n\n\n\nThe property is located off of Brookhollow Industrial Blvd and is surrounded by industrial tenants.  The primary AST storage material and transfer operations takes place in a central portion of the facility with storm water discharges also leaving this area to the south.  The facility operates 6 propellant tanks with tanks used for propane blends (One 18,000 gallon tank for NP-70, One 18,000 gallon tank for NP-85, One 9,000 gallon tank for NP-46, One 6,500 gallon tank for A-108), one 5,500 gallon tanks for DME,"

      "SummaryText": " and a single 28,000 gallon tank for CO2.  These tanks are located in the central courtyard on the northeast side of the production plant. The approximate weight amount of propane propellants stored on site is 230,650 pounds based on 88% fill capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 18,000-gallon (approximately 73,400 pounds) propane storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance (0.3 miles) to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter transfer pipe with a 1 psi overpressure, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The pipe break could be associated with either the transfer line between the transfer pump to the actual gasser or from a line rupture between the low to high pressure pumps.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance (0.2 miles) to the endpoint.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite; there are approximately 119 public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  All release amounts, endpoint distances and receptors were modeled based on the tables provided in the EPA guidance for Propane storage facilities and using Marplot Ver 4.2.2.  Copies of the EPA Program guidance and the Marplot output figures are provided with the RMP Plan. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is intended to be designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  The tanks and equipment are designed to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\nFive-year acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident history:  In 2008, there was a fire situation that occurred due to failure of a pressure relief valve on the A-108 propane tank.  The relief valve failed and during the failure created a spark which ignited the jet of propellant.  The flame was extinguished and the tank drained.  All pressure relief valves were replaced after this incident.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Dalton Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  We have coordinated our response plans (RCRA Contingency Plan and Emergency Action Plan) with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system and conducted a joint exercise with us in past annual emergency evacuation tests.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Continue to reinforce safe practices during operational training and safety training meetings.\n\n\n\n"
