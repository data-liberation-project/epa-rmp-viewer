We have developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances. \nWe plan to meet or exceed our regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent incidents or accidents.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are regulated under the RMP requirements. \nWe have developed programs to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe primary purpose of our facility is the treatment of wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  To meet this requirement, we store chlorine in quantities up to 28 one-ton cylinders.  Typically, three chlorine cylinders are connected to a common manifold and liquid is piped through a chlorine gas evaporator, to the chlorinators where it is injected into plant process water.  This chlorine solution is used in different areas of the plant for disinfection.\nWe store sulfur dioxide i"
