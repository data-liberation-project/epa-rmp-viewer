Emergency Response Plan\nBCO-Plaq, in coordination with the Dow-LAO Emergency Services Department, carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (LEPC) is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6.

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, all BCO-Plaq employees have access to the process safety information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nBCO-Plaq hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. BCO-Plaq has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. Contractors are also required to inform BCO of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n4.Five-year Accident History\nThere has been 3 RMP-reportable accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years.\n\n-A of Chlorine occurred on 1/3/2018. No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident. Onsite, there was 1 injury. There was no onsite property damage.\n\n-A release of Chlorine occurred on 4/18/22. No deaths or injuries occurred offsite or onsite as a result of this accident. Immediate surrounding residents were advised to shelter in place during a portion of the event. There was onsite property damage caused by a fire resulting from the release. A public meeting was held to discuss the release investigation findings on 7/1/22.\n\n-A release of Chlorine occurred on 5/4/22. No deaths of injuries occurred offsite as a result of th"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at BCO-Plaq to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training prior to operating under the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at BCO-Plaq. These reviews are conducted to confirm that required design components,  construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, and training are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBCO-Plaq conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nBCO-Plaq promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What If/Checklists (combined), HAZOP-LOPA, the BCO Fire and Explosion Index, the BCO Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of less than 5 years.

The most recent PHA/update was performed on November 30, 2021.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, BCO-Plaq maintains and periodically updates written standard operating procedures (SOPs). These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBCO-Plaq has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. All new employees are provided the applicable training (initial class-room training and on-the-job mentoring), depending on the nature and location of their assignments, before they are allowed to perform on their own.

There are 8 regulated substances present at the facility that are above the threshold limits: Chloroform [Methane, trichloro-], Chlorine, Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) [Hydrochloric acid], Methyl chloride [Methane, chloro-], 2-chloropropane (isopropyl chloride), 1-chloropropylene (1-Propene, 1-chloro-), 2-chloropropylene, and propylene.\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride is produced at BCO-Plaq to be used internally to make aqueous hydrogen chloride or to be sold to customers to make silicones, some of which form computer chips. Inhalation can cause coughing, choking, inflammation and ulceration of the respiratory tract. Chlorine is a reactive element found naturally in sodium chloride (table salt). It is used to purify 98% of our nation's drinking water, is in 85% of all medicines, is used in hospital sanitation. It is a product of the Chlorine Unit and is the basic building block in the production of many of Solvent/EDC's products as well as other costumers. Some of these consumer products are laundry bleach, garden and lawn herbicides, vinyl siding for homes, and PVC piping and fittings. Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas with a strong, irritating odor. The vapor can be irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. High concentrations could cause more serious problems.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBCO-Plaq has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with BCO Loss Prevention Principles and BCO Engineering Standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the BCO-Plaq stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBCO-Plaq maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.

It is BCO-Plaq's policy to implement the necessary and appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, BCO-Plaq plant personnel, along with contracted services of the Dow Chemical Company Louisiana Operations, provide staffing of well-trained emergency response personnel that are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. BCO-Plaq is also completely coordinated with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (LEPC) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nBCO-Plaq contains 4 process units previously part of Dow-LAO. Of the 4 process units, only 2 units are RMP covered processes: Chlorine and Solvents/EDC"
