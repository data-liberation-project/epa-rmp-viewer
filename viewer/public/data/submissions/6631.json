If a release should occur, we are prepared to work with local fire department, medical agencies and law enforcement to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION - a) The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  We also blend dry bulk fertilizer for sale and custom application to farmers.  \nb) Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and sold to farmers for fertilizer for crop production.  c) The maximum quantity stored at our location would be 132,000 pounds in two storage tanks.  One tank is 18,000 gallons and the other is 12,000.  The maximum quantity handled at any time would be the unloading of a rail car holding 150,000 to 160,000 pounds.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO - The worst case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  a) The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds from our 18,000 gallon storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.  b) The alternative release scenerio based on the most likely potential release is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be 2,900 pounds in a 2 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint is .22 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - a) The facility has excess flow valves, relief valves, check valves, emergency shut off valves and manual shut off valves in place to help prevent accidental releases.  b) We have also implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA 29CFR 1910.11, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also has training and safety meetings on a r"

      "SummaryText": "egular basis.\n\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY - There has been one release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.  The release was about 4000 pounds and caused no injuries or property damage at the facility.  To our knowledge, no offsite injuries, property damage or environmental damage occurred.  The release occurred when some unknown drug dealers tried to steal from a nurse tank for the purpose of making methamphetamine.  Since this occurred, we keep all nurse tanks on the yard empty to keep this from happening again.\n\n6.  EMERGECY RESPONSE PROGRAM - The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA 29CFR 1910.38.  We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.  We have a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY - Safety improvement is an on going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nRoss Kromer\nPlant Manager"
