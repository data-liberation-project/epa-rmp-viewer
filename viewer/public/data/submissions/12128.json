Catastrophic failure of the chlorine container would be required for this scenario to occur.  Assuming pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of three parts per million (ppm) chlorine vapor, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 3.0 miles.  Table A5-1 of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, September 1998, was used for the chemical dispersion analysis.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered in the analysis.\n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, Foster Farms modeled an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance contained in a process covered by RMP regulations.  Foster Farms used an alternative chlorine release scenario described in Table 5-5 of the above referenced AWWA document.  The release scenario is described as a 5/16-inch effective diameter orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a faulty regulator or valve.  The evaluation used a maximum average sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.56 miles.\n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario for ammonia described in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998, for an ammonia release from the Complex.  The release scenario is described as a <-inch effective diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.

Of the two chlorine processes, one is a chlorine injection system and one is a chlorine container storage area.  Plant 1 has one ammonia refrigeration system and the chlorine storage area.  Plant 2 has one ammonia refrigeration system.  The Deli Plant has two ammonia refrigeration systems.  The NCDC has one ammonia refrigeration system.  All equipment is operated and maintained by a single team of trained refrigeration and chlorine systems technicians who are managed and dispatched by a single maintenance management team.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facility.  The systems provide cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, product, water chilling, and ice making.  Central computer systems monitor and control the refrigeration systems.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  The largest ammonia pressure vessel, installed at the Deli Plant, has a capacity of approximately 17,740 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nGaseous chlorine is used at Plant 2 for disinfecting.  Gaseous chlorine is injected into various water streams at the plant to maintain chlorine concentrations in water as required by the regulatory agencies governing poultry processing.  Chlorine containers are stored at a central location within the Livingston Complex prior to being deployed at the injection system location. Both 150-pound and one-ton containers are located at the chlorine storage area.\n\nThe chlorine injection system consists of a container of liquid and gaseous chlorine under pressure connected to an injection system.

A metering system controls the volume of chlorine that is injected.  The maximum amount of chlorine in a one-ton container is 2,000 pounds.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  The Foster Farms facility reported one chlorine release within the past five years.  The leak occurred in July 1995 from a valve on a one-ton chlorine container.  One minor injury was reported to a Foster Farms employee.  No off-site release occurred.  The quantity of chlorine gas released was approximately three pounds and the duration of the release was less than 30 minutes.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Foster Farms Livingston Complex due to the quantity of ammonia and chlorine used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for a facility and an alternative release scenario for each covered chemical. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \u0005the greatest amount held in a single vessel\u0005released as a gas over 10 minutes.  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\nA release of chlorine from a one-ton container results in the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint for t"

Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine injection systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\n\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in all of the systems except Plant 2 are connected to a diffusion panel.

The primary concerns are over-pressurization, physical damage to the chlorine containers and damage/ deterioration to associated piping and tubing.  Locating the chlorine storage area on a north-facing exterior wall helps to mitigate the potential for over-pressurization that may be caused by exposure to direct sunlight.  The containers located at the injection system are shaded.  \n\nThe containers at both the chlorine storage area and the chlorine injection system at the Foster Farms Livingston Complex are protected from vehicle traffic by barriers and by their location.  The potential for a significant release at the injection system due to damage to connected tubing and piping is greatly minimized by the use of vacuum regulators at the cylinders.  Additionally, flexible tubing used in the system is replaced on a regular basis.\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration and the chlorine injection systems at the facility, Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system.  Administrative controls include, but are not limited to: formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP auditing and inspection program.

The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the RMP regulations as required in the 1990 Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act.  The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The RMP regulations apply to facilities that handle, manufacture, use or store toxic and flammable substances listed in the regulations above specified threshold quantities.\n\nFoster Farms prepared a RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia and chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine injection systems at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia and chlorine handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures. and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to mitigate the release.  Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary.\n\nThe Foster Farms Livingston Complex is located at 843 Davis Street in Livingston, California.
