The total charge of the ammonia systems (combined) was calculated by refrigeration contractor, APPCO, in 2012 and found to be 55,996 pounds of ammonia (System 1 - 42,098 & System 2 - 13,898).\r\n\r\nSystem 1's refrigeration cycle begins with the collection of high pressure liquid ammonia in the High Pressure Receivers (3) from the Condensers.  The High Pressure Receivers serve as the main liquid storage vessels for system 1.  The High Pressure Receivers provide high pressure liquid ammonia to the Pre-cool Pump Package, Belt Freezer (IQF #9), Poly Bag Room Evaporators, and Intercooler.  The High Pressure Receivers also provide liquid injection, for oil cooling, to High Stage Compressors #8, #9, #10, and Booster Compressors #6 and #8.\r\n\r\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia passing through the Intercooler is provided to the Blast Cell Recirculators (2), Freezer Accumulators (3), Sure Fresh Pump Package, Berry Cool Pump Package, and when needed, system 2.  Suction from these areas is drawn off by the Booster Compressors and Suction Accumulator/Slop Tank prior to entering the High Stage Compressors.  Booster Compressor discharge is routed to the Intercooler. Suction from the Poly Bag Room passes through the Suction Accumulator/Slop Tank prior to entering the High Stage Compressors.  After a predetermined amount of liquid has accumulated in the Suction Accumulator's Transfer Unit, the Transfer Unit opens the high pressure hot gas line, forcing the accumulated liquid out of the vessel and into the High Pressure Receivers"

Senior management as well as Human Resources administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSure Fresh Produce has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Sure Fresh Produce to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine rooms.

The high pressure vapor is condensed by discharging latent heat in the ammonia to the atmosphere using sprayed water and fans.  High Stage Compressor discharge is also used for the defrosting of the Poly Bag Room, Vestibule Area (Dock), Holding Rooms, Berry Cooler Pressure Coolers/Blowers, Berry Cooler, Freezer Room #3, and Blast Cell Evaporators/Coil Units.  \r\n\r\nAn auto purger periodically purges system 1 of non-condensibles collected in the Condensers.

System 1 is also equipped with an Under-Floor Heat Exchanger which is used for heating of the freezer area floors.\r\n\r\nRefrigeration process equipment associated with system 2 does not operate continuously.

In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to atmosphere via relief lines which penetrate through the roof.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by the refrigeration contractor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, IIAR Standard 6 - 2019. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nAn unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)). \r\n\r\nFormer facility tenant, Sunrise Growers experienced a small ammonia release on October 10, 2018.

These recommendations are scheduled to be completed by September 2021.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year to help with their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Sure Fresh Produce employees.
