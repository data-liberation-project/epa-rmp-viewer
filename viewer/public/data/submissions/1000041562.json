The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level. FMI uses the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation for prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures, or equipment. The elements of the FMI's accidental release prevention program are summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company's PSM program and to a process hazard analysis. The process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of flammable compressed gases and the technology and equipment of the NGL system.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable or toxic materials. The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable or toxic materials. The PHA has been updated and can be found in Appendix J. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the process equipment are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this equipment.

An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the CalARP standards. The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the program elements are effectively implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - A crucial part of FMI's program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented. Accordingly, FMI has an incident investigation program that requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable or toxic material.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation Plan - FMI has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation, and management of these program elements.\r\n\r\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices \r\n- FMI has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. Details of both hot work and safe work practices are detailed in the PSM. \r\n\r\nContractor Safety - FMI, in following OSHA's PSM Guidelines, requires that a contractor's safety program be evaluated, that contractor employees be trained regarding potential process hazards and emergency procedures, and that appropriate records are maintained. Contractors who perform work in and around processes that involve flammable gases or liquids are certified by FMI to accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of any employee at the facility.\r\n\r\nExternal Events Analysis Information - Pursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, \u00a72745.7(q); the following"

To achieve this end, FMI strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. \r\n\r\nFMI implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue, and medical activities). Protection of the environment is also a high priority. Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Inglewood Field is located at 5640 South Fairfax Ave in metropolitan Los Angeles, seven miles west-southwest of downtown Los Angeles. The field covers most of the Baldwin Hills. These hills project above the surrounding coastal plain by 300-400 feet. The Field is located in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County, except for a small northwest portion which lies within Culver City. \r\n\r\nThe gas plant is situated near the north end of the Field. The Field is bordered in this area by the Kenneth Hahn State Recreational Area. The nearest public roadway, La Cienega Boulevard, runs through the middle of the Inglewood Field in a north-south direction. The Kenneth Hahn State Recreational Area is approximately 900 feet (.17 mile) to the north. The State Recreation Area is considered a public receptor under the RMP regulation. \r\n\r\nThe gas plant is designed to convert sweet field gas into pipeline quality sales gas and natural gas liqu"

The natural gas liquids (NGL) storage tank has a working capacity of 56,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) regulations apply to a stationary source with a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance. The two regulated substances of concern at FMI Inglewood Gas Plant are liguefied propane gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (NGLs). The CalARP threshold quantity and the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold for these substances is 10,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nThere are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities under the regulations.\r\n\r\nThe following flammable substances are present over the threshold quantity: \r\n\r\nPropane CAS # 74-98-6 ( lbs. - based on 75% working capacity)\r\nFlammable Mixture\r\nButane CAS # 106-97-8 ( lbs \u00bf based on 75% working capacity)\r\n\r\nUnder Title 19 Division 2 Chapter 4.5, Table 3 State Regulated Substances List and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention, the propane and butane threshold quantities are 10,000 pounds. \r\nUnder EPA Clean Air Act 112&reg; Title 40 CFR Part 68 Table 4 Federal Regulated Substances list and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention, the propane and butane threshold quantities are 10,000 pounds. \r\nThe quantity stored at the FMI Inglewood Gas Plant exceeds the limit for the CalARP Threshold limits.

      "SummaryText": "County Fire Department) FMI was advised to implement a Program 3 Prevention Program which includes the Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan. \r\n\r\nSummary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP and the CalARP's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes that handle flammable or toxic materials. The objective of the regulation is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals. To control these types of hazards, FMI has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within its workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective prevention program. Through compliance with the regulations and standards and with the guidance of the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the FMI Inglewood Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Prevention Program 3. \r\n\r\nAn effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process. Using this approach, the following components were considered in the evaluation in accordance with Title 19 CCR Section 2745.6 and 40 CFR part 68. \r\n\r\nThe twelve elements that make up the \r\nPrevention Program 3 are:\r\n\r\n1. Process Safety Information;\r\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\r\n3. Operating Procedures;\r\n4. Training;\r\n5. Mechanical Integrity;\r\n6. Management of Change;\r\n7. Pre-Startup Review;\r\n8. Compliance Audits;\r\n9. Incident Investigation;\r\n10. Employee Participation;\r\n11. Hot Work Permit; and\r\n12. Contractors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being subject to the CalARP requirements, FMI has been advised by the CUPA (Los Angeles County Fire Department) to implement a PSM program. Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions), FMI has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 Prevention Program. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the CalARP Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the process. Using this approach the following components"
