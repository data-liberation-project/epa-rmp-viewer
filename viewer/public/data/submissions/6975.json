The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRainbow Pool Service & Repair has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine at the Rainbow Pool Service & Repair within the last five years (June 1994 through June 1999).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Rainbow Pool Service & Repair's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Rainbow Pool Service & Repair has a B-kit and two SCBAs available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond"

This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at Rainbow Pool Service & Repair.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a What-if analysis, and a series of checklists.  The following recommendations were made during this study and will be completed by June 2000:\n\nVerify that the local HazMat team is capable to respond to a chlorine such as using a B-kit in order to stop a release.\n\nEnsure that neighboring businesses know that chlorine is on-site and to evacuate to a location upwind if a release should occur.\n\nVerify that the operating procedures are a correct prepresentation of the standard practices performed during filling.\n\nInclude a procedure that states that chlorine filling will not be performed if the scrubber is not operational.\n\nConsider installing crash posts around the ton container area that faces the trucking facility.\n\nRe-apply the chlorine health diamond to the outside gate of the facility\n\nVerify that the inspections listed in the Mechanical Integrity section are an accurate representation of those performed at the facility.\n\nInstall a wind sock that is visible from all locations\n\nVerify that evacuation routes are posted and post near doorway if necessary.\n\nInclude emergency phone numbers on telephones at the facility.\n\nPerform annual evacuations for all employees."

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nRainbow Pool Service & Repair maintains an emergency plan which provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1985.  The process is located at 4320 Armour Ave., Bakersfield, California 93308.  The chlorine system for Rainbow Pool Service & Repair consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20 pound cylinders.  Below provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine Tanks (one ton containers)\n(2 - Operational and Maximum Amount)\n\nFilling Manifold\n\nScrubber Sytem\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site for the Rainbow Pool Service & Repair is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.
