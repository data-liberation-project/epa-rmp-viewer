      "SummaryText": "Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 mandated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations to minimize the risk of accidental chemical releases.  EPA responded by publishing its Risk Management Program (RMP) rule on June 20, 1996.  The rule, codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, requires subject facilities to formulate and implement measures to reduce the risk of an accidental chemical release.  Facilities are subject to the RMP rule if they have processes utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity (TQ) of at least one of 77 air toxic or 63 flammable chemicals.\n\n    Subject facilities are required to develop and implement a RMP and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) to regulatory authorities. The RMPlan serves as a summary document of the RMP for all covered processes at the facility, and information submitted in the RMPlan will be made available for public viewing.  In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1), this document is an update of the previous RMPlan submitted to EPA in 2004.\n\n    Fort Bragg is known primarily as the ?Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces? and is home to the 82nd Airborne Division, the XVIII Airborne Corps, and Special Operations Command.  Fort Bragg is located in the southeast portion of North Carolina in Cumberland, Hoke, Harnett, Moore, Richland, and Scotland Counties.  The XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg have two processes that utilize chemicals in excess of its specified TQ.  These processes involve chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The WTP also stores and uses anhydrous ammonia to prepare the drinking water for the installation.  However, the ammonia stored at the WTP is below the TQ, and is only considered as it relates to the chlorine injection process at the WTP.\n\nBased on criteria outlined at 40 CFR 68.10, Fort Bragg has developed and impl"

      "SummaryText": "emented a Program Level 3 RMP compliant with EPA requirements for this process.  In the fall of 2006, American Water Services, a private contractor, took over the daily operations of the WTP and WWTP.  However, the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg have retained ownership of the plants and associated equipment.  The RMP for the WTP and WWTP was adopted by American Water Services on December 28, 2006.\n\nA worst-case release analysis and an alternative release analysis were performed using RMPComp, Version 1.07.  Results of the worst-case analyses indicate that the area of concern would be a 1.3 mile radius emanating from the WTP and WWTP, potentially impacting 2,900 and 4,800 people, respectively.  Results of the alternative release scenarios indicate that the area of concern would be a 0.2 mile radius emanating from the WTP and WWTP, potentially impacting 20 and 8 people, respectively.\n\nAs part of the Hazard Assessment, the five-year history of all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, must be included.  Interviews with personnel at the WTP, WWTP, Environmental Compliance Branch, and Fire Department indicate that there have been four incidents in the past five years.  However, there has been no significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths or injuries, from these incidents.  \n\nThe Risk Management Program at Fort Bragg has developed and implemented a comprehensive program to promptly respond to a toxic or flammable substance release to minimize injuries, lessen the impact to the surrounding community, minimize environmental impacts, and provide guidance to local emergency response personnel.  The main elements of Fort Bragg?s RMP (Hazard Assessment, Prevention Program 3, Emergency Response Program, and Risk Management Plan) are contained in Sections 1 - 4 of this "
