Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Stephenson Service Company are committed to the prevention of any\n\naccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\n\nprepared to work with the Winslow fire department, Stephenson County LEPC or other authorities, to\n\nmitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 9253 W. Nora Rd, Winslow, IL 61089, is the storage\n\nof fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct\n\napplication as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct\n\napplication as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of two 45,000 gallon\n\nstorage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to\n\nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 460,000 pounds, this includes\n\nthe amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks..\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive\n\ninformation it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and\n\nregulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\n\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as\n\nadopted by "

The propane facility was designed\n\nand constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our\n\nemployees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage,\n\nor environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as\n\nrequired under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n- a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including preemergency\n\nplanning and employee training.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Winslow Fire\n\nDepartment and Stephenson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency\n\naction plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the\n\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this\n\ntime."
