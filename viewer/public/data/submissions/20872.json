The Water Plant staff annually reviews and drills with its Process Hazards Analysis\n(PHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) plan and Emergency Action Plan (EAP). In addition,\nEWEB's Water Plant is annually inspected by the local emergency responders (City of\nSpringfield Fire & Safety) and used as a drill practice site.\n\nREGULATED PROCESSES\n\nThe Water Plant uses two toxic gases (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) in the processing of safe\ndrinking water. To disinfect the raw water from the McKenzie River, chlorine gas is mixed with\nwater at a concentration of up to 3.0 parts per million (ppm). After filtration, sulfur dioxide is\nused to dechlorinate the water to approximately 0.6 ppm chlorine. The levels of chlorine in the\nwater drop in the distribution system, and normally the chlorine level in residences is between\n0.2 and 0.25 ppm residual chlorine. The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires that drinking\nwater contain a minimum of 0.20 ppm residual chlorine in the distribution system.\n\nThe Hayden Bridge containment facility can hold up to twelve one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas\n(24,000 pounds) and up to four one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide (8,000 pounds).\n\nFACILITY DESIGN\n\nThe Water Plant has taken several measures to protect the public in the event of a toxic gas\nrelease. Since it started operation in 1950, there have been no releases to the public:\n\nEWEB recently built a containment structure for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.

The scrubber is sized to handle a one-ton release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide. The\nbuilding is built to earthquake codes. The system has been checked and all of the computerized\ncomponents are Y2K compliant.\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide are fed through a vacuum system. In the event of a line break in\nthe plant, the line loses its vacuum and the feeders shut down, preventing a release.\n\nIn addition, EWEB has purchased its own one-ton cylinders so that we can be assured of, and\nmonitor the integrity of the containers. One-ton cylinders are one of the safest methods for\ntransporting and storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO (to establish a public dialog area)\n\nThe Water Plant's worst case scenario assumes that a 1-ton cylinder (the largest single container)\nstored inside the containment building released its entire contents in 10 minutes. After leaving\nthe building and with 1.5 meter per second wind, the chlorine gas would travel an estimated 0.9\nmiles before its concentration was diluted to a safe concentration (0.0087 milligrams per liter).\nUsing 0.9 miles as a radius, the estimated population that could be affected by a release is 1,650.\nPrimarily the surrounding community is a mixture of agricultural, residential, heavy commercial\nand light industrial uses.
