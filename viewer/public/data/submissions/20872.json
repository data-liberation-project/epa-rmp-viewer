In addition,\nEWEB's Water Plant is annually inspected by the local emergency responders (City of\nSpringfield Fire & Safety) and used as a drill practice site.\n\nREGULATED PROCESSES\n\nThe Water Plant uses two toxic gases (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) in the processing of safe\ndrinking water. To disinfect the raw water from the McKenzie River, chlorine gas is mixed with\nwater at a concentration of up to 3.0 parts per million (ppm). After filtration, sulfur dioxide is\nused to dechlorinate the water to approximately 0.6 ppm chlorine. The levels of chlorine in the\nwater drop in the distribution system, and normally the chlorine level in residences is between\n0.2 and 0.25 ppm residual chlorine. The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires that drinking\nwater contain a minimum of 0.20 ppm residual chlorine in the distribution system.\n\nThe Hayden Bridge containment facility can hold up to twelve one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas\n(24,000 pounds) and up to four one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide (8,000 pounds).\n\nFACILITY DESIGN\n\nThe Water Plant has taken several measures to protect the public in the event of a toxic gas\nrelease.
