Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Bridge Western, LLC (Bridge Western) facility located at 2635 South Western Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. This RMP has been updated to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    Bridge Western policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?

Bridge Western Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Bridge Western; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Bridge Western is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Bridge Western's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules, and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP update has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Bridge Western has developed an Emergency Action Plan "

Facility Identification\n\nThe Bridge Western facility is located at 2635 South Western Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.  The facility is refrigerated warehouse that is utilized for refrigerating and freezing a variety of food products. The NAICS code for the facility is 49312. \n\n\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating and freezing a variety of food products. The total amount of ammonia onsite is approximately 20,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system provides the mechanical refrigeration required for maintaining temperatures in the freezer, blast freezers, holding coolers, product re-pack area, and the inspection areas.\n\n\n\nAn area map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B contains the RMP*Submit Printout and includes additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix B contains the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B contains the RMP*Submit Printout and includes additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D contains the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above "

In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Bridge Western maintains a site specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Bridge Western has developed a site specific process hazard analysis (PHA) program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, and at a minimum, every five (5) years, and whenever required by the written Management of Change program.  In addition, this program ensures PHA's are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHA's are properly documented.  Bridge Western completed the most recent PHA revalidation study on  August 27, 2013.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - Bridge Western has developed a site specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Bridge Western completed the most recent review of the standard operating procedures on October 29, 2013. \n\n?

Mechanical Integrity - Bridge Western has developed a site specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  \n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - Bridge Western has developed a site specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Bridge Western and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n \n\n?    Incident Investigation - Bridge Western has developed a site specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed.\n\n?
