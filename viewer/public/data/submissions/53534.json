Referenced documents, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Process Safety Management Plan, Spill Prevention, Containment and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) plans are maintained at the facility and are available for inspection by authorized individuals.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the PCS Phosphate policy to provide a safe environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors.  Operations of the facility are designed so as not to adversely affect the environment of the surrounding area during emergency situations or normal operating periods.\n\nIt is the emergency response policy of the PCS Phosphate Aurora facility to immediately notify Beaufort County Dispatch of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in excess of 100 pounds, so that the public can be notified in a timely manner.  PCS Phosphate employees will mitigate or contain the release, and proivde emergency medical treatment for any injured personnel.\n\nIt is the policy of PCS Phosphate to prevent accidental release through the use of preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel.  A work order system is in plance for employees to formally report deficiencies and track them until rectified.\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nThe PCS Phosphate facility in Aurora, NC covers 35,000 acres and sits along the Pamlico River.  The Pamlico River empties into the Pamlico Sound, ten miles downstream of the facility.  The only concentrations of population within 6 miles of the facility are the Town of Aurora which lies south of the facility and has a population of approximately 1,000, and the communities of Pamlico Beach and Bayview (north of t"

The principal raw materials used at the Aurora site are phosphate rock, sulfur and ammonia.  Phosphate ore is mined in adjacent open pit mines and transported in a water slurry in enclosed pipes to the minerral processing area.  Elemental sulfur is transported in railcars and barges to the plant where it is used to produce sulfuric acid, which in turn is used to produce phosphoric acid.  The phosphoric acid is used as the feedstock to produce solid or liquid fertilizers and animal feed supplements.  Ammonia, in anhydrous form, is transported to the plant in railcars where it is used to make solid and liquid fertilizers by reacting with phosphoric acid.  The fertilizer and phosphoric acid products are stored in warehouses and tanks until they are shipped to customers by barge, railcar or truck. Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the Aurora facility by railcar and stored in 10 bullets with a maximum capacity of 244 tons.  Each bullet is administratively limited to storing 195 tons of anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars to the storage bullets in a specially designed and built facility that incorporates essential safety features.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nBoth scenarios were developed using the DEGADIS model.  The DEGADIS model is listed in 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix W as an acceptable EPA Guideline Model.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in pressurized storage bullets.  The worst-case scenario for the facility was as"

This worst case scenario has off site impacts.\n\nAlternative Case Scenarios\n\nThe alternate case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is postulated to be a 6 ton release due to a ruptured pipeline from a railcar to a storage bullet.  The amount released is based on the volume contained within the pipeline between the railcar and the storage bullet.  This assumes active mitigation with an excess flow valve on the railcar and a check valve on the storage bullet.  This alternative release scenario has off site impacts.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe PCS Phosphate Aurora facility is in full compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.  Additionally, the use of Safety and Operating Procedures provide a system to avert accidental releases by focusing on specific components of each shipment.  The safety and operating procedures manual consists of safety and operating procedures, uniquely designed for specific job tasks associated with unloading, storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.  The manual is reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes. Every inbound anhydrous ammonia shipment receives a detailed pre-unloading inspection, inspection during unloading, and a post unloading inspection by the loading technician.  A final quality assurance inspection is performed by a tank car inspector.  Employees and contractors are trained regularly to insure proficiency in all phrases of the operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n2005 None\n2006 None\n2007 None\n2008 None\n2009 One\n\nOne accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia greater than 100 pounds have occurred in the last 5 years from an RMP or OSHA PSM covered process at the PCS Phosphate Aurora facility.

The facility, its employees, and business operations are susceptible to emergencies, such as natural disasters, severe weather and man made hazards.  The CEMP, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals Program (PSM) aid in managing potential emergency situations.  PSM is more closely aligned to prevention through the use of Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Employee and Contractor Involvement, and Management of Change procedures.\n\nThe facility maintains an aggressive training program for all members of its four emergency response teams (medical, hazardous materials, technical rescue and fire), its emergency management group, employees and contractors.  In addition to the initial training programs for all emergency response team members, annual refresher training is provided along with quarterly drills and exercises.  Emergency response equipment is maintained in prime condition and includes a fully equipped ambulance, hazardous materials response vehicle, tow fire trucks and sophisticated rescue apparatus.  The emergency response teams operate under the Incident Command System and the primary Incident Commander is the Manager, Health & Safety.  All positions in each response team have at least two alternates and all members of the Emergency Management Group have designated and trained alternates.\n\nThe PCS Phosphate Aurora facility coordinates training programs with the local fire and rescue teams.  This training includes joint exercises on an annual basis.  The public is notified by using the county communications system.\n\nChange"
