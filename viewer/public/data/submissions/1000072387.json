We conduct our business in a manner that protects the environment and provides for the safety and health of employees, contractors, customers and the public. The site is also a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program. As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\r\n\r\nThe Corpus Christ Operations (CCO) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the site. \r\n\r\nThe Corpus Christi Complex maintains a full time, dedicated emergency response team. If a release occurs, Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) and Equistar personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The site also utilizes an electronic card reader access system, LENEL, which improves the accountability process for site personnel during an event. Equistar continues to take community concerns seriously, the site deploys instruments for continuous real-time ambient air monitoring around the facility when needed.  CCO utilizes and maintains a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed to the specific needs of the facility and  operations, and outlines the strategies and tactics that are to be implemented for emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility, CCO, is located at 1501 McKinzie Road, approximately 1-1/2 miles south of Annaville, 3 miles east of Robstown, and 12 miles northwest of the Corpus Christi downtown area.

Pre-start up safety reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe and environmentally compliant startup prior to placing the modification into operation.  Following mechanical completion, and prior to start-up, a Pre-Start-Up Safety Review is required whenever physical changes to process or equipment is made. .  For changes that cannot be installed without being immediately put in service (e.g. instrument range change, DCS control change) the pre-start up review and installation are done concurrently.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nCompliance audits are routinely conducted at the CCO facility to identify system improvement opportunities and incorporate applicable best practices.  Audits conducted at the site consist of internal self-assessments, corporate audits and third-party audits.  Additionally, the audits identify best practices to improve existing systems.

All site contractors, including non-resident contractors are informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding five years, there have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nEquistar's has a written emergency response plan that addresses steps and actions for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan encompasses aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Emergency response planning is coordinated with the Nueces County LEPC, the Refinery Terminal Fire Company, local law enforcement, the Corpus Christi Fire Department and area hospitals. In addition, the plan is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\nThe Corpus Christi Complex has implemented an emergency equipment inspection, testing and maintenance program which ensures that emergency response equipment will operate properly when needed.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nEquistar is working in conjunction with the Nueces County LEPC to increase public awareness and communication in the event of a chemical release.

The system includes: identifying, reporting, investigating, communicating, and tracking corrective actions. CCO's goal is to promptly report, investigate, and follow up on incidents, to help prevent recurrence and to ensure timely closure of incident investigation recommendations. Facility incident reporting is consistent both with sustaining a culture where people are not penalized or disciplined for reporting an incident while complying with relevant Human Resources policies and procedures. \r\n\r\nEquistar investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or upset release of a hazardous material.
