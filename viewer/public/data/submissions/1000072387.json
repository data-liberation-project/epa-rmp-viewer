We conduct our business in a manner that protects the environment and provides for the safety and health of employees, contractors, customers and the public. The site is also a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program. As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\n\n\n\nThe Corpus Christ Operations (\"CCO\") is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the site. \n\n\n\nThe Corpus Christi Complex maintains a full time, dedicated emergency response team. If a release occurs, Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) and Equistar personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. The site also utilizes an electronic card reader access system, LENEL, which improves the accountability process for site personnel during an event. Equistar continues to take community concerns seriously, the site deploys instruments for continuous real-time ambient air monitoring around the facility when needed.  CCO utilizes and maintains a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed to the specific needs of the facility and  operations, and outlines the strategies and tactics that are to be implemented for emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility, CCO, is located at 1501 McKinzie Road, approximately 1-1/2 miles south of Annaville, 3 miles east of Robstown, and 12 miles northwest of the Corpus Christi downtown area.

Primary access to plant is through the Main Gate located off of McKinzie Road. \n\n\n\nCCO is primarily an ethylene production facility that was originally constructed in 1980. The primarily feedstocks brought to the facility are ethane, propane and liquid hydrocarbon material.  The primary products produced by the facility include ethylene, propylene, Hydrotreated Pyrolosis Gasoline and Crude C4 (butane and butene).  The regulated substances handled at the site are methane, ethane, propane, propylene, butane, 1-butene, 1,3-butadiene, pentane, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene, 2-butene-cis, isobutane, isopentane and 2-methylpropene.  \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard. A number of processes at Equistar are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. During periodic turnarounds and projects, enhancements are implemented to better ensure plant operations remain within specific operating parameters. These safeguards also further reduce the potential for catastrophic failures during periods of excursions outside parameters.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance procedures and practices. Furthermore, these personnel have specialized training as needed. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.

Pre-start up safety reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe and environmentally compliant startup prior to placing the modification into operation.  Following mechanical completion, and prior to start-up, a Pre-Start-Up Safety Review is required whenever physical changes to process or equipment is made. .  For changes that cannot be installed without being immediately put in service (e.g. instrument range change, DCS control change) the pre-start up review and installation are done concurrently.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are routinely conducted at the CCO facility to identify system improvement opportunities and incorporate applicable best practices.  Audits conducted at the site consist of internal self-assessments, corporate audits and third-party audits.  Additionally, the audits identify best practices to improve existing systems.

The system includes: identifying, reporting, investigating, communicating, and tracking corrective actions. CCO's goal is to promptly report, investigate, and follow up on incidents, to help prevent recurrence and to ensure timely closure of incident investigation recommendations.
