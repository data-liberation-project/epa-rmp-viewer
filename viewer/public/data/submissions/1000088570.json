Our belief in environmental stewardship is revealed in our policies and demonstrated through our actions. Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Although such releases may not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response personnel at the local Fire Department to control and mitigate the effects of any release should they occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is used as a refrigerant to support our process. The quantity of ammonia in the system is approximately 61,821 pounds.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA, PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA, Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLineage maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipmen"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the checklist methodology. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be re-validated at a regular interval of five years or sooner if required by the regulation. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lineage maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nLineage has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLineage carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance procedures are performed by qualified personnel with a strong background in maintenance practices. Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Lineage Logistics"

Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Lineage Logistics. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLineage conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLineage promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLineage believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Lineage h"

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nLineage has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. We have had one accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years; the release was estimated to be 1, 146 pounds. No one offsite was injured, but evacuations occurred as a precautionary measure during the January 2020 release. One fatality and one injuries occurred on site during the release.\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nLineage has an Emergency Action Plan in place to properly prepare for emergency evacuations, to provide first aid and medical treatment and to contact federal, state and local officials in the event of a major release of ammonia, and procedures for handling small releases. If an emergency were to occur, it is Lineage's policy to notify the LEPC, the local Fire Department, and respond to the emergency. A site-specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll recommendations generated by PHAs, MOC's and other inspections will be evaluated for proper completion. Any new equipment installed in the future will incorporate new safety design and technology available at the time of installation. If, based upon mechanical integrity inspections, improvements are necessary, they will be performed in a timely fashion."
