      "SummaryText": "Covestro LLC Frankfort facility manufactures products that are sold in the paint and coatings industry. Acrylonitrile is a material used in the manufacture of those products. The chemical is stored in an above-ground tank inside a containment dike capable of retaining the contents of the entire storage tank. The chemical is transferred into the manufacturing building through steel piping. The facility is governed by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) because of the storage and use of acrylonitrile.\nAs required by the RMP standard, Covestro has identified a \"Worst Case Scenario\" to describe the potential impact to the community in the event of an acrylonitrile release. Covestro is an active member of the Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee. The scenarios considered in creation of the Risk Management Plan are based on the EPA's OCA Guidance documents and tables. The Worst Case Scenario is based on a complete loss of the acrylonitrile storage tank. It is assumed that the material will be contained in the containment dike. The dike capacity will hold the contents of the storage tank while limiting the surface area and potential evaporation. The impact of this type of release reaches an end point of 1.2 miles and includes industrial and residential receptors which triggers submission of the plan under Program 3.\nThe facility is also required to evaluate and report two alternative scenarios. The first alternative scenario is the release of acrylonitrile from piping during transfer from the storage tank to process equipment. This scenario does not include containment; and therefore, the chemical pools on the ground. The quantity and release rate are much reduced from the Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Scenario #2 and the end point of the release is a radius of 0.1 mile and includes no receptors.\nThe second alternative scenario is the release of acrylonitrile during an offload. Based on the EPA guidance document, the impact of this alternative scenari"
