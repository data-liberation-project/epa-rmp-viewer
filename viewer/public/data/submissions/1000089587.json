Poly vinyl alcohol is used in the manufacture of consumer goods packaging such as: laundry detergent bottles, ketchup bottles, and plastic lined boxes like those used for drink boxes.\n\n\n\nAs part of this production process, one RMP regulated substance in threshold quantities is utilized at Kuraray Bayport POVAL Plant. Based on applicable volumes maintained at the facility, vinyl acetate monomer is a listed toxic material. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific steps 40 CFR 68.155(c):\n\n\n\nIn general, Kuraray has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential of a release of any chemical on site. All storage tanks are located within diked areas.  Truck-unloading facilities as applicable have been replaced by direct pipeline feeds, including the VAM chemical.  Those chemicals which cannot be received by pipeline have process interlocks with automated shut-off valves should tank levels become too high.  All process areas are curbed with a sump system to capture any potential releases.  Operational rounds and LDAR programs catch small leaks when they occur, and these are documented in our incident tool for corrective action.   Chemical clean up kits are located on-site as required by SPCC program.  Operators are trained in HAZWOPER, and each shift has at least one operator with HAZMAT technician training.  \n\n\n\nFurthermore, all of the process areas at this facility regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes containing materials that are subject to the EPA RMP Rule have been incorporated into the existing OSHA PSM program, resulting in a program that is in compliance with both the OSHA and EPA regulations.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, medical treatment for exposure, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.
