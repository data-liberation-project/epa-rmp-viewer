      "SummaryText": "1.0 - INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared for Associated Grocers of New England (AGNE) (facility) located at 11 Cooperative Way in Pembroke, New Hampshire.  The AGNE facility is a grocery warehouse facility that employs approximately 259 full-time employees.  The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system subject to the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions detailed in 40 CFR Part 68. The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  \n\nThe RMP was first submitted on January 4, 2006.  This submittal is the required five-year RMP update for the ammonia refrigeration system at the AGNE facility.  This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1, since it is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n2.0 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThis facility follows a rigorous Risk Management Program and PSM Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The program is also in compliance with OSHA PSM requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the Risk Management Program and PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan has been provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Additionally, the facility has been in close, constant communication with the Pembroke Fire Department. \n\n3.0 - STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe RMP process is the standard refrigeration cycle. It uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. The only substance inside the refrigeration system is ammonia. \n\nThe process causes the ammonia to boil into a"

The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source. It then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure/temperature and cools the gas until it condenses. The condensed liquid is pumped to a low pressure part of the system where the pressure is lowered and the cycle starts all over. The ammonia changes state from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid. It does not chemically change; it is not consumed and does not wear out. It continuously circulates throughout the system.\n\n4.0 - WORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario used in this assessment identifies the Intercooler/recirculator (V-2) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design using this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included.  The worst-case release scenario is based on a release of 14,000 pounds over a period of ten minutes.  Based on Exhibit E-2 of the Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, the distance to toxic endpoint is 2.2 miles based on rural topography, which includes a residential population of 4,390.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve. This scenario was chosen as the most probable source of an ammonia release that would have the potential for off-site consequences due to the quantity of relief valves and on possibly high summer operating pressures. The  of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (60.0 lbs/min) having a release-duration of ten minutes.  A release of 600 pounds under the alternative releas"

Employees and management participate and cooperate in the both process safety programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.  Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such as  \nspecial hazards, location, safety equipment needed, P&ID's, technical operating specifications, electrical classifications, task flow diagrams, step-by-step procedures, and specific warnings.\n\nThe SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown. Various other safety programs and procedures are included.\n\nAll employees are who are involved with anhyd"

On January 24, 2008, between 50 and 75 pounds of anhydrous ammonia fluid was released from the facility during pre-scheduled maintenance repair of a valve in the refrigeration system.  The maintenance contractor diluted the anhydrous ammonia with approximately 2,250 gallons of water prior do discharging the solution to a floor drain that is connected to the municipal wastewater treatment facility (WWTF).  On-site impacts did not occur as a result of the release.  However, the WWTF noted high ammonia odors and evacuated the facility.  As a result of the January 24, 2008 ammonia release, AGNE has implemented changes at their facility to prevent future releases including a manual shutoff switch at the sewer pump and contractor pre-maintenance meetings.  \n\n7.0 - EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAmmonia leak detection is installed that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof, which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.  Facility personnel will assess the release, consult the comprehensive emergency response plan, if necessary, and determine whether response assistance is necessary.\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan has been submitted to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n8.0 - PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe company's policy is to take federal regulati"
