      "SummaryText": "This Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Dakota Ethanol facility located near Wentworth, South Dakota.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part 68 and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Dakota Ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, and natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities.  This RMP submittal is for the five-year RMP update.\n\n \n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDakota Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  It is the policy of Dakota Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant, Dakota Ethanol will notify the City of Wentworth Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nDakota Ethanol operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Wentworth, in Lake County, South Dakota.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The US. Department of Treasury requires the use of a denaturant (i.e., natural gasoline) in the final ethanol fuel product.  Natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control and as a nitrogen source to the fermentation process.\n\n3.

The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol, natural gasoline denaturant, and ammonia.  \n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Dakota Ethanol has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  \n\n4. Accident History\nDakota Ethanol has not had any accidents under RMP in the past five years of operation that are reportable under the RMP rule.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nDakota Ethanol maintains a written emergency action plan and spill response procedures. The purpose of the emergency action plan and spill response procedures is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The emergency action plan addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.   In addition, Dakota Ethanol has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\n6. Planned Changes "
