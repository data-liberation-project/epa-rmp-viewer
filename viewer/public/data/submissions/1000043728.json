The water treatment plant has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements. A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at the water treatment plant is described below.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of water treatment chemicals. The City has also established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and action plan that includes evacuation. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. To increase employee safety and awareness, the City: \n\n. Maintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures, \n\n. Performs regular preventative maintenance. \n\n. Provides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and \n\n. Conducts safety drills. \n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe water treatment plant stores potable water for delivery to the distribution system; chlorine is used as a disinfectant and must be maintained at the appropriate residual levels in the water.  Therefore, the regulated substance handled at the water treatment plant is chlorine which is stored in 1-ton containers.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps  \n\n\n\nThe chlorination process is housed in an enclosed building equipped with a scrubber that can handle up to 1-ton of chlorine if an accidental release occurs.  Chlorine gas flows from the container under vacuum.  Under normal operation, therefore, the chlorine gas is delivered under vacuum through pipe to the chlorine injection points.  If the vacuum is lost, the diaphragm i"

      "SummaryText": "n the vacuum regulator closes, stopping the flow of chlorine gas at the vacuum regulator.  This helps to prevent uncontrolled chlorine releases.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the written prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA RMP rule, and includes but is not limited to:\n\n. Formal and on-the-job training, \n\n. Written operating procedures, and \n\n. A process equipment preventive maintenance program \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental release of chlorine at this facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency action plan, per 1910.38, which is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect on-site employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes. Emergency evacuation drills are conducted periodically.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards. \n\nCombee plans to address action items resulting from the recent PSM/RMP audit and PHA in order to improve process safety.  \n\n"
