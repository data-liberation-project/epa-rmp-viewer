Documentation that equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operating in a safe manner is required for existing equipment in use for which codes, standards, or practices are no longer in general use is also required. Maintenance PM sheets should be used for this documentation.\nStaff requirements: The hazard assessment team should include personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  At least one team member should have experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated and be knowledgeable in the specific hazard assessment methodology utilized.  Environmental, health and safety personnel should be utilized as a resource where their specific expertise is warranted. Hazard assessment team leaders should have completed formal training for the hazard assessment technique to be utilized.\nFrequency of hazard assessments: The frequency of hazard assessments are based on factors such as potential consequences of known residual hazards, the time since the process was last reviewed and the potential for hazards resulting from corrosion or physical wear.\nHazard assessments will be conducted for new facilities prior to completion of the final process design. For existing facilities, whenever significant process changes with potential adverse safety, health and environmental considerations are present, the proposed changes should be subjected to a process hazard review.

Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls).  Those recommendations that are planned for implementation at the K2 Pure Solutions Pittsburg Plant will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Those applicable safeguards that have already been implemented or that were part of the original design are described below.  These safeguards prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances.  All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, level) within allowable limits.  The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits, along with interlocks to prevent operation outside of allowable limits.  K2 Pure Solutions has developed procedures and conducts training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure the correct response to the alarms.

The scenario also assumes worst case meteorological conditions of F Stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed. These conditions are very rare and when they occur, they typically only occur at approximately 2:00 am - 4:00 am. This same scenario was modeled using more likely meteorological conditions (D stability and 3 m/s wind speed) and resulted in a downwind distance of 2.4 miles.\n The worst credible release takes into account the auto-refrigerating properties of chlorine when released from a pipeline. Under these conditions, only 13% of the chlorine released from the largest vessel is expected to vaporize, resulting in a release of 52,000 pounds of chlorine\nThe alternate release scenario also required by the CalARP regulation uses more common meteorological conditions of D Stability and 3 m/s wind speed and shows that the release may reach 0"

In addition to the EPA criteria of one alternative release scenario using the more typical meteorological conditions, Contra Costa County requires that meteorological conditions similar to those used in the worst case release scenario be used for the alternate release scenario in addition to the more typical conditions. This includes an atmospheric stability class of F, in an urban area, and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  \nAs part of this analysis, the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) Level 2 was used to determine the potential downwind consequences of an accidental release. ERPG-2 is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. This value is used to aid local Fire and Police Departments with overall emergency management in the event of a release at this facility.\nThe ERPG-2 for chlorine is 3 ppm. TABLE 1 summarizes the maximum downwind distances to the ERPG-2 and the estimated residential populations that are at risk of being exposed to the ERPG-2 concentration for each release. The residential population at-risk numbers are the estimated number of people living within the radius of the maximum downwind distance reached by the plume in all wind directions.\n\nTABLE 1:  Summary of Maximum Downwind Distances and At-Risk Populations\nRelease Scenario\tToxic Endpoint\tMaximum Downwind Distance\tResidential Population at Risk\nWorst Case Release (F / 1.5)\t3 ppm\t20 miles\t835,827\n(840,000 for EPA Reporting)\nWorst Case Release (D / 3)\t3 ppm\t2.4 miles\t44,652\nWorst Credible (F / 1.5)\t3 ppm\t7 miles\t179,680\nWorst Credible (D / 3)\t3 ppm\t0.9 miles\t90\nA"

The purpose of this standard is to define the procedure and authority levels for making plant changes in the implementation of continuous improvement in a manner that allows for team input. This will assure plant safety, environmental responsibility, product quality, and efficient plant operation.\nK2 Pure's MOC process applies to any changes made to the Pittsburg plant production processes.  This includes any change to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or process safety information (PSI) used in the plant production processes. It includes such things as changes in materials of construction, physical s or capacities, raw materials, operating procedures, process parameters, control schemes, equipment additions, deletions, or rearrangements, and changes to the organization chart and staffing levels. Plant changes do not include routine maintenance of equipment.  Plant changes also typically do not include replacements in kind. However, any replacement or change that does not comply with current engineering standards shall be considered a plant change.\nManagement Of Change Procedure\nOriginator Initiates Change\nAny employee may initiate a Management of Change (MOC) by completing a Design Change Request (DCR) form. The Description field should be used to communicate the technical basis for the change. The requestor will also use the cover sheet to communicate whether the change is permanent or temporary, the duration of a temporary change, and the expected impact on the environment, health, and safety. The requestor will also attach marked up copies of any process safety information (PSI) affected by the change. Process safety information (PSI) markups should use red pencil (or type) to indicate additions; green pencil (or type) to indicate deletions, yellow is to remain or checked okay, and blue or lead pencil for notes to the draftsman or word processor.
