The gas exits the electrolyzers and isthen cooled in two steps to remove most of the water. A portion of the cooled gas may be diverted to make sodium hypochlorite \"bleach\". The remainder enters a series of towers in which the rest of the water is removed by direct contact with sulfuric acid.\nOnce the water is removed, the gas is approximately 97% chlorine by volume with the other 3% being comprised of mostly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This dry gas is then cooled by contacting it with liquid chlorine in the Suction Chiller. A portion of the liquid feed is not vaporized and is removed from the bottom of the Suction Chiller to the Low Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintain"

A portion of the compressed gas (up to 100 tons/day) is diverted to make sodium hypochlorite \"bleach\" by direct contact with a solution of sodium hydroxide. All of the remaining compressed gas (up to 200 tons/day) is converted to liquid chlorine when the gas is cooled in two stages of refrigeration. The liquid chlorine from the liquefaction step is collected in the Chlorine Proof Tanks. Each of these storage tanks, which are maintained at 2 PSIG, has a maximum capacity of 100 tons of chlorine. These tanks are operated so that one is being filled while the other is being emptied.\nLiquid chlorine collected in the Chlorine Proof Tanks is analyzed to verify that it meets the quality specification requirements, and is then transferred to the High Grade Chlorine Storage Tanks.

California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation (California Code of Regulations Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2750)\nA?    EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR Part 68.\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of the study is chlorine.\nSix scenarios are included in the report:\nA?

The 20-mile radius shown is considered to be the worst case distance in any single, wind direction. The scenario also assumes \"worst case\" meteorological conditions of \"F\" Stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed. These conditions are very rare and when they occur, they typically only occur at approximately 2:00 am - 4:00 am. This same scenario was modeled using more likely meteorological conditions (\"D\" stability and 3 m/s wind speed) and resulted in a downwind distance of 2.4 miles.\n The worst credible release takes into account the auto-refrigerating properties of chlorine when released from a pipeline. Under these conditions, only 13% of the chlorine released from the largest vessel is expected to vaporize, resulting in a release of 52,000 pounds of chlorine\nThe alternate release scenario also required by the CalARP regulation uses more common meteorological conditions of \"D\" Stability and 3 m/s wind speed and shows that the release may reach 0"

In addition to the EPA criteria of one alternative release scenario using the more typical meteorological conditions, Contra Costa County requires that meteorological conditions similar to those used in the worst case release scenario be used for the alternate release scenario in addition to the more \"typical\" conditions. This includes an atmospheric stability class of \"F,\" in an urban area, and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  \nAs part of this analysis, the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) Level 2 was used to determine the potential downwind consequences of an accidental release. ERPG-2 is defined as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" This value is used to aid local Fire and Police Departments with overall emergency management in the event of a release at this facility.\nThe ERPG-2 for chlorine is 3 ppm. TABLE 1 summarizes the maximum downwind distances to the ERPG-2 and the estimated residential populations that are at risk of being exposed to the ERPG-2 concentration for each release. The residential population at-risk numbers are the estimated number of people living within the radius of the maximum downwind distance reached by the plume in all wind directions.\n\nTABLE 1:  Summary of Maximum Downwind Distances and At-Risk Populations\nRelease Scenario    Toxic Endpoint    Maximum Downwind Distance    Residential Population at Risk\nWorst Case Release (F / 1.5)    3 ppm    20 miles    835,827\n(840,000 for EPA Reporting)\nWorst Case Release (D / 3)    3 ppm    2.4 miles    44,652\nWorst Credible (F / 1.5)    3 ppm    7 miles    179,680\nWorst Credible (D / 3)    3 ppm    0.9 miles    90\nA"

The purpose of this standard is to define the procedure and authority levels for making plant changes in the implementation of continuous improvement in a manner that allows for team input. This will assure plant safety, environmental responsibility, product quality, and efficient plant operation.\nK2 Pure's MOC process applies to any changes made to the Pittsburg plant production processes.  This includes any change to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or process safety information (PSI) used in the plant production processes. It includes such things as changes in materials of construction, physical s or capacities, raw materials, operating procedures, process parameters, control schemes, equipment additions, deletions, or rearrangements, and changes to the organization chart and staffing levels. Plant changes do not include routine maintenance of equipment.  Plant changes also typically do not include replacements in kind. However, any replacement or change that does not comply with current engineering standards shall be considered a plant change.\nManagement Of Change Procedure\nOriginator Initiates Change\nAny employee may initiate a Management of Change (MOC) by completing a Design Change Request (DCR) form. The \"Description\" field should be used to communicate the technical basis for the change. The requestor will also use the cover sheet to communicate whether the change is permanent or temporary, the duration of a temporary change, and the expected impact on the environment, health, and safety.
