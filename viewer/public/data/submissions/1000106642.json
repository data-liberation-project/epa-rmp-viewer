Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.Planned  Changes to  Improve Safety\n\nContinental Dairy Facilities Southwest, LLC expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a  PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the process hazard analysis are designed  to improve the safety performance of the ammonia  refrigeration  process.   Continental Dairy Facilities Southwest, LLC  expects to evaluate each recommendation  in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."

All employees are informed  of hazards  in the workplace. Employees who work with  potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those  substances. This facility has procedures  in  place to safely remove  employees from  areas in the unlikely event that a  hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in  place emergency notification  and  response procedures.\n\nFacility and  Regulated Substances\n\nContinental Dairy Facilities Southwest, LLC ,  based in Littlefield, TX processes milk into various dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, condensed milk,  and cream. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia,  is used in a  closed-loop  refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.   In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment,  CDFSW has partnered with APSM to develop and sustain an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia  releases and  mitigate the consequences of a  release, should one occur.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data  is available for review onsite at the  Continental Dairy Facilities Southwest, LLC.\n\nGeneral Accidental  Release Prevention  Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Littlefield Texas facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response  necessary for a  release of ammonia from the refrigeration  system.  Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms  are provided with ammonia  detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The refrigeration system  is designed  so that major components can be isolated  by closing selected valves.  Further, refrigeration system operators have  been trained and  are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refr"
