This facility complies with the Chlorine Institute and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) requirements for chlorine gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify 911, the City of Apopka Fire Dispatcher, and request response to the emergency.  The City of Apopka's Fire Department is equipped with a HazMat team that is trained and qualified in responding to these emergencies. A description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.  This facility is a municipal drinking water treatment operation.  Chlorine is used to treat drinking water with a chlorination system as water is pumped into the ground storage tanks, prior to being pumped into the water distribution system.  Chlorine is stored and used from 1-ton (2,000 pounds) cylinders in a separate storage area from the chlorination feed control room.  The chlorination system consists of two (2) 1-ton chlorine cylinders on-line at all times.  From the on-line chlorine cylinders, gaseous chlorine is injected under vacuum for drinking water treatment.  A maximum of two (2) 1-ton cylinders (4,000 pounds) are on hand at the water plant.  This facility consists of a combination administration, high service pump and chlorination control building; a chlorine storage area, a ground storage tank and a parking lot.  A chain link and rod iron fence encloses the facility's operation.  The worst case scenario is a release of chlorine from the total failure of a 1-ton cylinder.  This event is unlikely to occur and is presented here as required by the Risk Management Program regulations.  The worst case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a 1-ton cylinder is completely released over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a gaseous release of chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "he distance to endpoint for this quantity of chlorine is 1.3 miles. The alternative release scenario is a more realistic accident that would involve a release of gaseous chlorine from a sheared or broken valve.  It has been assumed that 1,110 pounds of gaseous chlorine would be released.  According to the TRACE model, the distance to endpoint for this quantity of gaseous chlorine is 0.1 miles.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorination system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) state regulations.  The operators at the water plants are Florida State Certified Professionals.  To prepare for an emergency, plant operators have been trained in respiratory protection, emergency action and fire prevention.  The operators have many years of experience safely handling chlorine.  They receive updated training regarding operations and safety on a regular basis.  The Sheeler Oaks Water Plant has not had an accident involving chlorine in the last five years that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the chlorination system or the stored chlorine, it is our policy to notify 911 (the City of Apopka Fire Dispatcher) and request response to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the City of Apopka Fire Department and members of the fire department have inspected and trained on our chlorination system."
