      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is prepared for BEI Hawaii \u00bf Puhi Facility of Kauai Branch.  This Facility stores fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural and industrial chemicals.  BEI Hawaii developed this site specific Risk Management Plans for BEI Hawaii\u00bfs facility that are regulated under risk management program to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and to protect public safety and environment.  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the publics, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of the accidental release.\n\nThis RMP consists of five chapters.  Chapter 1, Management, introduces the plans and describes the facility operations, management and responsibilities.  Chapter 2, Off-Site Consequence Analysis \u00bf Hazardous Assessment, provides hazard release consequences and impact in worst case and alternative scenario, Chapter 3, Five-Year Accident History Of Chlorine.  Chapter 4, Summary of Prevention Program, provides some safety information, hazard analysis, operation procedures, and prevention procedures.  Chapter 5, Summary of Emergency Response program\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBEI Hawaii believes in a clean and safe environment and is dedicated to meet all applicable environmental standards in the operation of its businesses and services.  BEI Hawaii has established comprehensive policies and procedures for the operations of its facilities.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance that assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.  The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment, and to protect the environment from pollutions.\n\nPreservation of the environmen"

      "SummaryText": "t is a commitment that must be shared by all employees.  Employees shall promptly report suspected violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits to their supervisor who shall take immediate action to verify the report and, If confirmed, stop the violation and take remedial or other appropriate action.  The incident shall be promptly reported to BEI Hawaii\u00bfs Regulatory Compliance Manager, who will assist in making any necessary reports to regulatory agencies.\n\nOverall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone\u00bfs responsibility and working safely is a condition of employment. Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures. Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions, training and a safety award program.   \n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nThe BEI Hawaii  \u00bf Puhi facility is located at 1875 Haleukana Street, Lihue, Kauai Island.   This facility stores fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural and industrial chemicals.  The products are warehoused at the facility and distributed to various locations throughout the Kauai Island.  The regulated substance handled at this storage/distribution facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is received in 150-lb and 1-ton Department of Transportation (DOT) approved cylinders.  BEI Hawaii receives chlorine from a chemical supplier and distributor located on the west coast.  The chlorine supplier is responsible for container inspection and maintenance.  On average, the BEI Hawaii \u00bf Puhi facility stores approximately 7,000 lbs and Maximum 13,600 lbs chlorine.  \n\n3.  Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-case release scenario \u00bf failure of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder releases 2,000 pounds of chlorine within a 10-minute time frame.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are rele"

The EPA model RMPComp (version 1.07) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming worst-case meteorology of 1.5 m/s stability class F, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure.\n\nAlternative-case release scenario \u00bf one ton chlorine cylinder falls over and shears off the valve, leaves a 1\u00bf circular hole on the cylinder releasing 150 lbs per minutes of chlorine in a 14-minute time frame.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released as a dense vapor cloud.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint (for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L [~3 ppm]) was predicted to be 0.2 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMP*Comp was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming average meteorology of 3.0 m/s stability class D, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure.\n\nThe BEI Hawaii facility maintains two chlorine container emergency kits (one \u00bfA\u00bf kit for 100 & 150 lb cylinders and one \u00bfB\u00bf kit for 2,000 lb cylinders), and has a chlorine recovery vessel (chlorine coffin).  The Kauai Fire Department also maintains \u00bfA\u00bf and \u00bfB\u00bf kits and a chlorine recovery vessel.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\nThe facility complies with applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  The facility maintains a Process Safety Management Plan that was developed and is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  The BEI Hawaii Process Safety Management Plan addresses:\n\n\u00b7 process safety information (includes information on first aid and medical management procedures for chlorine)\n\u00b7 process hazard analysis\n\u00b7 operating procedures (including safe handling procedures for storage and loading)\n\u00b7 training (including leak mitigation)\n\u00b7 contractors\n\u00b7 pre-startup review\n\u00b7 mechanical inte"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility is a new facility.  It has had no reportable accidents during the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program \n\nThe BEI Hawaii  \u00bf Kauai facility is classified as a non-responding facility.  As such, BEI Hawaii has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee/community safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response with an in-house response team.  The BEI Hawaii  - Kauai Facility has developed its own procedures as outlined in the BEI Hawaii Safety and Health Program incorporating information from Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  BEI Hawaii has coordinated response to incidents with the Kauai Fire Department Hazmat Team.  Operators are capable, however, of responding to incidental releases such as routine tightening of a valve, for example. \n\nBEI Hawaii \u00bf Kauai branch personnel are trained to first responder operation level.  They are trained to respond in an operation level defensive mitigation measures (i.e., secure areas, initiate water spray, etc.,) to limit the release until a response team arrives to establish the incident command.  We have discussed this program with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Kauai Fire Department.  In addition, BEI Hawaii has arranged with local response contractors to deal with potential releases at the facility.  \n\n7.  Planned change to improve safety\n\nSince this is a new facility, all designs are based the storage regulatory requirement. Currently, there are no plans to change the storage practices at this facility. Chlorine use for swimming pools and sewage treatment is anticipated to diminish over the next few years as new disinfections methods are employed.  BEI Hawaii has already experienced reduced levels of chlorine a"
