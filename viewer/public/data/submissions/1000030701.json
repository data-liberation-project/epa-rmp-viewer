The plant has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  This is a 5 year update to the initial RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\n\n\nDiamond has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nDiamond's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release if incidental.  In the event of an emergency, Diamond's employees are not responsible to respond.  The facility will utilize the local fire department as first responders.  In the event of a non-incidental oil release, Diamond has contracted with an off-site spill response contractor to assist first responders with containment and clean-up.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe facility is a stationary source and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Locally grown grains are used for use as a fuel additive.  Denaturant is added to the fuel alcohol to make it unfit for human consumption.  Anhydrous ammonia is used onsite to assist with pH control.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\n\n\nDiamond has developed a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan with the purpose of identifying the mo"

This plan is prepared by a professional engineer and requires the facility to complete routine inspections and maintenance on oil containing equipment.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the covered areas since the establishment of Diamond.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nDiamond has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including an Emergency Action Plan, Health and Safety Plan, Facility Response Plan, and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Diamond's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nDiamond routinely reviews incidents and accidents to improve safety including equipment testing and safety assessments.  The facility has and will continue to coordinate response activities with emergency responders including drills and deployment exercises.  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.\n\n"
