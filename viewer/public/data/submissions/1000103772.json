Superior Refining Company has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials (e.g., the fire department, regional hazmat team) and emergency response organizations through the 911 system. In the event of a release that so warrants, 911 would be called with information on potential community impact(s).\n\nThe local community government and response personnel would then initiate the proper response warranted by the situation. This system provides a means of facilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if necessary. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Superior Refining Company conducts periodic emergency response exercises that involve Refinery personnel, contractors, and emergency response organizations. The Refinery provides annual refresher training to on-site emergency responders regarding their responsibilities during an emergency and also has a trained emergency response team.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSuperior Refining Company has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction, recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and process safety requirements.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Superior Refining Company periodically conducts compliance audits to confirm that the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

These procedures (and others), along with training of personnel, form a system to help assure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. Procedures are available to all personnel in a Safety and Health Procedure database maintained at the Refinery.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nSuperior Refining Company has a comprehensive system to manage change. This system requires that changes to items or activities such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

Superior Refining Company has a comprehensive training program for all maintenance workers. Inspections and tests help assure that equipment functions as intended and verify that equipment is fit for service (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). Deficiencies are corrected as appropriate.  The temporary use of equipment in which a deficiency is noted but it is infeasible to correct at the time (because, for example, the Refinery is operating) would be allowed only after the system is reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to assure the safe operation of the equipment until a repair can be made (e.g., reduction of pressures or temperatures). The temporary use of equipment is covered under the Refinery MOC policy, which addresses these types of issues.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Superior Refining Company incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps assure that equipment and parts are suitable for their intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices instruction prior to beginning work. The Superior Refining Company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Refinery personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nSuperior Refining Company conducts a PSSR for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our highly trained personnel, working in cooperation with public agencies and private companies will quickly respond to, control, contain and mitigate the release. In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the Refinery, working in conjunction with local, state and/or federal emergency management staff, is well-prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community and the environment. The Refinery maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan. This plan is also maintained in the Douglas County Emergency Government Center. Emergency notification of the public is coordinated through local governmental agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nSuperior Refining Company, located in Superior, Wisconsin, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil feedstock, including fuel gas, propane, butane, fuel oils, gasoline, and asphalt. The Refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Refinery.
