They are also used for home heating and in power plants to produce electricity Common products produced with flammables\ninclude:\n    Coffeemakers\n    Automotive dashboards\n    Synthetic fibers and fabrics\n    Boat sails\n    Plastic milk and beverage cartons\n    Children's toys\n    Computer cases\n    Parachutes\n    Carpets and carpet backing\n    Synthetic tuber\n\nShintech has the following naturally occurring compounds on-site: vinyl chloride. This compound is used as a feed stock by us and other companies to manufacture a variety of products.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF FLAMMABLE MATERIALS\n\nFlammable compounds all have the potential to cause explosions when released in a confined cloud and can be a source of fuel for rims. The primary concerns with these types of accidents are flying debris \n(objects), burns, and popping eardrums or being knocked down by, the force of the blast. In most cases, these concerns primarily affect employees and others who are on-site. Employees and contractors who work around flammable compounds take the following extra precautions:\n\n   Undergoing special OSHA training on how to fight fires.\n\n   Participating in engineering reviews of their work areas to prevent leaks which could contribute to fires.\n\n\nWHAT DOES SHINTECH DO TO KEEP US SAFE?\n\nShintech Inc. uses a variety, of safety equipment and procedures to prevent accidental releases. Following are some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at our facilities:\n\n     Automatic shut-off devices and relief valves  handle unexpected rises in temperature or \n     pressure.\n\n     Safety controls, including warning alarms,  interlocks and leak detectors, provide multiple \n     lines of defense.\n\n     Cont"
