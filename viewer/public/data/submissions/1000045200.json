The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to some operations at this facility.  The Facility engages in either the formulation, distribution and/or the sale of chemicals to customers, most of whom use the products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0).  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nFive year update and new processes planned to be operated at this Facility in the near future.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Facility operates agricultural chemical distribution and formulation equipment and sells agriculture chemical products to farms and other agricultural supply companies.  The Facility intends to operate the following covered processes:    \n\n\n\nCovered Process 1: Railcar Storage.  Railcars containing anhydrous ammonia are stored on the Facility rail spur for short periods of time without their mode of transport.  The railcars are owned by the anhydrous ammonia vendors or the railroad and are maintained at an off-site location. However, if or when a railcar with anhydrous ammonia is parked on the Facility rail spur, trained Facility Process Operators will be responsible for receiving and inspecting the railcars.  \n\n\n\nCovered Process 2: Sto"

      "SummaryText": "rage and Handling.  Anhydrous ammonia is off-loaded from commercial tanker trucks and/or railcars into a stationary storage tank(s).  The transfer operations from tanker trucks to the storage tank(s) are conducted by a commercial truck operator (Contractor/Vendor).  Facility Process Operators manage the anhydrous ammonia once it has been transferred to the storage tank,.  The anhydrous ammonia is then transferred to either other storage vessels (e.g. nurse tanks) or processes (e.g. fertilizer blending).  This Facility only conducts blending operations.\n\n\n\nCovered Process 3:  APP Reacting.  The Facility will manufacture liquid ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer using a Pipe Reactor (PR).  The ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid in the PR.  The resulting ammonium polyphosphate solution is blended with water and discharged to a \"wet well\" before it is then cooled and transferred to atmospheric storage tanks.  Trained Facility and/or evaluated Contractor Process Operators will operate the process.\n\n\n\nCovered Process 4:  AS/ABS Manufacturing.  The Facility will manufacture liquid ammonium sulfite and ammonium bisulfite (AS/ABS) fertilizer ingredients using absorption towers.  The AS/ABS is manufactured by reacting anhydrous ammonia with sulfur dioxide gas in an absorption tower.  The sulfur dioxide gas is produced by burning molten sulfur in a furnace.  The resulting AS/ABS fertilizer ingredients are blended with water before it is transferred to atmospheric storage tanks .  Trained Facility Process Operators will operate the process.\n\n\n\nCovered Process 5:  ATS Blending.  The Facility will manufacture liquid ammonium thiosulfate (ATS) fertilizer using mixing tanks.  The ATS is manufactured by mixing AS/ABS with elemental sulfur solution,  Anhydrous ammonia is used for pH adjustment.  The resulting ATS fertilizer is then transferred to atmospheric storage tanks .  Trained Facility Process Operators will"

      "SummaryText": " operate the process.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for each covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  For covered processes 1, 2, and 3, the largest vessel is a 34,000-gallon railcar.  For Processes 4 and 5, the largest vessel is a 14000-gallon storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia railcar or tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes that a vapor valve is not fully closed after a transfer process.  The alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Processes 2 and 3 assumes a rupture of a transfer hose caused by a pull-away or an impact from a vehicle or some other source during a major loading or unloading operation.  The alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Processes 4 and 5 assumes the failure of the transfer piping for some unknown event.  Although these releases are classified as alternative scenarios, even an accident of these types are unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves, emergency shutoff valves) and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMPr Implementation Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Manager is responsible for assuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis Facility is a non-responding facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and/or fire departmen"
