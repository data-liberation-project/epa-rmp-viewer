This committment is strongly supported by senior managment and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility.  This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility, in cooperation with local response agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Bridger Lake Plant is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane and a pentane-natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via pipeline and/or trucks.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT - WORST CASE SCENARIO:\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere; having an offsite impact.  EPA's OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  This type of scenario is very unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance sc"

The result of the release would have an offsite impact.  EPA's OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, which further reduces the likelihood of this occurring.\n\nThis facility is regulated by 29CRF 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CRF112 (Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employe"

Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\nThis facility has a policy of investigating incidents, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\n\nThe Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program; ensuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Bridger Lake Plant has had an excellent accident prevention program over the last five (5) years.  There have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances, which resulted in offsite effects.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training, which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs that are on the market today.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
