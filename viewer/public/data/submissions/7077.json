              "Description": "     This process consists of two storage tanks and is interconnected with five reaction vessels in a manufacturing building, and interconnecting piping.  The PHA dates are 11/28/95, 11/29/95, and 1/15/96.  The storage tanks are located within a concrete diked area, complete with a firewater sprinkler system and a flammable vapor detection system.  The tanks are pressure vessels with a design working pressure of 75 PSIG.    The storage tanks utilize relief valves with rupture dics, freon refrigeration, and a nitrogen gas (inert) blanketing system as control devices.\n     The storage tank area contains a firewater system supply controlled by a flammable vapor detection system.  The presence of flammable vapor causes the firewater sprinkler system to activate causing a water deluge to occur in the ethylene oxide storage tank area.  \n   The reactor vessels have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen gas purge system, emergency air supply, a computer distributed control system, plus an instrument interlock system which will not allow ethylene oxide to be fed into a reactor vessel unless a number of process parameters are satisfied.\n     The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire briage training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.  All production tickets are reviewed by the engineering department after a production run has been completed.",

The dates of the PHA are 10/19/93, 6/30/94, 7/7/94, and 11/4/94.  The formaldehyde is stored in an insulated heated above ground storage tank.  The storage tank is blanketed with nitrogen gas and the nitrogen gas/formaldehyde vapors are vented to the plant vapor combustor system as a control device.  The tank is equipped with high liquid level shutoff protection and relief valve protection.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors is available for use in fire conditions.  Both fire fighting foam and spill control (vapor suppression) foam is maintained at the plant.\n     The reactor vessels in both manufacturing buildings have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen purge systems, a vapor combustor for vapor destruction, emergency air supply, and a computer distributed control system for batch reaction control.\n     The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire briage training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.",

The dates of the PHA are 2/9/98 and 2/18/98.  Methyl Chloride is stored as a pressurized liquid.  The storage vessel utilizes excess flow check valves and pressure relief valves as control devices.  The storage vessel is built to pressure code specifications.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors is available for use as a mitigation device for methyl chloride vapors in the event of an air release.\n     The reactor vessels in the manufacturing building have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen purge systems, a vapor combustor for vapor destruction, emergency air supply, and a computer distributed control system for batch reaction control.\n     The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire briage training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.",

One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Baker Petrolite and also compiles with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP rule).  A requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management prepared for the Baker Petrolite Bayport facility.  The purpose of this document is to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk managment program at Baker Petrolite.\n\n     Through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances, Baker Petrolite is committed to the safety of its' employees, the public population, and the preservation of the environment.  Baker Petrolite implements reasonable controls to prevent identifiable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain these releases.  If a release event occurred, Baker Petrolite would evaluate the release, evacuate workers as required, contact the LaPorte police department (LEPC) dispatcher to inform them of the release, and prevent or reduce the consequences of the release.

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS).  Baker Petrolite does not expect a WCS to ever occur.  An ARS is a more realistic scenario that is more likely to occur than the WCS at a facility such as Baker Petrolite.  The ARSs will help the LEPC to improve the community emergency response plan.

If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (281) 291-3286.\n\n     The WCS for toxic substances is the failure of the anhydrous ammonia railroad storage vessel in the anhydrous ammonia process, resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period.
