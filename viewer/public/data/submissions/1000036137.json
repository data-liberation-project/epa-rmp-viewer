LES is a municipally-owned and operated electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska.  As a publicly owned utility, LES operates and maintains all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with the expectations of LES customer/owner's.  LES strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of LES policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk Management Program LES is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  LES is committed to the accidental release prevention program.  \r\n\r\nLES maintains a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for the Terry Bundy Generating Station.  The plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others.  \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe LES Terry Bundy Generating Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base load electric power generation. The site is equipped with three landfill gas fired internal combustion generators rated at 2,242 brake horsepower (1600ekW) and three LM 6000 dual fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines located on the 320-acre site; one of which operates in simple cycle, and two operate in either simple cycle or combined cycle with a steam turbine.  The LM 6000 turbines are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx emission control.  This system uses anhydrous ammonia which is fed into the"

The pressure vessel has a 12,000 gallon or 60,000 pound capacity with a maximum fill level at 80%.  As the result, the normal operating amount of ammonia stored in the Terry Bundy Generating Station is 9,600 gallons or 48,223 pounds.  \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(c) The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\r\n\r\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an offisite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated substance.  In Terry Bundy Generating Station's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance.  Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 2.\r\n\r\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The largest quantity is determined by taking into account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel to store greater than usual quantities.   EPA defined alternative release scenarios to be any release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\r\n\r\nFor offsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated aubstance release to the atmosphere is predicted using the computer model called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere (ALOHA).  ALOHA predicts pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of ammonia, the physical characteristics of the site, weather con"
