Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of The McGregor Company, along with the crew of the Washtucna facility located at 1047 South Highway 261, Washtucna, Washington 99371, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, The McGregor Company and the Washtucna retail facility are prepared to work with the local fire department or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n \n*  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n*  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as agricultural grade fertilizer to local farmers.\n*  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 19,500-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 90,000 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case release scenario involves the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The scenario at this facility would release 90,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .98 miles.  This figure comes from TFI?s DEGADIS model.\n\nb.    The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident that might occur at this facility.  We used the scenario that a 2? transfer hose would break and release 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.  This figure comes from TFI?s DEGADIS model"

Five-year Accident History\n*  There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n*  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n*  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.    The Emergency Action Policy\nThe facility?s emergency action policy was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n*  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38\n*  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Facility Accidental Release Policy.\nThe McGregor Company and its 42 retail fertilizer facilities located in Washington, Idaho and Oregon have an outstanding record on safety and environmental issues.  We have an excellent safety and maintenance program and have won several regional, state and national environmental respect awards.  Safety and environmental improvements are an ongoing process for The McGregor Company and all of its retail fertilizer facilities."
