If an accidental release should occur, The McGregor Company and the Washtucna retail facility are prepared to work with the local fire department or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n \n*  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n*  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as agricultural grade fertilizer to local farmers.\n*  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 19,500-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 90,000 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The scenario at this facility would release 90,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .98 miles.  This figure comes from TFI\u00bfs DEGADIS model.\n\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident that might occur at this facility.  We used the scenario that a 2\u00bf transfer hose would break and release 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.  This figure comes from TFI\u00bfs DEGADIS model"

Safety and environmental improvements are an ongoing process for The McGregor Company and all of its retail fertilizer facilities."
