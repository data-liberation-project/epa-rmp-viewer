This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  Our facility's primary activities encompass chemical manufacturing. We have two regulated substances present at the facility. These substances are Sulfur Trioxide and Acrylonitrile. Sulfur Trioxide is used in our Reservol Production, while Acrylonitrile is used in the production of Amine Adducts, TGUM-AHG, and ANOBEX. The maximum inventory of Sulfur Trioxide, considering administrative controls, is 80,000 lb. The maximum inventory of Acrylonitrile is 100,000 lb.\r\n\r\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Our facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR 68. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Tiarco Chemical maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the processes using sulfur trioxide and acrylonitrile.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Major Hazard Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety,"

Any findings related to the process hazards analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:  For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tiarco Chemical maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operations such as normal operation, emergency shutdown, and startup after turnaround. The information is reviewed annually and is readily accessible to operators and other personnel working with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining:  Tiarco Chemical has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  Tiarco Chemical carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation of equipment such as piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, and pumps. In addition, Tiarco Chemical conducts regular inspections and periodic testing of equipment, including reactors and storage tanks. Maintenance personnel are trained in the chemical hazards, process operations, and maintenance tasks. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:  Written procedures are in place at Tiarco Chemical to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a change are promptly made aware of and offered training related to the change.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews:  Pre-Startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Tiarco Chemical. These reviews are conducted"

Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility's PSM and RMP program, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors:  A procedure is in place to cover the use of outside contractors. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance would be carried out. Tiarco Chemical has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency action should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. The safety performance of contractors is evaluated on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:  Tiarco Chemical had a release of Sulfur Trioxide on February 9, 2008. Approximately 0.5 lb of vapor was released over a 30 minute period. The Donaldson Center Fire Department responded to the release. No employees or responders were injured as a result of the release. No one in the community was injured and there was no property damage. As a result of the accident, Tiarco Chemical repaired and improved the failed equipment and revised the maintenance procedures.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan:  Tiarco Chemical has a written emergency plan addressing, among other things, evacuation, notification of emergency responders, state agencies, and the public, mitigation actions that can be taken, first air and medical treatment, and preventive actions to avoid exposure to sulfur trioxide or acrylonitrile. Tiarco Chemical relies on the Donaldson Center F"
