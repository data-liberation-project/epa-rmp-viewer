All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  \nThe Evonik Corporation Hopewell plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training and safety in the design installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Evonik has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nEvonik Corporation Hopewell plant is a specialty chemicals production facility located at 914 E. Randolph Road in Hopewell, Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 40 acres on the east side of Hopewell in the industrial section of the city.  \n\nOrganic surfactants and esters have been manufactured at the Evonik Hopewell site since 1982, with an organo-modified silicones production facility added in 1991.  The Hopewell Polyether Plant (HPE-1) produces specialty polyethers and began operation in 2004.  The site employs approximately 95 employees at the Randolph Road site and is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nEvonik Corporation produces organic surfactants, organo-modified silicones and polyethers at the Hopewell, Virginia facility.  As defined by the regulations, the Hopewell facility stores the following Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHC's) in excess of the threshold quantities: \n1. Ethylene Oxide (CAS # 75-21-8), Maximum storage capacity =  434,310 pounds.\n2. Propylene Oxide (CAS # 75-56-9), Maximum storage capacity = 418,878 pounds.\n3. Allyl Alcohol (CAS # 107-18-6), Maximum storage capacity = 110,231 pounds. \n\nThe HHC's are utilized in th"
