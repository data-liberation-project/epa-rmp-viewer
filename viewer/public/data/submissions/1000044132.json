Arrangements are also made to familiarize the local hospital with the types of injuries or illnesses that could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the facility.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for products commonly stored on-site are available to all employees and have been distributed to those entities with which arrangements have been made.\r\n\r\nThe EC receives comprehensive training in emergency response including emergency preparedness, knowledge of the site evacuation plan and procedures, knowledge of materials stored on-site and their locations, effective utilization of safety equipment, and firefighting.  The Emergency Response Team receives training in firefighting procedures.  As part of the facility's training program, employees are instructed in the nature and hazards of the chemicals with which they may come in contact.

The facility receives waste materials, primarily organic solvent wastes, from various manufacturers.  Once on-site, the waste materials are separated into various waste and product categories depending on how the material will be processed.  Certain types of wastes are treated and processed in order to recover products that may be reused/recycled by industrial customers.  Other wastes are prepared for shipment to other Veolia or non-Veolia facilities for additional treatment or disposal. \r\n\r\nThere are (will be) two particular processes at the facility that have the capacity to store a regulated chemical (piperidine) in a quantity sufficient to require the preparation and implementation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The two processes will be performed on an event basis for one year.  This RMP plan will be terminated at the end of the one year.  Process 1 involves the storage/handling & recovery/recycling of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).  Starting in August 2014, crude NMP containing 1.25% piperidine will be delivered to Veolia and stored in fourteen (14) temporary 21,000 gallon frac tanks.  The NMP in the frac tanks is run through an existing distillation unit to recover the NMP which is then sent back to the PSM regulated stationary tanks located among the facility's existing tank farms.  The recovered NMP is then distributed as a product to customers.  Waste piperidine generated from the recovery process in the form of condensate and still bottoms will be shipped off for treatment and disposal at third party facilities.  Assuming all 14 frac tanks are in operation and all NMP contains 1.25% piperidine, it is estimated that approximately 31,000 pounds of piperidine may be present on-site in the NMP recycling process. \r\n\r\nPr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess 2 also involves the storage/handling & recycling/recovery of NMP containing piperidine.  Waste NMP will be stored in stationary tanks located among the facility's existing tank farms.  A maximum of 100,000 gallons of waste NMP is expected to be stored at the facility containing 3.75% piperidine, though a maximum of 60,000 gallons is expected to be stored in any given tank farm at the facility (the remainder spread among the other tank farms).  This corresponds to approximately 19,500 pounds of piperidine on-site in the waste NMP process.\r\n\r\nThere are no other processes at the facility currently storing, handling, using, or processing chemicals in quantities sufficient to require their inclusion in this RMP.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Facility\r\n\r\nVeolia is committed to protect their employees, the public and the environment.

The fire-fighting equipment can be remotely controlled via Wi-Fi connections. \r\n\r\nHigh level alarms are present on the tanks (activate at 80% full), with sight gauges to prevent overfilling. All unloading of wastes and loading of blended materials are conducted over concrete. A high level alarm must be responded to with a manual pump shutdown for truck-to-tank transfers. Operator attention is also a major spill and leak prevention measure used at the facility. \r\n\r\nA facility-specific Compliance Management System (CMS) is used to track items such as annual requirements for testing waste tank wall thickness. Over 600 compliance elements are currently programed into the CMS (e.g., self-inspections, housekeeping). \r\n\r\nVeolia has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
