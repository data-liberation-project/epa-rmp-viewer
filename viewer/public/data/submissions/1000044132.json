      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nVeolia Environmental Services (Veolia) operates a fully permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) and fuels blending facility in Henderson, Colorado.  The facility receives waste materials, primarily organic solvent wastes, from various manufacturers.  Once on-site, the waste materials are separated into various waste and product categories depending on how the material will be processed.  Certain types of wastes are treated and processed in order to recover products that may be reused/recycled by industrial customers.  Other wastes are prepared for shipment to other Veolia or non-Veolia facilities for additional treatment or disposal. \n\n\n\nThere are (will be) two particular processes at the facility that have the capacity to store a regulated chemical (piperidine) in a quantity sufficient to require the preparation and implementation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The two processes will be performed on an event basis for one year.  This RMP plan will be terminated at the end of the one year.  Process 1 involves the storage/handling & recovery/recycling of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).  Starting in August 2014, crude NMP containing 1.25% piperidine will be delivered to Veolia and stored in fourteen (14) temporary 21,000 gallon frac tanks.  The NMP in the frac tanks is run through an existing distillation unit to recover the NMP which is then sent back to the PSM regulated stationary tanks located among the facility's existing tank farms.  The recovered NMP is then distributed as a product to customers.  Waste piperidine generated from the recovery process in the form of condensate and still bottoms will be shipped off for treatment and disposal at third party facilities.  Assuming all 14 frac tanks are in operation and all NMP contains 1.25% piperidine, it is estimated that approximately 31,000 pounds of piperidine may be present on-site in the NMP recycling process. \n\n\n\nPr"

Waste NMP will be stored in stationary tanks located among the facility's existing tank farms.  A maximum of 100,000 gallons of waste NMP is expected to be stored at the facility containing 3.75% piperidine, though a maximum of 60,000 gallons is expected to be stored in any given tank farm at the facility (the remainder spread among the other tank farms).  This corresponds to approximately 19,500 pounds of piperidine on-site in the waste NMP process.\n\n\n\nThere are no other processes at the facility currently storing, handling, using, or processing chemicals in quantities sufficient to require their inclusion in this RMP.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Facility\n\n\n\nVeolia is committed to protect their employees, the public and the environment.

The Director of Health and Safety has the authority to develop and require implementation of corporate-wide safety and health programs to promote a safe, healthful work environment and to promote regulatory compliance.  At the regional level, the Regional Vice President has executive responsibility to safely manage all operations in the region for which they have responsibility.
