The facility was completed and began packaging operation in 1998. The facility is\r\nsituated on approximately 9 acres located at 334 Tidal Road in Deer Park, Texas 77536.\r\n\r\n1.2 ACIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\r\nDelta Deer Park is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is\r\ninherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\r\ninstillation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes. It is\r\nDelta's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated\r\nsubstances. Delta has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\r\n\r\n1.3 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\nThe Delta Deer Park facility's primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of\r\nchemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below. Delta Deer Park\r\nreceives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars and iso tanks and transfers them to\r\n55-gallon drums, 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers. Filled containers are then\r\nwarehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications. Inventory is dependent upon\r\ncustomer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite. Typical Safety\r\nData Sheets (SDS) are provided for all predicted regulated substances in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nChemical: \t\t\t\tCAS No.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:\r\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate (TDI) \t\t584-84-9\r\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate (TDI)\t\t91-08-7\r\nEthylenediamine \t\t\t107-15-3\r\nVinyl Acetate\t\t\t\t108-05-4\r\n\r\n1.4 THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nDelta Deer Park is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a\r\nregulated substance in a"

The plan is updated regularly to reflect\r\nrelevant changes taking place within the process that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n1.8 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nDelta Deer Park has a continuous improvement policy in place that includes safety improvement.\r\n\r\n1.9 CERTIFICATION STATEMENT\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information\r\nsubmitted is true, accurate, and complete."

Delta Deer Park is a Program 2 level\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp program was used\r\nto evaluate off-site consequences. RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations\r\nprovided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following\r\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the regulated chemicals involves the catastrophic failure of the largest\r\nvessel containing the regulated substance at the facility.  For the materials Ethylenediamine and Toluene 2,4 Diisocyanate the event is the release from a rail car (est. 20,600 gallons).  For Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate and Vinyl Acetate, it's the release from a 6,600 gallon container.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all RMP-covered process chemicals, the alternative case scenario selected was a 3 hose with a 1 puncture while filling at 93.4\u00b0F that leaks for 15 minutes. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.5 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICALSPECIFIC\r\nPREVENTION STEPS\r\nDelta Deer Park has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is\r\nnot subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Delta Deer Park is subject to\r\nEPCRA Section 313 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe elements of\r\nthe release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDelta Deer Park maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\r\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Review\r\nThis facility conducts process hazard reviews to ensure that hazards associated with the process are\r\nidentified and controlled efficiently.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment,\r\noperating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nDelta Deer Park conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the\r\nRMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any\r\ncorrective actions as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nDelta Deer Park promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in\r\na catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the\r\nroot cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring.\r\nReports are retained in the web-based CMS system.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nDelta Deer Park believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the\r\nincident prevention process. Delta employees have access to the information created as part of\r\nfacility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard\r\nanalyses.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction\r\nactivities. Delta Deer Park has a policy of informing the contactors of known potential hazards\r\nrelated to the contactor's works. Contractors are also informed of emergency procedures prior to the start of any on-site work.\r\n\r\n1.6 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere has been no reportable release of RMP chemicals at the Delta Deer Park site over the past 5 years, nor have there been any injuries associated with exposure to covered RMP chemicals.\r\n\r\n1.7 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nDelta Deer Park has a written emergency response plan for responding to accidental release"
