Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Sealed Air Corporation - Renton facility  has many policies and procedures to ensure the safe operation of its facilities. Some of these include the written operating procedures describing how to execute a task safely, training employees on the procedures that are needed to perform their jobs, training employees how to respond to emergencies, , and empowering employees to shut down activities that they believe are unsafe.  In addition, the Renton facility has implemented an accidental release prevention policy which integrated containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operating/emergency procedures to notify local emergency/fire authorities,  and management practices.  The applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are followed.  \r\n\r\n2 .  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled.\r\nSealed Air Corporation - Renton facility manufactures light weight foam packaging used in the consumer industry.  The plant uses propane as a blowing agent to make plastic foam.  This is the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location.  Propane (CAS 74-98-6) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline.  Propane is used and stored as a liquid, but is released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst and Alternative Case Scenarios.\r\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by EPA assumes out storage tank completely fails, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditions exist, the vapors find an ignition source and released forms a gas explosion.  The endpoint is 1 psi over-pressure is 0.3 miles.  The alternative release scenario is more credible scenario based on an analysis of potential hazards at our faculty.  Maximum release is approximately 4650 pounds from a catastrophic failure of the delivery piping system.  The impact distances is based on maximum distance at which the rad"

SAC- Renton employees and contractors receive training on the Emergency Response Plan for initial assignment, and or when their responsibilities with respect to the Plan are changed; and or whenever the Emergency Response Plan is revised. Additionally, employees are also involved in facility drills to test the emergency capabilities and response on an annual basis."
