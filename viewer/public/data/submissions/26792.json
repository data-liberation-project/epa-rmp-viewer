We invest significant resources in accident prevention, such as, considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  We implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a release should occur, personnel are training to mitigate the release and evacuate the facility if necessary.  Additionally, we have reviewed our facility with local emergency responders to familiarize them with our site and on how to respond to emergencies at our location. \r\n\r\nThe Echo Springs plant is a Program Level 1 and has no reportable releases in the 5-year accident history records that resulted in onsite or offsite consequences.  Furthermore, ESP does not process, produce, or use any of the regulated \"Toxic\" substances above the threshold quantities.  There are no environmental or public receptors within the flammable, vapor-cloud explosion, for the worst-case scenario at a1-psi endpoint of 0.5 miles.   \r\n\r\n2.0 Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Echo Springs Plant, located near Wamsutter, Wyoming, processes natural gas and produces NGL and pipeline quality residue gas, through three Cryogenic plants (P1, P2 and P3).  Temporary storage of the NGL is in five (5) bullet tanks that are used only during pipeline interruptions.  \r\n\r\nThe facility processes the following regulated flammable substances (occurring as a mixture):\r\n\t\t\t\t CAS#\r\n\t\tMethane   \t74-82-8\r\n\t\tEthane\t\t74-84-0\r\n\t\tPropane\t74-98-6\r\n\t\tButane\t\t106-97-8\r\n\t\tIsobutane\t75-28-5\r\n\t\tPentane\t109-66-0\r\n\t\tIsopentane\t78-78-4\r\n\r\nEcho Springs Processing Plant is a Program Level 1 and there are no regulated Toxic substances processed, produce"

The maximum distance to a 1-psi endpoint is 0.5 miles from one of the equally sized tanks.  The endpoint was determined by application of the EPA's OCAG methodology. \r\n\r\nAlthough the Product Storage Tanks are normally below 5% full and the area is diked, the WCS was calculated at full inventory and without considering the dike's passive mitigation. Full inventory is held below the maximum capacity of the tank at 80% capacity by the following administrative controls:\r\n\r\n1. High level alarm at 126 inches when tanks are in service. \r\n2. Tanks are closely monitored visually on local sight glasses by operations personnel when in use.\r\n\r\nPlant personnel are instructed and trained to respond to the release. Should the WCS occur, the following response would be implemented:\r\n1. Activate emergency shutdown of both processing units and activate the siren to evacuate all personnel from the facility.\r\n2. Lead Operator evacuates the facility with the emergency response/incident commander kit. \r\n3. Incident command is established at the WCS end point. (Tee in the road)\r\n4.

This summary addresses each of the RMP elements required for a Program Level 1 process and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n4.1 Employee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Williams Echo Springs Gas Processing Plant employees participate in all facets of facility safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include participation in:"

Echo has a local Safety Committee, composed of hourly and salaried personnel, that review accidents, review safety audits, and address safety related issues to identify hazards and prevent accidents.  As a part of RMP, the facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which improves the safety for the employees and protects the environment at the facility.\r\n\r\n4.2 Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Williams Echo Springs Gas Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, an inventory of chemicals stored on-site, and the equipment design basis information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  The storage and process equipment have documented safety related limits for specific parameters (pressure, overfill, leak detection, and volume received).  The process is maintained using process controls, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and emergency shutdown devices.\r\n\r\nWilliams Energy Services maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and constr"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n4.3 Hazard Review\r\n\r\nThe team members have conducted several thorough hazard reviews, using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this review.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical, and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and /or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe team findings are forwarded to local and regional management for resolution.    Implementation of mitigation options in response to the hazard review findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard review information at least every five years.  These periodic reviews are conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from t"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Echo Spring's facilities maintain a process parameter document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in operations and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n4.5 Training\r\n\r\nThe written procedures are an integral part of the Operator comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the gas processing facilities. New employees receive basic instruction in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with another operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently once they met the minimum requirements.  Subsequent to initial training, all operators receive periodic refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that t"

The basic elements of this program include:  (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) inspections and tests, (4) correction of identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  These activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that the equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment are within acceptable limits (adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, if possible, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Echo Spring's facilities incorporate quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\n4.7 Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nWilliams Field Services Company is committed to, not only establishing an effective Process Safety Management Program, but also continuously improving the program.\r\nA comprehensive audi"

Copies of the findings are filed for at least two years and are available upon request. \r\n\r\n4.8 Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Echo Spring's personnel investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage (greater than $250.000.00), environmental loss, or personnel injury.  The goal of the investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to local and regional management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\n5.0\tCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe following is a description of safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\n5.1 Universal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention programs summarized previously are applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Echo Spring's facilities.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment or human errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2 Specialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Echo Spring's faciltites have specific safety features on the process equipment that perform"

      "SummaryText": "the following:  (1) control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n1. Fire Eyes to detect fires in their incipient stages and shutdown the facility.\r\n2. High Temperature melt-outs to detect fire and shutdown the facility.\r\n3. Gas Detection located inside the process buildings to detect gas, which activates a plant shutdown. (20% LEL alarm  40% LEL. Emergency Shutdown)\r\n\r\n5.2.1 Release Detection\r\n\r\nGas detection is located inside the processing buildings, which are located to detect gas at the floor or overhead depending on the type of gas.(Lighter or heavier than air) Operations personnel continuously monitor the facilities through a distributed control system and visual inspection during rounds. \r\n\r\n5.2.2 Release Control\r\n\r\nAll the facilities have Emergency Shutdowns to isolate the facilities in case of a release. The shutdown devices isolate the facilities and isolate power to all equipment to prevent ignition sources during a release situation.\r\n\r\n5.2.3 Release Mitigation\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained to be first responders and incident commanders. In addition, we have a site-specific spill prevention control and countermeasure plan for controlling, and reporting of spills.\r\n\r\n6.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Echo Spring's facilities have an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Over the last 5 years there has not been any release involving a regulated substance that has resulted in significant on-site or off-site effects.\r\n\r\n7.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nThe Echo Spring's facilities maintain a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of fire or explosion.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency"

      "SummaryText": "response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The processing facilities also have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modification made to the facility process.  The regional safety administrators administer the emergency response program.  When changes are made to the program, employees are informed and trained on the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program of the Echo Spring's facilities is coordinated with the local fire department and the Carbon County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meeting with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Echo Spring's personnel have communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Echo Spring's personnel conduct an annual review of the facility and process/regulated substance hazards with local emergency responders. \r\n\r\n8.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\tThe Echo Spring's Plant will continue safety by practicing Process Safety Management and all of its elements.\r\n\r\nI, insert name, representing Williams Echo Springs Gas Processing Plant, located near Wamsutter, Wyoming, certify that, based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint fo"

      "SummaryText": "r the worst case accidental release scenario, for the following processes (P1, P2 and P3) is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor: Within the past five years, the processes have had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program (40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1) ). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of a fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the ERP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information is true, accurate, and complete."
