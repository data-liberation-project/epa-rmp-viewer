MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert A. Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWDSC has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\nSkinner Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.

As discussed in the Executive Summary of the June 2004 RMP submission under \u00bfPlanned Changes to Improve Safety,\u00bf MWDSC decided to modify the Skinner Plant Chlorination Facility with a chlorine containment and scrubbing system to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release.  The decision to install the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, which is equipped with two chlorine vapor scrubbing systems was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility is now completed and the modified Chlorine System contained in that facility is in operation.\n\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the newly modified Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

The plant is situated northeast of the I-15 and 215-freeway junction.  The facility was constructed in 1976 and covers 345 acres adjacent to Lake Skinner.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.

The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras and chlorine leak detectors. Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator\u00bfs console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.

The water treatment plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the plant, including the Chlorine System and scrubber units, in the event of a power failure.\n\nThe control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, year round.  Access to the plant is through guarded security gates, which are closed after regular hours when the plant is patrolled by security guards.  The Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility is monitored by video cameras from the control room and has door alarms.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Skinner Plant during the last five years.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Skinner Plant complies with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.  The Skinner Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?\tDetailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n?\tComprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n?\tComprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n?\tPerformance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n?\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n?\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n?\tHi"

This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process. Specifications for chlorine process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  Skinner Plant also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1992, 1995, and 1998 detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The 1998 RMP PHA was further reviewed and updated in February 2004 as part of the five-year RMP Program update.  An additional PHA was conducted in June 2006 as part of the chlorine containment and scrubber modification project (i.e., Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility d"

The Skinner Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSkinner Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Skinner Plant chlorine system.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Skinner Plant during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nSkinner Plant has Operational Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond to emergency chlorine releases only to ass"

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Skinner Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Skinner Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.  Specially trained Skinner Plant employees will be available during such a chlorine emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1995, 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Skinner Plant.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in February 2004, when the 1998 RMP process hazard analysis was reviewed and updated.  The changes proposed, which have now been implemented, most prominent among them is a new Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers, which are a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. Further changes were identified in June 2006 and September 2007, when the process hazard and seismic risk analyses were updated to include the new chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and will be resolved in a timely fashion."
