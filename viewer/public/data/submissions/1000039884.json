Energy Transfer operates natural gas processing plants in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.    The Coyanosa gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained operating personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nThe facility receives raw natural gas from the field for processing.  The natural gas is treated to remove carbon dioxide, H2S and water.  The natural gas is then demethanized and separated into methane and natural gas liquids.  Methane and natural gas liquids are transported from the facility via two separate pipelines.  A flammable mixture (Natural Gas Liquids) is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is stored at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Coyanosa Plant is located northwest of Fort Stockton, in Pecos County, Texas, at coordinates of Latitude 31 degrees 1' 27\" and Longitude 102 degrees 59' 22\".  \n\n\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, the worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the natural gas liquid i"

Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.21 mile.  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \n\n\n\nAlthough we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  \n\n\n\nWe have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Pecos County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.   Coyanosa Plant operates under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety has helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n* Hydrogen sulfide monitors were installed around the sulfur treatment plant and the sulfur recovery plant which will sound an audible alarm upon detection of high hydrogen sulfide concentrations.\n\n\n\n* Lower Explosive Limit monitors were installed in the engine room.\n\n\n\n* Manually operated emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons are located near all the facility gates in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n* The natural gas flare is lit continuously.\n\n\n\nThese safeguards, as well as the vig"

Daily emphasis on prevention and safety programs should ensure this record continues.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) specific to the facility is in place and has been coordinated with the Fort Stockton Fire Department and the Pecos County Sheriff's Department.  The Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  The ERP in place deals with evacuation procedures, training, etc.  The ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Coyanosa Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\n* The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\n* The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n* The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n\n\n* Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\n* An ongoing dialogue with the Pecos County Emergency Management Director or their designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the"
