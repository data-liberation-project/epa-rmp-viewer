ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY \nRESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Union Carbide Taft/Star Complex is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareO requirements and governmental requirements, such as, the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n \n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nUnion Carbide?s Taft /Star Plant is a petrochemical manufacturing facility that converts petroleum-based raw materials into a variety of basic building block and intermediate chemicals for customers in many parts of the world.  The facility also produces polyethylene plastic pellets that are shipped worldwide. \n\nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Taft /Star Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  . The Union Carbide Taft/Star Complex has 17 chemicals in threshold quantities encompassed by this rule. They are as follows: Acetaldehyde (f) , Acrolein (t), Ammonia (t) , Butadiene (f) , Butene (f) , Ethane (f) , Ethyl Ether (f) , Ethylene (f) , Ethylene Oxide (t) , Ethylenediamine (t)  , Hydrogen (f) , Isopentane (f) , Methyl Mercaptan (t) , Peracetic Acid (t) , Propane (f), Propylene (f), Vinyl Methyl "

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario. General steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring and to mitigate their effects should they occur appear in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemical (s)\n \n    Worst-case Release Scenario(s)\n\nAcrolein - This scenario assumes an instantaneous failure of the tank walls and safety systems releases the entire contents of a 186,000 lb. tank in 10 minutes, with the worst possible weather conditions ( no wind, low humidity).

Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n?

Information is shared  with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release from our facility. Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S. The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the St. Charles Parish Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Taft / Star Complex to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n- Reduce the volume of stored ammonia by 50% with a change in operating philosophy to use only one tank of liquid ammonia versus two. Also, install magnetic sight glass in the ammonia storage area which reduces the possibility of an amm"
