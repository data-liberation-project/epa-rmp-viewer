      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Navajo Refining Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur Artesia facility's primary activities encompass Petroleum refining.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane, Propane and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid].  Butane is used for Alkylation Unit feed and gasoline feed stock.  Propane is used for Alkylation Unit feed and LPG product.  Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] is used to enhance the alkylation reaction.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Butane at our facility is 6,846,042 lb. while Propane and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] are present at our Artesia refinery in quantities of 1,037,000 lbs. and 128,794 lbs. respectively.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and RMP Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from HF Alkylation.  In this scenario 13,900 lb. of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [H"

      "SummaryText": "ydrofluoric acid] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] involves a release from HF Alkylation.  The scenario involves the release of 1390 lb. of hydrogen fluoride.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by a water deluge system.  This active mitigation system has the effect of reducing the release by approximately 90% (i.e., to 1,390 lb).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] is 1.0 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Butane Bulk Storage.  In this scenario 1,983,744 lb. of Butane is released.   It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 1.01 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Butane  Bulk Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  The scenario involves the release of 18000.00 lb. of Butane in  minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability l"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  The refinery has an active program in place to maintain compliance eith the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nNavajo Refining Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If or HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/29/2007.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Navajo Refining Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nNavajo Refining Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provide"
