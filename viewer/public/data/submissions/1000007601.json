Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and/or their supervisor.  The Maintenance Manager and/or supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 7409 West Central Avenue in Fresno, California, which is located approximately 4 miles south of California Highway 180 and 6 miles west of Californ"

The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of wine products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses approximately 92,600 pounds of ammonia in its two ammonia refrigeration systems.  The two systems are physically connected by piping, but have been locked out and separated permanently from each other.  The Front (West) System has an ammonia charge of approximately 61,600 pounds; the Back (East) System has an ammonia charge of approximately 31,000 pounds. The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n \r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\r\n- In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\r\n- Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n- Training is pr"

Such RMP accidents would involve either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. The Wine Group - Fresno realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria. We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and are internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.  Details of the RMP reportable accident are as follows:\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 2012, a flanged dead leg in a section of ammonia transfer piping over-pressurized resulting in the failure of the gasket sealing the flange.  The gasket failure resulted in the release of a combined 2,600 pounds of gaseous and liquid ammonia.  The wind was blowing southeast at the beginning of the incident, but later shifted towards southwest.  The release resulted in the call for shelter-in place for off-site surrounding residential properties within a one-mile radius (11 people based on 2010 census data from MARPLOT), and one minor on-site inhalation injury.\r\n\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMP"
