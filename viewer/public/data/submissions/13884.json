These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific employees within the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.  This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that  they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant, located at 3540 Teinert Road, Giddings TX, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, & condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 60 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel containing 76,194 pounds of a propane, ethane mix. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.35 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\nThe Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) associated with a release of flammable material at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving an inventory level of 80% of the largest process vessel (65,257 po"

No passive mitigation measures were taken in to account in evaluating this ARS.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the process has had no accidental release that caused onsight or offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.42.(a)).\n\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant.  Because processes at the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, The North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including ope"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant primarily uses the What If / Checklist (DP-10) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and  retained.  Once again, the team findings are for"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive initial training in North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n Pre-startup Reviews\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally read.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance  function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\n\n Safe Work Practices\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.   Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team=s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documen"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The plant was started up in January of 1999 and compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. The facility will become part of the strict audit schedule for other DEFS facilities now in place.  Audits will meet the following standard requirements: Personnel from other gas plants will make up the Audit Team.  Both hourly and staff personnel will participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit teams findings are traced until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nSummary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Findings\n\nThe processes at the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP  covered processes at the North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe North Fayette Gas Sweetening Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, a"
