      "SummaryText": "The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. is a manufacturer of feed grade L-lysine, an animal feed additive.  The lysine is manufactured using an industrial fermentation process.  The lysine is subsequently extracted, purified, packaged, and distributed to animal feed manufacturers and animal growers throughout North America.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used extensively at Heartland Lysine, Inc. for pH control in the fermentation process and in the extraction process.  \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. is committed to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the industrial use of hazardous materials.\n\nWe have taken steps to ensure that the anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility.  Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safety and proper operation.  Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia.  Many of our employees have been trained to the Hazmat Technician Level, which allows quick response to any chemical problems that may develop.  Our readiness is maintained with periodic chemical release drills.\n\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. has in place an extensive emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and the professional Hazmat team stationed in Ottumwa, Iowa, 17 miles away.  \n\nThis preparation, planning, inspection, and training gives the employees of Heartland Lysine, Inc. the confidence to know that we can manage the risks associated with using ammonia in our industrial process.  \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nAs part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) Heartland Lysine, Inc. is required to prepare a worst case release scenario and an alternative case release scenario.  \n\nOur procedures require that ammonia tanks will be filled"

      "SummaryText": " to no more than 85% capacity.  This is to allow safe expansion of the material with changes in temperature.  Heartland Lysine, Inc.'s worst case scenario consists of the failure of one anhydrous ammonia tank filled to 85% capacity.  The failure of one such tank would release 22,500 gallons of liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  The toxic cloud of ammonia would reach offsite public receptors.  No environmental receptors would be reached.  \n\nHeartland Lysine Inc.'s alternative case release scenario consists of a truck transfer hose failing during the unloading of a truck of ammonia into the storage tank.  Although this scenario has never occurred at Heartland Lysine, Inc., this scenario was selected because it was felt that this was a credible scenario that could possibly happen.  Using guidance found in \"The Fertilizer Institute's Retail Guidance Document for EPA's Risk Management Plan,\" it was estimated that approximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia would be released.  The toxic cloud of ammonia from the alternative release scenario would reach offsite public receptors.  No environmental receptors would be reached.  \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. has implemented mechanisms to help prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The system is inspected according to industry guidelines to ensure its integrity.  Employees handling anhydrous ammonia are trained in the safe handling of the chemical and in the containment and clean op of any releases.  \n\nThe Five Year Accident History\nHeartland Lysine Inc. has not had a reportable release of ammonia in the last five years.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. has in place a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.  The program has been coordinated with the local fire department, other adjacent industrial facilities, and with the LEPC.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program is designed to alert our employees, contractors, public safe"

We have made the necessary safety information available for all stakeholders in the event of an accidental release.  \n\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. has the necessary equipment on site to deal with most releases.  Employees have access to, and are trained in the proper operation of self contained breathing apparatus, and Level A fully encapsulated chemical suits.  Any release beyond our capabilities will be handled by the Ottumwa Regional Hazmat Team.  \n\nHeartland Lysine, Inc. has installed ammonia sensors that monitor the environment surrounding the storage tanks 24 hours a day.  These sensors will alert employees to a release such that they may take immediate action.  Employees are able to turn off pumps and close valves remotely to mitigate a release.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nImproving industrial safety is an endless process.  Heartland Lysine, Inc. is always looking for ways to improve the level of safety to protect our employees, the public, and the environment.  One way to improve safety is to continuously train our employees.  We are improving our training programs to address the specific safety and health issues and safe work practices involved with the industrial use of ammonia."
