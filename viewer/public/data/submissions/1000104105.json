The regulator is also designed to relieve the pressure from the system.\nGaseous chlorine is drawn through a roto meter, manual control valve, and a differential pressure regulator, to a water ejector.  The chlorine roto meter is set manually to desired feed rate.  Feed rate depends on ambient weather conditions and the quantity of water processed.  Chlorine gas is mixed with water from the high service pump discharge line as the gas passes into the water stream at the water ejector.  The chlorine feed equipment is inspected/repaired/replaced yearly by Sidener Environmental.\n\nThe water system is monitored manually for chlorine residual every two hours and continuously with W&T/Evoqua Depolox 3 plus Residual Analyzer.  Monitoring occurs on top of the filters, clearwell, and post high service pumps to assure that the proper amount of chlorine is present to effectively disinfect the water supply.  Depending on the results of the monitoring, the chlorine feed rate is manually adjusted to maintain sufficient chlorine for disinfection.\nChlorine cylinders are delivered to the chlorine storage room on flatbed trucks as needed.  The cylinders are loaded and unloaded from the truck using an overhead crane hoist.  Water Plant personnel are trained to perform the loading and unloading activities.\n\nIn case of a power outage, the Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a standby diesel generator to continue to operate all Water Treatment Plant processes."

      "SummaryText": "The City of Highland Water Treatment Plant uses gaseous chlorine to disinfect the drinking water supply at the in accordance with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Regulations.  One chlorination system is installed at the Water Treatment Plant.\n\nWithin the chlorine cylinder building at Water Treatment Plant, liquid chlorine is stored in three 1-ton cylinders.  One cylinder is normally in service, and two may be in standby mode for use when the contents of the in-service cylinder are depleted.  Chlorine leak detection and warning are provided by an alarm.  The alarm sounds at the Water Treatment Plant when chlorine is detected by the sensor, located just off the floor.  The chlorine cylinder storage area has an exhaust fan and vent system, controlled manually, to evacuate chlorine before personnel entry.  \nChlorine cylinders are moved in and out of the storage room with an overhead crane hoist.  The crane hoist operates on a fixed beam with \u201cstops\u201d to prevent it from traveling too far.  The chlorine cylinders sit on a chlorine scale.\n\nIn the building two (2) chlorinator meters feed gaseous chlorine into makeup water.  The makeup water carries gaseous chlorine to three possible feed points.  The Water Treatment Plant is capable of feeding at the raw water intake, filter influent, and filter effluent (pre-clearwell).  The Water Treatment Plant is staffed 16 hours/day Monday through Friday and 12 hours/day Saturday, Sunday, & holidays.\n\nChlorine gas is supplied from the in-service chlorine cylinder at a system pressure of approximately 62 psig to 75 psig to a vacuum regulator mounted directly to the cylinder gas supply valve.  A vacuum regulator is on each tank.  When one tank is empty the valve on the tank is closed, and a valve on \u201cnew\u201d tank is opened.  The vacuum regulator reduces the pressure from the cylinder by using a water ejector to create a vacuum within the system.  The regulator is designed to fail \u201cclosed\u201d any time a loss of vacuum is experienced"
