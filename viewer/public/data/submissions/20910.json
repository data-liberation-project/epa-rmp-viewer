Facility Accidental Release Policy \n\nThe owners, management, and employees of The McGregor Company along with the crew of the Southwick facility located at P-1, Nez Perce County Road Southwick, Idaho 83537 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,  the McGregor Company and the Southwick retail facility are prepared to work with the local fire department, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nNOTE: See planned changes to improve safety.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\no    The primary activity at the facility is the storage, and handling of anhydrous and aqua, ammonia.\n\no    Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed as agricultural grade fertilizer to local farmers.\n\no    Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck  and stored in one above ground tank(s)  .The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia handled is 91,800 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.    Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios   \nThe worst-case release scenario involves the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulations. The scenario at this facility would release 73,440 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 2.04. This figure comes from TFI's DEGADIS model.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, is based on the most likely potential incident that might occur at this facility. We used the scenario that a 2\" transfer hose would break and release 26,638 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.56 miles. This figure comes from TFI's DEGADIS model.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Relea"

Five-year Accident History\n    a.    There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, in the past five years that:\n\no    Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\no    have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Action Policy \nThe facility's emergency action policy was written in accordance with the following\nRegulations:\n\no    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n    o    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120;\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Facility Accidental Release Policy.\n    The McGregor Company and its 37 retail fertilizer facilities located in Washington, Idaho and Oregon have an outstanding record on safety and environmental issues. We have an excellent safety and maintenance program and have won several regional, State and national environmental respect awards. Safety and environmental improvements are an ongoing process for the McGregor Company and all of its retail fertilizer facilities.\n\nNOTE:\n    As a result of the RMP program the McGregor Company will be developing new plans and policies to protect the people who work at our facilities, our neighbors and the environment. At this time The McGregor Company would ask for an exemption on filing an Emergency Response Plan.  We ask that the McGregor Company be exempt until Dec. 31 1999. We apply for this exemption because of information received from EPA 10th District 112 r coordinator. During this time we will develop "
