In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics:  Methyl Chloride, Phosphorous Trichloride\n\nFlammables:  Dimethylamine (anhydrous), Methylamine (anhydrous)\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nKey Off Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.

Methyl Chloride is used to produce methyl based quaternary ammonium compounds at the facility.  This is the only storage tank for Methyl Chloride and the release is contained within a concrete dike.

The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) is 3.2 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 231,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  DMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Dimethylamine and the release is contained within a concrete dike.

Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Evonik employees, Lanxess employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Matheson Gas employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.028 mg/l) is 0.40 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model, and the estimated duration of the release to the atmosphere is 40 minutes.\n\n\n\nMethyl Chloride (MeCl) (Toxic Gas)\n\nAn alternate case scenario selected is a 0.5 inch diameter rupture in a rail car unloading hose that releases 5,000 pounds of MeCl.  The release is contained within a concrete sump.  This area is equipped with fire fighting equipment.

The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.082mg/l) is 0.20 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model, and the estimated duration of the release to the atmosphere is 20 minutes.  \n\n\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nMethylamine\n\n\n\nOne alternate case selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 170,000 pounds of anhydrous Methylamine (MMA) resulting in a vapor liquid explosion.  MMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Methylamine and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equipment.  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Ingredion employees, Evonik employees, Lanxess employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Matheson gas employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  Assuming the released MMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.40 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\n\n\nMethylamine\n\n\n\nAnother alternate case scenario selected is a 0.5 inch diameter rupture in a 2 inch storage tank transfer line that releases 5,000 pounds of anhydrous Methylamine (DMA).  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Evonik employees, Lanxess Corporation employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Matheson employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  Assuming the released MMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.05 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.  \n\n\n\nDimethylamine\n\n\n\nThe alternate case scenario selected is a 0.5 inch diameter rupture in a 2 inch storage tank transfer line that releases 5,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethyla"
