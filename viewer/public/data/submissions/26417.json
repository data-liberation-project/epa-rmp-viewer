We operate under the policy for Environmental, Health and Safety of our parent company - General Electric.  The Spirit of the Letter states: \n\nGE is committed to achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence. This is a responsibility of management and employees in all functions. GE will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business. Our programs must combine clear leadership by management, the participation of all employees and functions, and the use of appropriate technology in developing and distributing GE products and services.\n\nRequirements\n-Comply with applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations.\n-Take appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, and to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment. Consider evolving industry practices, regulatory requirements and societal standards of care.\n-Assess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project. Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of GE?s products and services.\n-Eliminate unreasonable risks from GE?s facilities, products, services and activities.  \n-To the extent reasonably practicable, reduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution, and conserve, recover and recycle materials.\n-Continue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of GE?s operational strategy.\n\nFacility Description And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGE Betz Inc. manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals, primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers and cooling towers.  \nMost of our products are formulated by blending "

Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000-gallon truckload quantities.\nSimilarly, our raw materials, which we receive from suppliers, come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\nThe GE Betz - Orange Plant covers 12.63 acres of property, of which 2.14 acres are used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot or open lawn, or idle areas.\n\nAt the facility, cyclohexylamine and ethylendiamine are the two regulated liquid chemicals stored on-site in 55-gallon drums.  Cyclohexylamine neutralizes acids as a corrosion inhibitor, which makes it particularly useful for our boiler product lines. Ethylenediamine prevents the release of hydrogen sulfide vapor from oil in refinery processes. These raw materials are stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) And The Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nWithin the cyclohexylamine and ethylenediamine drum storage process, our \"Worst Case\" event involves a scenario where the contents of several drums are lost as an instantaneous release to an uncontained pavement outdoors during material transfer.  Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, these scenarios would have an offsite consequence.  Although these materials are normally stored in a protected containment area when not in transit, for the purposes of meeting the EPA requirements we did not consider any \"passive\" controls.  We also conservatively viewed that an amount of several drums would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release, even though our facility personnel are capable of respondi"

      "SummaryText": "ng to mitigate a release of this chemical in various ways.  \nBecause all plant operators are well trained in hazardous chemical handling procedures, forklift operation, and spill response, we think that a release event of this sort is unlikely to occur.\n\nAs an \"Alternative Scenario\" an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" involving cyclohexylamine or ethylenediamine, we considered a release event of a single drum, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that these scenarios would have an offsite consequence but it would be limited to a distance approximately half of the distance of the \"Worst Case\" scenario.  We choose to evaluate these scenarios because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline, although we feel an event involving a minor drum puncture of substantially less than a drum quantity would be more likely and would have no offsite consequences.\n\nEthylenediamine is also regulated under the production (blending) process. The \"Worst Case\" scenario of ethylenediamine in the blending process involves an instantaneous release of the contents of blending vessel containing the finished product with ethylenediamine as a major component. Due to the fact that the process is indoors with existing passive mitigation measures including enclosures, berms, trench and sump, a release of ethylenediamine vapors using the same EPA methodology is confined to the production room. Since there is no off-site consequence, no alternative scenario is required.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information "

The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAt the GE Betz - Orange Plant we have not had any accidental releases from the covered RMP processes that resulted in significant death, injury, property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage in the past 5 years due to the use or handling of cyclohexylamine.\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements:\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities\n- Quarterly inspections to determine any new sources of ignition and a check of safety control devices\n- Fire extinguisher training  \n- Fire drills conducted by our facility\n- Spill and release control instructions\n- Evacuation procedures and external response notifications\n- Incident coordination with local emergency responders\n- Incident analysis and review with all plant personnel, and identification of procedure changes\n- Annual program review and re-training \n- In applicable regions: Hurricane preparedness and plant readiness procedures\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nOur plans for safety improvement include: implementing a single layer-only operating practice, when transporting RMP-regulated substances on-site via forklift truck.
