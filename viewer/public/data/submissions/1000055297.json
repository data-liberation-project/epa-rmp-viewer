This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meetings with local emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy, which provides that:\r\na)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public;\r\nb)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards and procedures;\r\nc)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; and  \r\nd)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\r\n\r\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\r\n\r\nIt is Mosaic Fertilizer LLC's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mosaic has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\nRegulated toxic substances involved in the process include anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide; however, anhydrous ammonia is the only PSM/RMP regulated substance that exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  Sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully co"

The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personnel health as well as contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community. At the New Wales facility, ammonia is used as a raw material, stored in pressure vessels (called \"bullets\") as a liquefied gas. The ammonia is then piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP) and Granular mono-ammonium phosphate (GMAP) plants.  Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture.  Ammonia is brought into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline into four storage vessels (bullets).  The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons. \r\n\r\n3. General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's PSM Standard.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the New Wales Plant exceeds the OSHA PSM threshold for ammonia, so the New Wales Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements.  The New Wales ammonia process therefore satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule.  The New Wales plant has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\r\n3.1 Prevention Program\r\n\r\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n1. Process safety information. \r\n\r\nWe maintain a variety of technical documents to help ensure that our employees know about the hazards associated with our facility. These documents address (a) physical properties"

We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\r\n\r\n2. Process hazard analysis. \r\n\r\nWe perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\r\n\r\n3. Operating procedures. \r\n\r\nOur operators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \r\n\r\n4. Training. \r\n\r\nWe train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written, oral and skill demonstration reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\r\n\r\n5.

Management of change. \r\n\r\nWe evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program. This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n7. Pre-startup safety review. \r\n\r\nWe perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.

The ammonia bullets on site are visually inspected monthly and tested for thickness at appropriate intervals. The valves on the ammonia bullets piping are designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All ammonia lines transferring liquid or gaseous product are inspected for mechanical integrity at regular frequencies. All ammonia pressure relief valves are also maintained per API and ASME good engineering practices. Preventive maintenance is performed on all process equipment to ensure continuous operation without incident. Mosaic maintains an ammonia relief vent flare system that contains a self-igniter and is able to be run on an alternative fuel should a natural gas failure occur. These are just some of the measures which help Mosaic safeguard the employees, public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe New Wales PSM Review committee meets once a quarter to ensure the implementation and continuation of the entire PSM program.  This includes writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures; training for all operators and maintenance personnel; reviewing mechanical integrity, quality assurance, and management of change programs, and contractor safety programs; and developing an audit schedule which meets the OSHA PSM standard requirements.\r\n\r\n4.

The Emergency Response Program\r\nThe New Wales Plant has an emergency response program in place to address foreseeable emergency situations and incidents involving all hazardous substances on site.  The Emergency Response Plan establishes a mechanism for providing hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, external emergency response agencies, and the community.  The New Wales Emergency Response Program contains procedures for notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency response agencies about an accidental release.  It has been designed to advise all plant personnel how to respond to emergency situations and what their responsibilities are during emergencies.  The New Wales Plant has defined an emergency as a non-routine, unusual set of circumstances that call for immediate safety or environmental action.  The New Wales plant also has an Emergency Action Team on each shift that conduct training and practice drills with County emergency personnel.  These Teams are provided with appropriate personal protective and accident mitigation equipment to handle plant emergencies.\r\n\r\n6.
