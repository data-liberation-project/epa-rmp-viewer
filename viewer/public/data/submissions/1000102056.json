Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure integrity.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have not been  any accidental released of butane at the Dupont facility in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility is a non-responding facility.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process. As opportunities for improvement\nassociated with the new butane process arise at the Dupont Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Midstream Pipeline.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Dupont Facility is a butane storage, blending, and loading facility. The facility is located in Dupont, Colorado. The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane. Butane is held on-site in piping in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs for blending into gasoline. The maximum intended inventory is 9,031,753 lbs of butane.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Dupont Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with\nresources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design,\ninstallation, operations, and maintenance procedures. If an emergency were to occur, it is\nMagellan's policy to notify the Dupont terminal area LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe regulated butane blending process in the facility is compliant with all elements of the Risk\nManagement Program (RMP) and other employee training programs, along with operating and\nmaintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on"
