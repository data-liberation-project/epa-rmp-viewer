This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in \"Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification / Procedures\" and \"Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"  to address releases of ammonia.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to an ammonia release.  If an emergency were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThis facility is a poultry processing facility used to slaughter, cut-up, package, refrigerate and ship fresh poultry.  The facility receives live chickens which are slaughtered, processed and refrigerated for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in two (2) separate systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including drag freezers, evaporator units, water chillers, and ice makers.  The systems are identified as systems 1 and 2 and have maximum intended ammonia inventories of 55,539 and 26,425 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 81,964 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in ammonia refrigeration system 1 when it is operating with its maximum intended inventory of 55,539 pounds,  resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance based on RMP*Comp to an ammonia toxic endpoint is 4.4 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario based on RMP*Comp results "

The ammonia refrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past five years. \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to employ designated facility personnel to respond to the emergency.  Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled \"Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification / Procedures\" and \"Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\".  These personnel have received necessary response operations training in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations.  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the refrigeration systems."
