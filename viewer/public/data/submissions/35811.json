These include: operator training, written operating procedures, PM maintenance program, equipment inspection, OSHA PSM program including Process Hazards Analysis, contractor safety, employee participation, etc.  In addition, the Chlorine Unit is designed for safety.  The 600 ton chlorine storage tanks were fabricated per ASME code.  Materials of construction are important since wet chlorine is highly corrosive.  The materials in the chlorine unit follow the Chlorine Institute's recommendations.  Some of the main process control devices are: 1) a cell seal scrubber designed to neutralize any wet chlorine in the event of over pressurization of the cell header, 2) a pre-cooler bottoms dump procedure designed to prevent accumulation of the explosive impurity of nitrogen trichloride.",

We use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below:\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as (1) operating limits for the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and (3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes. Chemical information is documented within material safety data sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical.  This information typically includes: (1) toxicity information, (2) physical data, (3) reactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and chemical stability data, and (5) hazards of mixing substances together.  MSDS's are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrume"

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards. A hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented. We update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable s"

Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes. \n\n\nTRAINING\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks.  Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we strive to ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility.

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and (4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Vulcan-Geismar plant performs a pre-startup safety review, the extent of which is dictated by the complexity of the modification.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete, and (4) a process hazard analysis has been performed, if necessary.\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe Vulcan-Geismar plant trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injury to employees, the public, or the environment.

Our personnel regularly monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.  Infractions of safety procedures are grounds for craftsman or contractor expulsion.\n\n \nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but often is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with PSM, ACC Codes and  the RMP rule.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the Vulcan-Geismar plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.
