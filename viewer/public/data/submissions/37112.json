The company acquired an adjoining facility, the Shawinigan Resins facility, in 1963 - creating the current site.  The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982.  Solutia Inc. was formed in 1997 following a spin-off from Monsanto.  The site includes manufacturing units producing high value specialty products which include Saflex interlayer, Gelva adhesives, Butvar resin, Resimene coatings, as well as a Technical Center complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities.  In January, 2003, Surface Specialties Inc. purchased the Resimene coatings and Gelva adhesives business as well as portion of the Technical Center and pilot plant facilities.

In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nVinyl Acetate\n\nVinyl acetate is shipped in rail cars as a liquid to the Indian Orchard plant by suppliers.  An average of 4 rail cars of vinyl acetate are stored at the plant.  Solutia has strict unloading and handling procedures for the material.  The largest above ground storage tank holds 1,200,000 pounds.  Solutia?s Indian Orchard Plant uses vinyl acetate to make adhesives and in the manufacturing of polyvinyl butyral, a plastic interlayer used in laminated safety glass for automotive and architectural applications.\n     \nFormaldehyde\n\nFormaldehyde in a water solution (formalin) is shipped in tank trucks to the Indian Orchard Plant. Solutia has strict unloading and handling procedures for the material.  The largest above-ground storage tank of this material holds 700,000 pounds.  Solutia?s Indian Orchard Plant uses formaldehyde to make Resimene metal coatings used in automotive paints and other industrial applications. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts \nhelp us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the \npublic, and the environment by our use of these chemicals \n\n     \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n     \nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of \nhazardous chemicals.
