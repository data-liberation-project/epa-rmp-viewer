Solutia Inc. was formed in 1997 following a spin-off from Monsanto.  The site includes manufacturing units producing high value specialty products which include Saflex interlayer, Gelva adhesives, Butvar resin, Resimene coatings, as well as a Technical Center complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities.  In January, 2003, Surface Specialties Inc. purchased the Resimene coatings and Gelva adhesives business as well as portion of the Technical Center and pilot plant facilities.
