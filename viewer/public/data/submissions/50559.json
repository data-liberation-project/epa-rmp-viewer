Box 40\nElmwood, NE  68349\n\nRisk Management Plan \u00bf EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations. In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable to the specific incident. \n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 424510, \u00bfestablishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\u00bf. However, we are also engaged in providing \u00bfagricultural inputs\u00bf that include the receiving, storage and reloading of anhydrous ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. The NAICS code we feel is most applicable to this activity is 493130, \u00bffarm product warehousing and storage\u00bf. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs. The facility is also operated on an \u00bfas needed\u00bf basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading process. Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times of day and night. \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe maximum quantity released and the distance to endpoint calculations have been shared with the appropriate emergency planning and response agencies. Possible public and environmental receptors with the area have been provided to the Nemaha County LEPC for their consideration. \n\nAlternate Case Scenario:\n\nThis facility is new and there has not been an actual release of anhydrous ammonia on which to base this scenario. We decided to use a transfer hose rupture incident for this scenario and the quantity released and the distance to endpoint calculations have been shared with the a"

We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and have installed safety equipment including but not limited to: Excess flow valves. Emergency valves, Emergency couplers at transfer points, Protection from vehicular damage for the storage tank and attached piping, and Security locking mechanisms to prevent vandalism when the site is unattended. We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers, and visitor protection. This plan initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for this anhydrous ammonia facility and the employees that staff it. \n\nAdditional Information:\n\nFor additional information, response to questions,  or comments please contact:\n\nSafety Department\tat\t(402) 227-2715"
