      "SummaryText": "A.  Texon is committed to the safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training.  Texon has created a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  It has also developed an emergency action plan and coordinated these efforts with local emergency responders (local fire department).\n\nB.  Texon L.P. operates a propane transfer terminal in Lordstown, Ohio.  Propane is received by rail car and is distributed by truck.  There are two (2) 80,000-gallon storage tanks at the site holding approximately 336,000 pounds each of liquid propane.  In addition, there are ten (10) 30,000-gallon rail cars (maximum) at the site, holding approximately 126,000 pounds of liquid propane each.  There are both manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site.\n\nC.  The off-site consequence analysis considers a worst-case scenario and an alternate scenario involving a propane release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The RMP Rule states that the explosion endpoint is 1psi overpressure.\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of one of the 80,000-gallon storage tanks holding approximately 336,000 pounds of liquid propane.  It assumes all of the propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation system is considered.  The explosion endpoint was identified as 0.6 miles (per RMP Comp Ver. 1.07).  A search of public receptors within this radius identified commercial and residential properties.  Texon has multiple safeguards in place, which make this scenario very unlikely, including an aggressive maintenance and inspection program.\n\nThe alternative scenario involves a propane release from a Multi-port 2.5-inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active"

      "SummaryText": "mitigation system considered in this scenario.  A total of 4,315 pounds of propane is ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum 1psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles.  A search of public receptors within this radius identified commercial and residential properties.\n\nD.  The Lordstown terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This propane transfer system was designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Texon, L.P.) instructions.\n\nE.  To date, this facility has never had an incident involving propane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place."
