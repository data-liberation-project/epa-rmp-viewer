In service to the\ncommunity, Acme has a history of proactive approach to prevention and emergency response for\naccidental release of toxic substances.  Current prevention and emergency response polices\nadhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency\nResponse requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\n     The Acme water treatment plant located at 1100 Wellington Trace in Wellington, Florida\nutilizes chlorine gas in the water treatment process to disinfect potable drinking water supplied\nto the village.  The water treatment plant contains a chlorination area and chlorination\ndistribution system on-site.  Chlorine is delivered and stored on-site in cylinders containing\n2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure when full.  Typically at any given time of day,\nthree (3) cylinders are full and awaiting rotation into service, two (2) cylinders are \"on-line\" and\none (1) cylinder is connected into the system as backup.\n\n     Acme has an outstanding performance history in conjunction with handling, storing,\nmaintaining and operating of chlorine gas and the chlorine disinfection system.  No accidental\nreleases have occurred since the system went into service in 1973.  The water treatment plant is\nmanned 24 hours/day, seven (7) day/week and 365 days/year.  State certified operational\npersonnel are trained in safe handling, maintenance and operation of the chlorine disinfection\nsystem that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The chlorination system is designed\nutilizing latest technologies and industry specific design codes and standards. This state-of-the-\nart approach at Acme makes the system inherently safer than"

The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the\ncommunity emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee\n(LEPC).  Operational staff are trained according to these response plans.\n\n     The EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios\nfor toxic substances identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case\nrelease\" is defined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in\nthe largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA\nspecifies the parameters to use in calculation of the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve\n\"toxic endpoint.\"  The alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case\nrelease scenario.\"  EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis was performed to determine the distance\ntraveled by the chlorine released before it's concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\"\nselected by EPA as 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2  \n(ERPG - 2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the\n\"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be\nexposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious\nhealth effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\n\n     Utilizing the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document for Acme, a \ndistance calculated to toxic endpoint is 3.5 miles for the worst case release and a 0.30 mile for\nthe alternative release.  As per EPA regulations, the population is estimated within the circles\ndefined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic endpoints.  These population values are 44,343\nfor the worst case and 495 for the alternative release, respectively.  It is noted that if an actual"

The Acme Improvement\nDistrict, like virtually every modern water treatment facility, understands the value and risks of\nthis treatment procedure.  The Acme Improvement District has an exceptional track record of no\naccidental releases in its history and remains ever vigilant in its attention to safety regarding\nchlorine.  Acme Improvement District supports this regulatory effort to inform the public in the\ngeneral vicinity of any utility of the risks associated with accidental gaseous releases.  Indeed,\nwe support efforts to notify the public of such risks at all points of exposure including the\nproduction, delivery and site storage of chlorine gas.\n\n     If you have questions on this matter, you may contact the Acme Improvement District at\n14000 Greenbriar Blvd., Wellington, FL 33414, (561)791-4000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndwm/execsum/98-101"
