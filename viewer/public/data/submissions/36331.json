      "SummaryText": "The Ravenna Foundry is a division of Ravenna Aluminum Inc. which manufactures aluminum castings for the automotive industry. The types of automobile parts produces by the Ravenna foundry includes, but is not limited to the following, air intake manifolds, oil filter adapters, deactivator housings, etc. Parts that are cast are used on the engines of many cars including, but not limited to the following; Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler Minivans, and Ford Explorer's.\nThe Ravenna Foundry utilizes the semi-permanent mold process to produce it's castings. The semi-permanent mold process derives its name from the fact that the mold is more or less \"permanent\" but the sand core are temporary, they can only be used one time. Sand cores are used to form internal passages in the part and are made up of sand and resins that are used to bind the sand together. The process of making the sand cores is called the \"coremaking\" process. Important equipment used in the coremaking process include a mixer, coremachine, and a corebox. The corebox is the mold that is used to form the cores. After sand and resins are blown into the cavity of the corebox, sulfur dioxide (a catalyst) is blown through the sand and resins which activates the \"curing process\". Curing is the process in which the sand/resin mix changes from a wet, mud-like substance into a solid form. The coremake process utilizes one (1) 2, 000 lb. cylinder or approximately 165 gallons of sulfur dioxide that moves through piping and into the corebox. Sulfur Dioxide enters into the corebox as a gas and exits through vacuum hoses into a scubber, which neutralizes the sulfur dioxide. \nThe Ravenna foundry's Risk Management Program describes release scenario's that could possibly happen in the event of an emergency. The EPA's RMP *Comp program was used as a guideance in conducting the modeling of the different scenario's that could happen in the event of an emergency. The Ravenna foundry has in place, an emergency alarm system that wou"

      "SummaryText": "ld alert trained personnel to a concentrated area of sulfur dioxide. This allows for an immediate investigation of a possible hazard. If a hazard is found, an emergency evacuation alarm is sounded which in-turn shuts down the sulfur dioxide system and alerts hazmat trained individuals of a potential discharge or release. In the event of a cylinder leak, specially trained haz-mat employees can apply a cylinder patch specifically designed for the cylinders to the leak. Fuse plugs are provided to allow a slow release of sulfur dioxide if the temperature of the cylinders is elevated above 165 degrees F. \nThe Ravenna foundry prevention program complies with the Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) PSM rule and a failure mode and effect analysis was used along with written procedures to comply with these rules and regulations. Trained personnel with a step-by-step check-off sheet closely scrutinize the hook up of the sulfur dioxide cylinder to the system. Space aged stainless steel fittings are utilized throughout the system to ensure leak free piping. Employee's have been trained to indentify potential problems and reportt the same to management personnel. We have had no accidental releases at the Ravenna foundry in the past five (5) years. \nThe Ravenna foundry's Emergency Response program descibes personnel responsible for the evacuation of the company and the coordination with the local emergency agencies to address leaks and spills of sulfur dioxide."
