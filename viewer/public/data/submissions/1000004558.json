Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Granger Gas Plant is located approximately 10 miles west of Little America, Wyoming.  The facility includes compression, dehydration, cryogenic liquid recovery, hydrocarbon fractionation and a refrigeration system.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and a liquid product containing ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier liquids.  Propane, iso-butane and butane are stored under pressure and shipped from the plant via truck.  The liquefied product containing ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons are not stored at the facility, but shipped via pipeline.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic.  There are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Granger Plant.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by the regulation.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n \nThe following is a summary of the a"
