Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care \u00ae.\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility has one process that produces  prepolymers which are used to make polyurethanes.  The regulated substance involved with this batch operation is toluene diisocyanate. \n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 71,260 pounds of toluene diisocyanate.   The mitigating effects of a dike, with tertiary liner, and an enclosure were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The cloud formed by the evaporating toluene diisocyanate would not reach off-site endpoints and nearby public and environmental receptors.  [Due to minimal allowable entries in the RMP Submit software, both release rate (section 2.6) and Distance to endpoint (section 2.11) are overstated.  The rate minimum is 1 lb/min, and the actual rate is 0.00559 lb/min.  The endpoint minimum is 0.2 miles, while our endpoint is 105 feet, or 0.0199 miles.]\n\nSince the worst-case scenario has no effect beyond our fenceline and there have been no releases that had off-site effects, the toluene diisocyanate process falls into program level 1.  The regulation does not require the identification of alternative release scenarios for program level 1 processes because they would not have off-site effects.\n\n(d) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEAS"

This plan is coordinated with local emergency response through the Cattaraugus County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Copies of the plan are provided to local fire and police departments, as well as privately contracted emergency responders.  \n\nThe plan defines individual responsibilities and tasks during various emergencies.   CYTEC OLEAN provides training appropriate to the level of involvement to all employees.\n\nDuring emergencies involving spills, CYTEC OLEAN employees are asked to report the event, provide key information on the type and extent of the emergency, and follow the Emergency Coordinator's instructions to stabilize processes, control employee access to affected in plant areas, and control immediate access to the facility by visitors, contractors and off-shift employees.  The Emergency Coordinator, or backups, direct this first response, and make timely notifications to local responders and the Emergency Response Contractor.  When local emergency responders arrive, the Emergency Coordinator provides on-site assistance and support.  Spill Response, including all clean-up and remedial operations, is the responsibility of the Emergency Response Contractor.  The Plan defines notifications to Local, State and Federal Agencies, as well as the Public.\n\n(g) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safe"
