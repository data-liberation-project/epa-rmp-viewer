It is the Town of South Boston's intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.\n\n1.0  POLICIES IN PLACE\n\nThe Town of South Boston Waste Water Treatment Facility complies with Clean Air Act and Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) air emissions regulations and has policies in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n2.0  SOURCE AND SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility is responsible for treating waste water for the Town of South Boston (SIC Code 4952, NAICS Code 22132). Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Services, CAS Number 7782-50-5) is used to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharging it into the Dan River. The Town of South Boston stores approximately four (4) 1-ton cylinders on site.  Sulfur Dioxide (CAS Number 7446-09-5) is used to reduce or eliminate the chlorine residual following the disinfection and prior to discharge into the Dan River.  The Town of South Boston stores approximately ten (10) 150-lb cylinders on site.  Since this is less than the threshold quantity of 5,000 lbs, Sulfur Dioxide is not considered a regulated substance at the Town of South Boston Waste Water Treatment Facility.  In the event that the Facility plans to store 5,000 lbs of Sulfur Dioxide, this RMP must be revised before such quantities are allowed to be stored at the facility.\n\n3.0  PURPOSE OF RMP SUBMISSION\n\nThe RMP was initially prepared and submitted in June 1999.  The purpose of this RMP submission is to comply with the 5-year re-submission requirement as imposed by the EPA.  New information that is required for this submission is also included in this RMP.\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility i"
