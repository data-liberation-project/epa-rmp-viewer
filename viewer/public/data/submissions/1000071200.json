If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared\n\nto work with the local fire department, County Emergency Management, the Iowa Department of Natural\n\nResources and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the\n\nenvironment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous\n\nammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\nThis facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 20 CFR\n\n1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous\n\nammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the last five years that have caused\n\nany deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any\n\naccidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental\n\ndamage.\n\nThe felicity has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38. We do not plan to\n\nhave our employees respond to a major release. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our\n\nfacility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency\n\nresponse numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the\n\nconditions of the facility. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or\n\nthe use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time.\n\n"
