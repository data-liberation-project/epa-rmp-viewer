To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil. High pressure gas from the well is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant (JT separator).  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by  transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in four bulk atmospheric storage tanks (400 barrels each) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The volume of NGL is estimated at 156,000 lbs and the volume of condensate is estimated at 369,600 lbs.\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss both"

This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
