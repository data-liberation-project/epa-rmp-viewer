      "SummaryText": "The Helena Wyaconda, MO Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Wyaconda, MO Facility located approximately 1.0 mile north of 11211 Jefferson Street, Wyaconda, MO 63474 off of State Highway A.  The physical address of the Facility is 11848 County Road 127, Wyaconda, MO 63474.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Wyaconda, MO Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Wyaconda, MO Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a correction to update the Facility and owner/operator physical addresses and nurse tank inventory.  The updated physical addresses for both the Facility and owner/operator reflects the update received from the 911 system.  It is important to note that the physical location of the Facility has not been moved from the original location.  Further, since the last update, the Facility has reduced its inventory of nurse tanks.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Wyaconda Facility operations Office is located at 11211 Jefferson Street, Wyaconda, MO 63474. However, the Wyaconda Retail Facility covered process is loca"

      "SummaryText": "ted approximately at 11848 County Road 127 - approximately 1.0 mile north of 11211 Jefferson Street, Wyaconda, MO 63474 off of State Highway A.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the covered process via a commercial tanker truck and then transferred to one (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (10) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and (5) 1,465-gallon nurse tanks. Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  Although Helena conducts blending operations using anhydrous ammonia, the quantity of anhydrous ammonia is below the RMP threshold of anhydrous ammonia and therefore is not subject to 40 CFR Part 68.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact fro"

      "SummaryText": "m a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow valves and emergency shutoff valves on the storage tank side of the bulkhead and excess flow valve and emergency shutoff valve on the commercial tanker truck) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility's Operation Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Operation Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Wyaconda, MO Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Wyaconda, MO Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Wyaconda, MO Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Wyaconda, MO Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Clark County LEPC and the Wyaconda Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program a"
