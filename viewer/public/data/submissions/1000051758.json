      "SummaryText": "A.  The East Rio Hondo Water Supply Corporation (ERHWSC) Accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The ERHWSC emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and to emergency response services available to the rural community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program  requirements.\r\n\r\n B.  The ERHWSC plant was installed to coagulate,settle,filter,and chlorinate water for use by its customers.  The facility is located at 26108 Nelson Road, San Benito, Texas. The Plant utilizes a chlorinating station, various safety equipment, an instrument room containing flow recorders, various electrical panels and additional safety equipment. The amount of chlorine on site is three one-ton containers and three (3) 150 lbs cylinders. Water treatment operators are at the facility 4 hours per day 7 days a week while ton cylinders are stored onsite and respond to any alarms that may occur, from remote monitoring locations.\r\n\r\n C. The off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as\" worst- case release\" and \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario follows EPA guidelines which states, \"The owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur\" than the worst-case release scenario.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine release before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA at .0087mg/L, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Ass"

The off-site consequence analysis for these scenarios was performed.  The pre-defined conditions set by EPA , namely the release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\r\n\r\nEPA - mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed 1.5 m/sec, air temperature (77F), and average humidity (50%) were used.\r\n\r\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario as performed using the EPA RMP*Comp, a distance to toxic endpoint of 2.2 miles and an estimate of residential population of 2788 was obtained.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the cylinder relief valve. The atmospheric dispersion modeling for the alternative release scenario, as performed using the EPA RMP*Comp, yields a dispersion radius of 0.3 miles. The amount of chlorine released is 2000 lbs. At an average rate over 40 minutes (the duration of the release) at 49.3 lbs/min to the toxic endpoint distance of the ERPG-2 Level.\r\n\r\nD.  The general ERHWSC accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n         - High level of training of the operators\r\n         - Preventive maintenance program\r\n         - Use of state-of-the-art proce"

No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nF.  The facility has emergency Response Plan that has been reviewed by the Rio Hondo Vol. Fire Department. This program includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluation will be conducted every two years; emergency operation and response procedures will be reviewed at that time.\r\n\r\nG. Changes to improve safety (recommended actions) will be reviewed upon completion of a facility Hazard Assessment and Compliance Audit on an annual basis."
