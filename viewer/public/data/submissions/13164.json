Resources used in the process was International Institute of Ammonia \nRefrigeration Guidelines, RMP Pro 98 Software by Dyadem\nand Cold Storage Technologies.\n\nReport organization includes; Certification statement, Summary, Detailed Elements and Map of  \nPotential Impact. \n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at HMC Cold Storage are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  \nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program \nthat covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee \ntraining associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate \ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u0012s primary activities encompass Packing and storage of fresh produce.  We have 1 \nregulated substance present at our facility above threshold quantities.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is \nused for Refrigeration.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia \nRefrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have \nemployed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs \nprovide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  In this scenario 11000 lb. of \nAmmonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm de"

The released quantity has been limited to 45% of the maximum capacity of the source \nby physical limitations of available High Pressure Receiver capacity and a system of \nadministrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum \ndistance of 2.18 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Population \nfrom census information within this radius is 4162, however the Plume Footprint would be \napproximately 10% of this number. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia \nRefrigeration.  The scenario involves the release of 300.00 lb. of vapor from a compressor seal \nfailure.  The release is stopped by manually isolating the compressor after 60 minutes.  Under \nneutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of \nAmmonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles. This reaches the facility boundry and has a population of 1.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections \nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHMC Cold Storage maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical \nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes \nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \nWhat If/Checklist (combined).  T"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most \nrecent PHA/update was performed on 06/18/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, HMC Cold \nStorage maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of \noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is \nregularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHMC Cold Storage has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who \nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these \nprocesses.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHMC Cold Storage carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to \nensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; \npressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown \nsystems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel \nwith previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered \nspecialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance \nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at HMC Cold Storage to manage changes in process chemicals, \ntechnology, equipment and procedures.

The most recent review was \nperformed on 03/08/1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, \noperating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment \ninto operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHMC Cold Storage conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set \nout under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted \non 06/18/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions \nrequired as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHMC Cold Storage promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably \nresult in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to \nidentify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the \nrelease from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHMC Cold Storage truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a \nteam effort.
