City of Industry (Walnut, CA) facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under 29 CFR 1910.119, OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Applicable California regulations include the California Health and Safety Code, Article 2 and 8 CCR 5189 Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Libbey?s employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nLibbey?s management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Libbey Inc. City of Industry facility located in Walnut, California combines raw materials to produce glass tableware.  The raw materials used in the process include various dry ingredients that are melted in a furnace and then pressed or blown into various shapes of ware.  Support operations include a propane gas system, limited quantities of hydrogen and acetylene and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical, propane, is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP) and 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM).  Propane is used to back up the natural gas fuel to the furnace and to supply propane fueled forklifts.  The propane system is leased and operated by a third party, United Pacific Energy (UPE) as a distribution outlet for sales to wholesalers and retailers.  UPE utilizes a subcontractor, currently United Bottle Gas (U"

One (1) smaller 1,150 gallon propane storage tank is also located in another area of the facility.  The smaller tank (currently operated by Mutual Propane) is used to fill forklifts at the facility.\n\nIn addition, one (1) 4,500 gallon tank of hydrogen is located at the facility for process use and portable acetylene tanks used for torch cutting are stores in a rack or distributed as needed within the facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Libbey facility is governed by a set of OSHA, USEPA and California regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure\n40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\nCA Health and Safety Code, Article 2\n8 CCR 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials\n\nThe key concepts in Libbey?s release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, use of qualified outside contractors for propane process system operation, maintenance and emergency response and appropriate training of employees.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Libbey management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the propane system.  Libbey employees are not trained or expected to be members of the facility emergency response team for propane.\n\nLibbey policy is to construct all new equipment, systems and"

      "SummaryText": " facilities in accordance with applicable building and safety codes.  This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.\n\nLibbey is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their orientation for the facility.  Libbey also conducts annual safety training for all employees.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for systems that they are responsible for.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nLibbey has not had a significant release of propane from this facility that has affected the public or the environment.  Two minor incidents that activated facility emergency response and incident investigations have occurred within the last five years.  In September 2000 during a transport truck unloading a rail compressor vent opened, resulting in a one second ignition of a release.  In March 2003 an operator left a hose valve partially open after filling a truck resulting in a brief visible release of vapor.  In both cases the incidents were brief and the system emergency shutoff systems operated properly to minimize the releases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nLibbey has contracted personnel trained in emergency response available to the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  These personnel receive semiannual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.  In addition, the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) will respond to an offsite emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to Improve Safety\n\nLibbey Inc. completes a thorough review of the propane system each time a design change is implemented.  The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised.  Libbey is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
