Our employees are trained to inspect, maintain and operate our equipment to prevent a release of hazardous material.  We have developed and implemented an Emergency Response Plan with a goal to minimize hazards to all employees, visitor and persons in the vicinity.\n\n\n\nPoultry-processing requires significant refrigeration which is accomplished via the use of anhydrous ammonia at Allen Harim's Cordova Plant. \n\n\n\nThis plant has a RMP Program 3 status for the operation of its ammonia refrigeration system used for cooling.  The Program 3 requires preparation of a worse case release scenario for the toxic material stored at this site.  The worst case would be the release of a 15,391.4-pound storage tank of ammonia.  The toxic endpoint would be 1.5 miles downwind.\n\n \n\nThe alternative case for an ammonia release is a 5-pound/minute (lb./min) release for 75 minutes which developed as a pinhole leak at a weld. between the shell and tube in the icemaker .  Personnel knowledgeable of the site-specific refrigeration equipment and the process developed this scenario.  RMP comp was used to calculate the end point based on the estimated time to discover the leak, to isolate the system and move the ammonia to another vessel. The estimated distance to toxic end point for this release is < 0.1 miles.  Operators are trained to use self-contained breathing apparatus to respond to ammonia release. \n\n\n\nAllen Harim has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program which is designed to prevent or minimize the c"

We maintain up to date piping and instrument drawings, Material Safety Data Sheets, and we have a written preventive maintenance program.  We use a computerized database program to produce work orders for regular preventative maintenance, yearly inspections and to maintain a history of the refrigeration equipment.  We use the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) inspection checklist for our yearly inspections.  If any problems are identified, corrective action will be documented on the work order.  Upon completion of the work order, entry into the database will provide a permanent record.  We have developed and updated our PSM manual with extensive employee participation.  We also use the database as a means to scheduled quarterly reviews with the PSM team to ensure that our PSM manual stays \"a living document\".  The PSM manual includes our operating procedures, which are updated as needed and reviewed each year.  Our operators are provided training relative to their respective duties.  They receive both on the job training and outside instruction, all training is documented.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study was conducted to identify and evaluate potential hazards.  The studies are updated every 5 years or when needed due to a change in the process.  Allens evaluates their PSM program by conducting compliance audits every three years using checklists developed by OSHA.  \n\n\n\nDuring the last 5 years, there have been no reportable injuries associated with this process.\n\n\n\nAll Allen Harim employees receive hazard communications training during orientation, which includes evacuation procedures, emergency release notification and alarm signal recognition.
