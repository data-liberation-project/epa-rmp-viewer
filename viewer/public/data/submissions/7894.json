The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nNORTHEAST COOP  complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the THE DIXON COUNTY SHERIFF IN COORDINATION WITH THE WAKEFIELD VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPT and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed  for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tank is _92700_____ pounds. (Optional)\n\n3.  The Worst-case release scenario.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.

The boiling point at atmospheric pressure is -28 degrees F.  Above 900 degrees F, ammonia begins to decompose, reverting to hydrogen and nitrogen.  At -107.9 degrees F., anhydrous ammonia freezes to form white crystals.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a relatively stable compound and is extremely hard to ignite.  Ammonia gas is flammable in air in the range of 16%-25% by volume with an ignition temperature of 1562 degrees F.  Conditions favorable for ignition are seldom encountered during normal operations due to the high lower limit, narrow range, and the high ignition temperature required.  However, the release of ammonia gas into a tightly enclosed or inadequately ventilated space may result in the accumulation of a flammable mixture that can cause a combustion explosion if a high temperature ignition source is present.\n(4)  Equipment Specifications\n\nNORTHEAST COOP will strive to keep on record all equipment specifications for bulk storage tanks, piping, pressure relief valves, temperature, pressure, and level gauges, valves, pumps, compressors, and hoses.\n(5)  Codes and Standards used to design, build, and operate our facilities.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nProcess Safety Information for Anhydrous Ammonia Storage    \nMSDS for Anhydrous Ammonia    Dated:\nMaximum Intended Inventory    22100\nNominal Water Capacity of Largest Tank    26000\nTemperature    Upper:  ambient max. 110 F\nLower:  ambient min. -15 F\nPressure    Upper:  240 PSI @ 110 F\nLower:  35 PSI @ -15 F\nFlow Rate    Loading:  120 G.P.M.\nUnloading:  41 G.P.M.\nVapor Piping    250 PSIG?

Confirmed all bleeder valves are closed.\n9. Vapor and liquid hoses are connected, making certain that all connections are straight and tight.\n10. Pressure in both the delivery tanker and storage vessel are checked.  Pressure in both tanks should be approximately equal at this point.

If the tank does not have at least several inches in it, very slowly open the liquid belly valve on the tank last, turning no more than two turns, until the liquid in the bulk tank is at least 5\" or 6\" deep.  This prevents possible damage to the bulk tank float on the sight gauge.  The PTO shaft should not be engaged until the valve is complete open.\n14. Once the transfer starts, it is against the law to leave the area.\n15. Fill the tank only 85% full,  Use the fixed liquid level gauge, which is also called the \"85% bleeder.\"\n16. When the transport tank is empty, compressor stopped and all vapor and liquid valves are closed, it is important to open the bleeder valves on the transport vapor and liquid hoses to make sure all pressure is out of each hose.\n17. Pressure from the lines should be released through bleeder valves into a 30 gallon drum of water.After pressure is relieved, bleeder valves are left open and hoses disconnected.  Always point hoses away from you and others in the area because ammonia could be trapped in the hose.  Leave bleeder valves are opened until the hoses are disconnected then close them.\n18. After all hoses and adapters are stowed ensure all acme caps are replaced, locks replaced on bulk tank lines.  A final check is made to assure that all valves are closed and hoses disconnected before approval is given to remove chocks and move tanker truck.\n19. Finally, when it is safe, goggles and gloves are removed.  Personnel protective equipment is to be cleaned{as necessary}and only then properly stored.\nAMMONIA TRANSFER TO NURSE TANK\nThe following is the typical step-by-step procedures for ammonia transfer.\n1. Before beginning the transfer, the coop employee checks the condition of all required safety equipment.  All equipment must be in good condition before proceeding.

Then connect the riser liquid hose to the nurse tank liquid fill valve.\n6. Slowly open the vapor valves starting at the nurse tank and proceeding along the line through the compressor (if used) to the bulk tank vapor valve, opening each valve as you come to it.\n7. Compare nurse tank pressure with bulk tank pressure.  They should now be equalized.\n8. Open liquid valves, starting at the bulk tank and proceed along the line through the pump (if used) to the tank liquid fill valve.\n9. Start pump/compressor (if used) and make sure the flow starts.  If the flow does not start, recheck all previous steps..\n10. During transfer the law requires you to stay in attendance.  Use this time to check:  safety water on nurse tanks; cover on pressure relief valve; tires on nurse tank; safety chain, hitch pin and tongue and wheel bearings.\n11. When the nurse tank float gauge shows 75% full, open the 85% bleeder valve, making sure the opening faces away from you.  The valve should be releasing vapor at this point.  Watch for the change to a stream of liquid that indicates the nurse tank is at the 85% safe fill level.\n12. If using a compressor:  close the riser liquid valve, then the 85% bleeder and then stop compressor.  If using a liquid pump:  stop the pump, then close the riser liquid valve, and then close the 85% bleeder valve.\n13. Close the hose-end valve on the liquid line, to allow liquid to drain from the coupling.\n14. Close all liquid valves, then all vapor valves.\n15.
