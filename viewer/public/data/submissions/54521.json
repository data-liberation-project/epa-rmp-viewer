This water treatment plant (4.28 MGD) is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Cayey Wastewater Treatment Plant is observing the appropriated engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\nCayey-Cidra Wastewater Treatment Plant is located close to the Rio La Plata where the plant discharges the treated water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans and contamination of the Rio La Plata.\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Cayey-Cidra Wastewater Treatment Plant could have a storage maximum volume of 12,000 pounds distributed in six (6) containers.  Two containers are connected to chlorinators one is in use (80 pounds per day) the chlorine flows to the vacuum chlorinator and from it the chlorine is sent to the contact chamber, through a underground pipeline, where it is combined with the used water at the end of plant?"

      "SummaryText": "s process. \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2000, it was identified that 10,740 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a 3/8 inch pipe leak.  In such case the end point distance is calculated as 0.1 miles and no public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOP?s) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP?s are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nPRASA has various SOP?s to manage eme"

It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to containers handling and transportation, preventive maintenance and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated April 22, 2009."
