This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use chlorine in ton containers.  The policy at this facility is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, the policy is to notify the City of Ottawa Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nFacility and regulated substance   \r\nThis facility is a water treatment plant located in Ottawa, Kansas.  It employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: pretreatment, aeration, softening, stabilization, filtration, and disinfection  processes.  The covered process includes the use of chlorine chemicals.  This chemical is used in the disinfection and chlorination process that is used to destroy pathogenic microorganisms.  The major plant process unit involved in disinfection is the chlorination system.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is provided through truck-delivered one-ton containers and the maximum intended inventory is 4,000 pounds.  Chlorine is drawn from the containers in gaseous form and fed through chlorinators into the water streams.\r\n\r\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the largest chlorine-containing vessel in the system, the ton container.  It can contain up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The rule for worst-case release analysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a methodical analysis of accident history, hazard review, experience at other similar company facilities, and industry experience.  The result is that a failure of one of the fusible plugs due to a dropping accident during unloading was chosen as the scenario.  The assumed leak occurs outside of any containment and chlorine gas flows t"

Because the release would be directly to atmosphere, no enclosure factors were considered.  No other mitigative measures were considered.\r\n\r\nFor both analyses, the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used.  The results were verified using RMP*Comp, which is based on the formulae in the guidance document.  The distance to the endpoint for the chlorine worst-case release is 1.3 miles and for the alternative release, the distance is 0.1 mile.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention program\r\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 2 processes.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state and local laws.  To achieve and maintain this compliance, the City has in place procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves,containment vessels and industry standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine, or at least minimize the effects of a release.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history\r\nThis facility has not had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nEmergency response program  \r\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan that is coordinated with local emergency responders.  The Ottawa Fire Department is the primary responder.  City employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan includes causes and effects of emergen"
