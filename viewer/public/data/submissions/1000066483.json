The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Costco Wholesale's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Laredo Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale is located at 8510 El Gato Road, in Laredo, Texas.  The facility is approximately 0.71 miles west of Interstate 35 and approximately 0.73 miles north of State Loop 20.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of industrial and light commercial and residential areas west of the facility.\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale began facility operations in November 2002.  The facility uses approximately 14,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, "

The majority of the equipment is located inside the Engine Room.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective high, medium and low areas and Engine Room areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale's ammonia refrigeration system at the Laredo facility has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\n\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and the warehouse.  The ammonia sensors will activate the audible and visual alarms, send an alarm to the computer system, and send a signal to the auto-dialer which calls facility personnel on the contact list at the low level alarm.  At the high level alarm, the ammonia detector shuts down all electrical power in the Engine Room, close the solenoid valves, and activate the ventilation fan. In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.). \n\n\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves, via an emergency refrigerant control box, to an outside underground"

This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation conducted on August 14, 2012, and again on June 6-9, 2017, revealed that there have been no ammonia releases over the past five years (June 2012 - June 2017) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale - Laredo facility has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  The facility is non-responding.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Laredo Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to al"

If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Sensor will be called.\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.

This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to renovation of the facility.\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees and will coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation was conducted on October 14, 2012, and again on June 6 - 9, 2017 to satisfy the five year update requirements.  The PHA Revalidation team involved in the development of the HAZOP made several procedural/managerial recommendations which include updating the piping diagram, valve tags, signage, and maintenance test/inspection to improve safety at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP and safety programs.\n\n\n\n2.
