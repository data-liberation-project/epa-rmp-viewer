When Cessco relocated its plant \r\nfacilities in 1991, it sought an isolated location.  In determining the propellant tank location sites, \r\nthe tanks were placed at the furthest possible distance from homes or offices.  Being a small, \r\nclose knit company, management makes every effort to provide a safe working environment.  \r\nMonthly safety meetings are held and management and plant personnel interact equally.  Every \r\nemployee has received and been certified in Hazardous Materials HM0181F/126F Training.  \r\nLast training and certification was completed on October 29, 2012, on site by trainer William C. Davis.  \r\nCessco also receives regular courtesy visits from the St. Johns Fire Department as the \r\nfire department periodically uses Cessco's plant and grounds for the training of their new \r\nfiremen.\r\n\r\nCessco manufactures insecticide aerosols, insecticide liquids, and liquid cleaning products.  \r\nCessco formulates and fills its own EPA registered products and also contract fills for other \r\ncompanies.  All products are formulated from EPA approved Confidential Statements of \r\nFormula. The concentrated active ingredients used in various formulas are pyrethrum, piperonyl \r\nbutoxide, permethrin, tetamethrin.  These \r\nactive ingredients are blended with solvents, those being Isopar M, LPA 170, BVA KX45, \r\nand Odorless Mineral Spirits.  Propellants used to fill \r\nthe aerosols are HFC-134A (non-flammable) and Hydrocarbon AB-85 (flammable).  All of the \r\nchemicals except for 134A and AB-85 are brought into the plant in 5, 30, or 55 gallon containers.  \r\n134-A and AB-85 are received in bulk and put into storage tanks located on the northeast side of \r\nthe plant property.\r\n\r\nCessco currently complies with the rules and regulations set forth by the EPA, DOT, OSHA, \r\nDEHEC, and local agencies.

      "SummaryText": "ention Program focuses on repeatedly \r\ntraining employees, (e.q. daily hands on training.)  Before any start up of equipment, it is \r\nrequired that all pumps, compressors, pressure gauges and pressure relief valves be inspected.\r\nBack-up and prevention systems are as follows:\r\n    \r\n1) Emergency shut-off systems for electrical, piping, and pumps. \r\n2) Backflow prevention valves.\r\n3) Excess flow valves.\r\n4) Pressure relief valves.\r\n5) Breakaway piping.\r\n6) 20 PSI blow out panels.\r\n7) Sprinkler systems.\r\n\r\nCessco has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nCessco's Emergency Response Plan is coordinated directly with the St. Johns Fire Department \r\nand HAZMAT Response Team.  The nearest fire department is 2.5 miles away and response \r\ntime is five (5) minutes or less.\r\n\r\nCessco will continue hands on training of its personnel and monthly safety meetings.  There are \r\nno changes planned for the emergency shut down and prevention systems that are in now in \r\nplace.  Our biggest challenge is keeping up to date on the many rule changes that take place with \r\nthe various government agencies.  Plans are in process to contract with a consultant in \r\nOccupational and Environmental Health and Safety to assure that the company stays up-to-date \r\nand in compliance with the rules and regulations of EPA, DOT, OSHA, DEHEC, and local \r\nagencies."
