      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNCFI Polyurethanes is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in Mt. Airy, North Carolina.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the following regulated chemicals are present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified by EPA regulations: toluene diisocyanate (TDI -10,000 pounds) and a pentane mixture (10,000 pounds).  The facility has two covered processes and meets the Program 1 requirements for TDI and Program 3 requirements for the pentane mixture of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations  \n\nTDI\n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars, truck, drums and totes and is offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n\nPentane Mixture\n\nNCFI Polyurethanes uses two (2) different chemical components in the blending production of hydrocarbon based foam raw materials.  Polyol and a hydrocarbon blowing agent (the pentane mixture) are blended onsite to create the Poly Blend.    Three (3) different raw material polyols are transferred from the 3,000 gallon storage tanks located within the Pentane Operations Room into the adjacent Max Machinery Blending Unit to formulate the Polyol Blend.  \n\n \n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies \n\nNCFI Polyurethanes is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of TDI are documented in the Section 7 of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with commu"

Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations each owner or operator of a stationary source is required to perform the following offsite consequence analyses.\n\n??    One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated toxic and flammable substances held in excess of the threshold quantity.  A worst-case release scenario were conducted for TDI and the pentane mixture.\n\n??    One alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance held in excess of the threshold quantity.  An alternative release scenario was not required for TDI. An alternative release scenario was calculated for the pentane mixture.\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the release scenarios that are being submitted by NCFI Polyurethanes.   \n\nNCFI Polyurethanes elected to use ALOHA to calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the TDI endpoint. NCFI Polyurethanes evaluated one worst-case release scenarios for TDI for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan). Since TDI is covered under Program 1, an alternative release scenario is not required.\n\nNCFI Polyurethanes elected to use EPA's CAMEO Software to calculate the release rate and distance to the endpoint for the flammable pentane mixture. NCFI Polyurethanes evaluated one worst-case release scenario and two alternative case release scenarios for the pentane mixture for inclusion on the RMPlan.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nTDI\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario for NCFI Polyurethanes was determined to be an instantaneous liquid spill and vaporization of TDI from the largest vessel into a diked area.  A major release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely due to the advances that have taken place in the process design as well as the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs present at the NCFI Polyurethanes facility.

A release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely due to the design and rigorous maintenance and prevention program present at the NCFI Polyurethanes facility.
