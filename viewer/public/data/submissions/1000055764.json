Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs\n\nthat ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Indianapolis facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety   systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n\n- P"

For example, the facility employs plant emergency trip stations so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Toledo facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Toledo location will be a \"non-responding facility\" as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\n\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
