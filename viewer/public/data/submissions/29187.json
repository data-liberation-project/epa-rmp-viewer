      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Pierre Foods, Inc. to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community and the environment.  The Company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Pierre Foods has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The Company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPierre Foods, Inc. processes portion controlled frozen meats and poultry products.  Raw meats are brought into the facility, portioned, cooked and frozen. To prevent contamination with harmful bacteria and to freeze the final product, ammonia is used.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nPierre Foods, Inc. has developed models of the releases at this facility and the potential affected areas.  A commercial computer model, PhastProfessional, was used to develop the models.\n\nThe worst-case release of ammonia involves the sudden failure of a Recirculator when used as a storage vessel which has the capacity to hold 30,000 pounds of ammonia.  Depending on wind direction, residences, schools, hospitals and businesses at a distance of 2.44 miles could be affect"

      "SummaryText": "ed.  Approximately 23,000 people live within a 2.44 mile radius of the facility.  This type release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and annual inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe alternative release of ammonia involves the a relief valve on a condenser lifting and failing to reset releaing 1,600 pounds of ammonia.  Residences up to .23 mile from the release would be affected.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nPierre Foods, Inc. has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level awareness when working with hazardous materials.\n\nAs part of the Prevention Program, Pierre Foods has developed a method to evaluate the Risk Management Program.  This method includes periodic evaluation of the Program utilizing a Process Hazard Analysis, and Compliance Audits.  The Process Hazard Analysis has identified deficiencies in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) currently in use at the facility.  Plans are in place for an outside consultant to assist in the upgrading of the refrigeration SOP.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nPierre Foods, Inc. has not had an accidental release as defined in 40 CFR 68.42(a) during the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e. fire, police, rescue, etc.)  Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams and annually with outside organizations.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS"
