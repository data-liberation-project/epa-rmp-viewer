Anitox has not experienced any accidents in the last five years or since the last revision of the Risk Management Plan. \n\nIn preparation for an emergency, Anitox insures that all public service agencies responsible for emergency response are kept informed and updated on the Anitox emergency response plan.  These agencies include, but are not limited to, the Russellville Fire Department, the Dover Fire Department and the Pope County Emergency Services.
