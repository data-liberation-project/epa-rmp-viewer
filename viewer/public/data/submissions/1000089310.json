It is Marinovich Cooling and Storage LLC.A\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Marinovich's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\r\n\r\nMarinovich Cooling and Storage LLC. emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action/response plan has been prepared for Marinovich Cooling and Storage LLC. and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\r\n\r\nMarinovich Cooling and Storage LLC. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with Process Safety Management (PSM) and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, Marinovich Cooling and Storage LLC. audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\nMarinovich Cooling and Storage LLC. owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 303A Salinas Road in Royal Oaks, California.  There are two refrigeration systems currently at the facility, the original (or main) refrigeration system (Process 1) and a second system based in engine room #2.  The original refrigeration system was installed in 1946.  The second refrigeration system (Process 2) (based in engine room #2) was installed in 1970.  Both refrigeration systems have been upgraded and modernized several times over the years. Process 2 was pumped down, vacated, isolated and not in operation sin"

      "SummaryText": "ce June of 2019.\r\n\r\nIn both of the refrigeration systems at Marinovich Cooling and Storage LLC., anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for the cold storage facilities.  Although the systems can operate independently, it is possible to shut down engine room #2. Which has benn done. Currently Marinovich operates the cold storage rooms serviced by engine room #2 from the main refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nDuring normal operation, anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, portions of the refrigeration system can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the control pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the control pressure receiver in the original (main) refrigeration system at a safe level of 80% by volume is 4,881 pounds\r\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Marinovich Cooling and Storage LLC. to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nWritten process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\r\nAn initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\r\nWritten operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\r\nSafe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\r\nEac"
