      "SummaryText": "The Oak Creek Power Plant, a coal-fired electric generating facility, constructed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) air pollution control system to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. The SCR utilizes aqueous ammonia which is injected into the exiting flue gas (exhaust gas) from the boiler system. The ammonia reacts with the nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor. The SCR requires ammonia to operate in an amount exceeding the threshold value specified in U.S. EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. Releases from the ammonia storage tanks (which are diked) and associated piping were evaluated as required by the RMP regulations. The diked storage tanks would minimize the pooled surface area created by a release, thereby reducing the amount of ammonia that could be released into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA worst-case release of aqueous ammonia from a single storage tank and associated piping within the diked containment area would result in a distance to toxic endpoint concentration of 1.5 miles, which was estimated using the ALOHA (Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) Air Dispersion Modeling Software program developed by U.S. EPA and NOAA. An alternative-case release scenario involves the rupture or uncoupling of a tanker truck transfer hose during delivery and results in a distance to toxic endpoint concentration of 0.22 miles, which was also estimated using the ALOHA model. Administrative controls, such as loading and tank filling procedures, are in place to limit the quantity of ammonia that could be released. The facility has not experienced any incidents with this substance as stated in response to U.S. EPA's 5-year accident history requirements.\r\n\r\nThe facility's prevention and emergency response plan includes the implementation of U.S. EPA's RMP regulations, OSHA safety programs, and emergency response procedures developed specifically for the facility by the company and the Local Emergency Planning Committ"
