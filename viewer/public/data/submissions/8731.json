The PSM Program is a comprehensive and detailed toxic chemical management program that is available for inspection at the Coneross Plant. The program includes the following accidental release prevention elements:\n\n/ High level and continuous training of the operators\n \n/ Preventive maintenance program\n\n/ The use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n\n/ The use of state of the art process and safety equipment.\n\n/ Performance of a hazard assessment of equipment and procedures\n\n/ Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\n\n/ Continuous review of process information including study of Material Safety Data Sheets which includes\n    information on the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine \n\n/ Chemical-specific steps include the availability of full-face respirators worn by the operators during tank change outs and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for alarm response.\n\n/ Chlorine detectors at the storage area.\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES\n\nNo acci"

This includes the following conditions: rate of release rounded to 110 lb. per minute, urban conditions, F stability, 1.5 meters per second wind speed, 0.0087 toxic endpoint. . When using these EPA assumptions, the distance to a toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.\nWhen the EPA RMP*COMP V1.06 for worst case scenario is used to obtain the distance endpoint of 0.9 miles, an area of concern can be determined in order to obtain an estimate of the population affected. In addition, other public receptors can be identified including schools, businesses, industries, and recreational facilities. The receptors identified for the worst case scenario at the Coneross Creek Treatment Facility are as follows: population affected 88; schools 0; business and industry 0; parks and recreation 0; environmental 0.\n\n \nATERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Coneross Waste Treatment Plant involves the misalignment of the vacuum regulator valve that is connected to a ton cylinder. This connection requires the use of a lead or composite washer. Misalignment of the washer or improper torsion of the valve fitting could/would cause a leak. The leak would occur on the tank side of the vacuum regulator causing a pressure leak approximately equal to the tank pressure. This scenario would allow chlorine gas to escape through a 3/8 inch (or smaller) opening resulting in the release of 87 lbs. of chlorine over a 10-minute release period (8.70 lb/min). The calculation for the release rate is taken from the EPA reference guide, section 8.1 and is as follows: QR (release rate) = HA (hole area in square inches) x PT (tank pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) x 1/square root of Tt (tank temperture-kelvin) x GS (gas factor).\n\nBased on EPA RMP*COMP V1.06, which assumes a 10 minute release, urban conditions, D stability, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, toxic endpoint for chlorine of 0"

This complies with all the applicable requirements of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP). The OCSC Rick Management Program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility.\n\nThe Coneross Waste Treatment Plant is a facility owned by the OCSC that exceeds the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119) threshold limit of 1500 pounds of Chlorine (CAS:007782-50-5). These facilities are manned and are required by 1910.119 to establish a PSM program. The OCSC has implemented a PSM program that is unique to this facility. Presently, the facility exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 pounds of chlorine established by CAA 112r, therefore, the facility has implemented a Risk Management Program based on CAA 112r Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe facility uses many technological and managerial practices that are not unique, in fact are common in the water-wastewater treatment industry. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the facility in ton cylinders and placed in a tank storage area. Gaseous Chlorine, collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperature, is piped off by a vacuum chlorinating system and injected into  plant utility water to form a solution of hypochlorite. The solution is piped to contact chambers for the purpose of disinfecting wastewater. The equipment at this facility includes a tank storage area, chlorinator room that contains the chlorinators, feed indicators, various safety equipment, and electrical panels.

      "SummaryText": "are included in the OCSC PSM for the facility.\n \nThe offsite consequence analysis, required by CAA, includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling based on EPA RMP*COMP V1.06 was performed for the facility. This program was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA of 3 PPM, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELESE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst release scenario for the facility involves a failure of a one ton cylinder (a total of 2000 lb. of chlorine). The conditions for the worst case scenario are pre-defined by EPA (release of the entire amount of gas in 10 minutes). The rate of release is equal to the amount in the cylinder divided by the time of the release or 2000 lb. / 10 minutes = 200 lbs. per minute. Since the facilities have containment walls, the release rate can be diminished by using the EPA passive mitigation factor of 0.55 or .55 x 200 = 110 lbs. per minute. EPA RMP*COMP V1.06 was use"
