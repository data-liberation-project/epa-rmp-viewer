Maintaining Safe Operations / Auditing Operations:\n\n-    Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are inspected on a regular basis.\n\n-    Numerous mechanical integrity and preventative maintenance programs are in place to ensure that equipment is in sound working condition. These include an extensive piping and equipment corrosion and vibration inspection and correction program.\n\n-    Both internal and corporate audits are conducted on a regular schedule to help ensure compliance with company safety procedures and regulations.\n\n-    OSHA is invited into the Texas Operations facility periodically to conduct VPP inspections to continue Texas Operations designation as an OSHA VPP Star Site.\n\nTraining:\n\n-    Operators are initially trained on the specifics of the process they will be running. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\n-    Maintenance Mechanics personnel receive on-the-job skills training under the supervision of Flint Hills Resources and is documented by their supervisor.\n\n-    Contract employees are required to have OSHA mandated training prior to performing work at Texas Operations. In addition, Texas Eastman Operations provides a site-specific contractor Safety and Health orientation for all contractors employed at the work site.\n\nIn addition to the above elements, Texas Operations is an OSHA Volunteer Star site in the federal OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). VPP is a cooperative program between employers and OSHA to improve worker safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and programs. Texas Operations is one of fewer than 400 sites nationwide to qualify for Star status. To maintain Star status, Texas Operations must meet specific safety performance measures and pass an OSHA VPP inspection every few years.\n\n The dates of most recent activities reflected in this plan submission are the most recent\n\n occurrence as of May 10, 2021.\n\n",
