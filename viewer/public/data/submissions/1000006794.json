The regulated substances handled by this facility are Hydrogen Chloride, Trichlorosilane and Hydrogen, which are considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\nSEH America manufactures high quality silicon wafers used in the manufacture of integrated circuits.   This facility manufactures a number of different types and sizes of wafers.\n\nHydrogen Chloride and Trichlorosilane are used in the manufacturing of epitaxial wafers.  The epitaxial process produces a thin layer of silicon on top of already polished wafers.  Hydrogen chloride is a gas that is used in the deposition of this silicon layer.  The maximum quantity of Hydrogen Chloride that can be stored or handled at this facility is 43,120 pounds.  (2 tube trailers of 21,560 pounds each).  Trichlorosilane is a liquid, with a maximum quantity that can be stored or handled at this facility is 72,150 pounds. Trichlorosilane is also used in the deposition of a silicon layer on top of a polished wafer.\n\nHydrogen is used in several processes in the facility.  It is frequently used as a carrier gas for other chemicals.  Hydrogen is stored as a liquefied gas at cryogenic temperature (-423 F).  The maximum quantity of Hydrogen that can presently be stored or handled at this facility is 23,624 pounds.\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nSEH America has a proactive approach to prevent accidental"

We engineer the highest standards of safety and environmental management into our systems. \n\nSEH America will respond with its Emergency Response Team to all emergency situations including leaks or suspected leaks. To be prepared for the unlikely event that a release does occur, SEH maintains a highly trained and always ready Emergency Response Team that works closely with the Vancouver Fire Department. \n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nSEH America complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility follows guidelines and recommended practices of the Compressed Gas Association for the safe handling and use of compressed gases such as hydrogen and hydrogen chloride. Numerous safety systems are used to prevent, detect, and mitigate releases of hazardous materials.  These include regular piping inspections, process area chemical detectors, process alarms and shutdowns, mitigation systems such as scrubbers and water sprays, and systems that fail in the safe position.\n\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSEH America has never had a release of a regulated substance that has resulted in any deaths, injuries, off-site impacts or significant property damage on-site.\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nSEH America has developed an emergency response program to prevent and respond to accidental chemical releases of hazardous materials.  The facility coordinates its response plan with members of the local Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of which SEH America is an active member.  SEH has developed and trained an emergency response team that is highly qualified to respond to releases of hazardous materials, and is available on-site 24 hours a day.  The team regularly tra"
