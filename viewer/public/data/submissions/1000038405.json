The plant has 2,500 pounds of chlorine and 2,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide on-site in order to disinfect the plant's discharge and to dechlorinate prior to discharge to the receiving stream in compliance with the KPDES discharge permit. The City is anticipating upgrading the existing treatment plant in the next 3-5 years and will consider eliminating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nThe City had a Wastewater Treatment Plant Process Safety Management and Hazardous Chemical Handling Plan developed to address emergency response, prevention, and employee training. The original plan was developed May 2000 with revisions in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2013. The policy, during a large leak event, requires the plant personnel to leave the plant, contact the Versailles Fire and Police Departments as quickly and as safely as possible. Any civilian evacuation will be coordinated and executed by the local Police and Fire officials.  The release prevention plan includes the above emergency response for a large event, the yearly inspection of all gas lines, vavles, and injectors, the yearly review of operating procedures and yearly employee training.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response procedures are coordinated through local emergency responders and updates to the ER are conducted on a routine basis.
