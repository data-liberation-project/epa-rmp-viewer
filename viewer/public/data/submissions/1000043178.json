Treatment includes chlorination of water with two (2) one&#8208;ton chlorine cylinders located at the facility\r\n(4,000 lbs total). The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1 % chlorine\r\nby weight. The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements because they contain threshold quantities of regulated\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe facilities general accidental release prevention program is comprised of operator training, facility maintenance, procedural reviews, and routine\r\nequipment inspections. These programs are outlined within 40 CFR 68 Subpart C Program 2 Prevention Program. Additionally, the facility complies\r\nwith 40 CFR Subpart E Emergency Response regulations. Although the facility has elected to evacuate in the event of a release, the program\r\nestablishes notification procedures to alert the public and response resources.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\r\n\r\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.
