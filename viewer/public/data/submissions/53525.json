EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calvert City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care? to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation, and is RC14001 Certified.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Calvert City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at ISP's Calvert City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Calvert City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n1.1\t\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities, skills and training, and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid Association, Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP),"

Calvert Industry, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Calvert City Fire Department have also established a system for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\r\n     \r\n     ISP's Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program for EPA-regulated processes at their respective facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Compliance Director, Safety-Health & Security Manager, and Safety Engineer.

The ISP Plant is the largest industrial employer (approximately 520 site employees) in Marshall County.  We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: acetylene, ammonia, benzene, acetone, ethanol, butanediol, vinyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, iodine, styrene, methanol, propane, cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, isobutylene, and isopropyl acetate. The ISP Calvert City Plant makes a variety of products:  Butyrolactone, 2-pyrrolidone, Vinyl Pyrrolidone, Poly Vinyl Pyrroli"

In addition, the Calvert City Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\n1.4.2\tProcess Safety Information\r\n     \r\n     The Calvert City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n     \r\n     Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating manuals.  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n     \r\n     The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings,"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n     \r\n     The Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n     \r\n     The PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. \r\n\r\n1.4.4\tOperating Procedures\r\n     \r\n     The Calvert City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  The Plant maintains SWPP 19, Contractor Safety, which specifically addresses contractor safe work practices and is reviewed for accuracy and updates every 3 years.
