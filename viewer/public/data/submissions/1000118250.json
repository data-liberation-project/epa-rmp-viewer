The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially effected neighbors.\n\nCorporate Safety Policy:\n\nSafety is a core value of PPES, and it is the policy of this Company to provide its employees, visitors, and\ncontractors with a safe and healthy site of employment.\n\nThe acceptable standard of performance in safety matters is to promote safe work practices, achieve zero accidents or injuries in all aspects of our operations, and fully comply with all applicable rules, regulations, laws, contractual requirements and \"best practices.\" Additionally, we will continually seek opportunities to improve safety including an aggressive \"Lessons Learned\" process and will provide all applicable information to our employees and customers.\n\nIn achieving this objective, all PPES organizations, divisions, and subsidiaries develop, implement, and ensure compliance with effective safety procedures as applicable to their specific environment. In these actions, the Company will continue to emphasize that each employee is responsible for his or her own safety, the safety of fellow employees, and the safety of the public.\n\nEmployees are expected to be mentally alert and work safely as a condition of employment.

We will take appropriate action to correct noted deficient areas, keep accurate and complete information, and make regular reports to PPES Management.\n\nThis Policy is disseminated to each of our employees, contractors, and customers.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Plum Point Energy Station consists of one (1) pulverized coal-fired boiler. The facility has a gross\noutput of 723.3 MW, with a net output of 665 MW. The boiler utilizes Low NOx burners and overfire air in conjunction with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) module for NOx control. Anhydrous Ammonia, as a vapor is injected into the SCR module for conversion of the NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.\n\nAdditional emission control equipment associated with the pulverized coal-fired boiler include baghouse for particulate control, activated carbon injection for mercury control, and a Spray Dryer Absorber / Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization unit for SO2 control. The Spray Dryer Absorber operation utilizes calcium hydroxide for SO2 removal.\n\nThe facility also operates a 285 MMBtu/hr #2 fuel oil fired Auxiliary Boiler used to assist with startup of the coal-fired boiler and emergency operations. The Auxiliary Boiler is limited to 500 hours of operations per years. The Auxiliary Boiler does not utilize any RMP/PSM regulated"

A 12,750-gallon\nworking capacity anhydrous ammonia storage tank has been constructed at the site.

A management system has been developed with clearly defined accountability and responsibility for the Risk Management Program.\n\nTo help ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, PPES maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.
