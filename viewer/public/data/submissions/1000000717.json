There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1996, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plants. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific for each Water Plant. The Manual was issued to the plants. In 1999 the Manual was expanded to address the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nKey items included in the updated manual are:\n\no A written Management Program defining the positions and individuals responsible for implementing the RMP and PSM regulations\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits\n\no Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no Standard Operating Procedures for safe Chlorine Management\n\no A Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine equipment \n\no An Emergency Response Plan to address chlorine emergencies and offsite response and communication\n\nNext, these steps have been continually implemented to maintain compliance with the PMP/PSM program.\n\nO  Training on RMP/PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\no Conducting periodically Process Hazards Analyses for the two chlorine processes;\n\no Implementing the Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine regulators, controls and material handling equipments such as cranes\n\no Conducting Self Audits to review compliance with the elements of RMP and PSM\n\no Chlorine Response Drills have been routinely conducted since 1998.\no Performing an annual review of our Chlorine Operating Procedures\n\nThe Assistant Director of Public Services / Water Resources, Water Treatment Manager, Maintenance Supervisor and several plant operators"

      "SummaryText": " and mechanics meet at least one time per year to review and update procedures and to develop a schedule to maintain compliance with all aspects of the RMP/PSM regulation.\n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plants have implemented or are considering a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\n-Chlorine leak detection alarm systems have been upgraded at both plants. These systems will allow an early detection of and response to any chlorine leak.\n\n- Cameras have been added at both plants for visual inspection of the tanks and pressurized feed systems.  Additional fencing around the chlorine area has been installed at the Wiggins Mill Plant and Toisnot Plants\n        \nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Wilson has had an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site. The committee's duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nWithin the Water Treatment Division, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n- Lockout/Tagout\n\n- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had a strong safety record with no loss time accident over the past three years. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\nReport by:\n\nBarry Parks  \nAssistant Director of Public Services / Water Resources\nCity of WilsonCity of Wilson\nWilson, North Carolina\n\n"
