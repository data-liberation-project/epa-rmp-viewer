No reportable chlorine releases have occurred since startup. \n\nPlant operators have since startup practiced industry standard to safety manage chlorine. Activities included standard operating procedures, two man teams for cylinder changes and a preventative maintenance program. In 2000, the sites upgraded to a full vacuum system to deliver chlorine. This change eliminated a pressure regulator and pressure section of piping reducing the risk of a chorine release. \n\nUp to the 4th quarter of 2005, ONWASA had maintained an inventory of less than 1,500 pounds of chlorine at each plant through administrative controls. In late 2004, to meet expanding demand, ONWASA realized that higher chlorine addition rates would be required. As a result, the decision was made to increase chlorine inventories to 4,000 pounds at each plant. \n\nThe increased inventories are above the thresholds for compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program (1,500 pounds) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and thus would trigger compliance with both regulations.          \n\nTo achieve compliance, ONWASA obtained the serviced of an engineering group with extensive PSM and RMP experience. During the period from July to November 2005, the engineering group provided services such as listed below to bring both plants into full PSM and RMP compliance:\n\n?    Compiling Process Safety Information for each site \n?    Conducting and documenting a Process Hazards Analysis for each site\n?    Assisting with the development of Standard Operating Procedures\n?    Providing RMP, PSM and chlorine safety training\n?    Establish a structured Mechanical Integrity program\n?    Providing procedures fo"
