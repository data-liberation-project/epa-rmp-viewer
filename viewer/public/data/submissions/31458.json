It is the policy of Parmalat that each employee has a safe healthful place in which to work. It is also the policy of the company to expect each employee to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety. It is Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies' policy to coordinate adequate emergency response capabilities to handle an on site emergency regarding RMP-covered chemicals. Parmalat executes this policy through employee training, education, coordination and drills with local emergency response agencies.\n\nFacility Description \n\nThe Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies facility is located on 777 Memorial Drive, in eastern Atlanta, Georgia. The facility is situated just off Interstate Highway 20 in Fulton County. Parmalat produces various dairy products at this facility. Raw milk is delivered via tank trucks, and is processed to make milk, chocolate milk, buttermilk and egg nog. Additionally, various fruit juices are manufactured at this facility. The finished products are packaged for retail distribution.\nParmalat's products require constant refrigeration. The refrigeration system utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a single stage closed loop system. In general, ammonia gas is compressed and the high pressure ammonia gas then moves on to condensers located on the roof of the production facility. The ammonia is condensed to a liquid and is routed to the high pressure receiver. The receiver is located outside the compressor room. From the receiver the ammonia travels to the various coolers and process tanks where it passes through an expansion valve. The rapid expansion of the liquid ammonia returns it to the gaseous state as it removes heat from the product/room. The low pressure ammonia gas then passes through an accumulator where any remaining liquid is separated out, and then the ammonia gas feeds back to the ammonia compressors.\n\nAnhydrous ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia is purchased for use in the facility's refrigeration system. A private company delivers ammonia to the site, as necessary via tank truck. The largest quantity of ammonia is typically stored in the high pressure receiver, located outside the facility's compressor room. The high pressure receiver has a maximum capacity of 13200 pounds. However, normal operating conditions are for the high pressure receiver to maintain an inventory of 12000 pounds. The entire ammonia refrigeration system typically contains approximately 13000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nParmalat is also covered under the Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) of highly hazardous chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119. Therefore the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements as identified in the RMP.\n\nSummary of Hazards\n\nAmmonia (NH3) at normal temperatures and pressures is a colorless gas. Each molecule of ammonia contains one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen. It is lighter than air and has a pungent odor that serves as a warning of its presence. While ammonia is a relatively toxic substance, it is not a cumulative poison. It is highly soluble in water and forms a solution known as ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or aqua ammonia (commonly used as a household cleaner).\n\nAnhydrous ammonia as the liquid form of pure ammonia gas, technically water free, and the substance used universally as an industrial refrigerant. Ammonia has a higher refrigeration effect, per unit liquid volume, than any other type of commonly used refrigerant. Other advantages are low initial cost and low pipe friction pressure losses.\n\nFor transport purposes, anhydrous ammonia is classified as a non flammable gas by the U.S. Department Of Transport (DOT).\n\nExposure to ammonia causes intense irritation to the surface tissues of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Parmalat facility involves a leak in the ammonia storage tank that results in a loss of "

This population size of the affected area is 21000 based on the Landview 6 database\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for the Parmalat facility was chosen to be a rupture in a liquid ammonia line. This has the potential to impact public receptors in the area that includes schools, public parks, residential areas and commercial buildings. The population size of the affected area is 480 based on the Landview 6 database.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) relating to the covered processes resides in several forms. PSI relating to chemical hazards is included in the MSDSs that are kept in readily accessible locations for all employees. PSI relating to the process technology is generally indicated on process drawings, and is referenced in applicable operating procedures and engineering files. PSI relating to process equipment is located in the Maintenance Manager's office.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted on each covered process every five years, or when the process changes. A PHA of the ammonia refrigeration process was conducted in March 2003. The PHAs are conducted as necessary to meet PSM and RMP requirements.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration process are current and accurate. The last revision/review of the operating procedures was conducted in March 2004. Certification of the accuracy of the operating procedures is dated March 10th, 2004.\n\nTraining\n\nParmalat provides on the job training and classroom training to employees responsible for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.

Tests and inspections follow applicable and acceptable codes and standards at a frequency called for by the applicable and acceptable codes and standards, or more frequently if needed. Maintenance employees are trained on the acceptable work practices relating to the inspection and testing requirements.\nRefresher training is provided to maintenance employees on acceptable work practices relating to the inspection, testing and maintenance requirements.\n\nManagement Of Change\n\nParmalat has a written Management Of Change (MOC) procedure that ensures that proposed changes to the ammonia refrigeration system address: the technical basis of the proposed change; the impact on environment, health and safety; modifications to operating procedures; the time period of the change and the authorization requirements for the proposed change. The procedure also addresses employee training and updating of process safety information.\n\nPre Start Up Safety Review\n\nParmalat has a written Pre Start Up Safety Review (PSSR) procedure. The procedure confirms that prior to the introduction of anhydrous ammonia to new /modified equipment: construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures are in place; the MOC requirements have been met; a process hazards analysis has been performed (if necessary) and employees have been properly trained.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nParmalat conducts a com"

Investigation teams are comprised of representatives from safety, maintenance, production and any other affected groups (e.g. contractors). Investigations are initiated within 48 hours of the incident. Incident investigation reports contain at a minimum: date of incident, description of the incident, investigation team members, factors contributing to the incident and the recommended corrective actions. Management will review open corrective actions on a regular basis to ensure they receive a high priority for accomplishment.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies actively encourages employee participation at all levels of development, implementation and maintenance of the RMP program.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Hot Work Permit System covers such items as: appropriate fire protection, fire watch requirements, time frame for work to be conducted, equipment to be worked on, the individual responsible for the work and approval of the work.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Parmalat facility has 24 hour security. A security guard is in attendance at the main entrance 24 hours per day. Contractors must stop at the main gate and be cleared for entry. Parmalat has developed a contractor approval procedure that ensures the contractor safety record is considered during the contractor selection process.
