The maximum quantity on-hand exceeds the threshold limit as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act. \n\n\n\nThe City of Ponca City and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  This is evident by the long-established training procedures utilized by the City.  PCWTP follows a strict operation, safety, and maintenance program to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility. This facility has not had a release within the last five years\n\n\n\nThe PCWTP supplies drinking water to its customers and rural water districts.  The process itself can treat up to 16 mgd.  Chlorine is used to inactivate pathogenic organisms in the treated water before distribution and to maintain a chlorine residual to protect the water quality.  The chlorine supply is pulled from the ton container under a vacuum.  The presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere in case of piping failure.  This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, which eliminates all pressure piping in the system.  At the chlorinator, the gas is converted to a solution, thereby minimizing any potential hazards.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of a 1-ton cylinder resulting in a downwind distance to the toxic end point (AEGL-2) of 2.8 miles using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. The alternate scenario represents the leak from a valve from the cylinder. This assumed a release of 378 pounds and results in a downwind distance to the toxic end point (AEGL-2) of 939 yards (0.53 miles). This alternate is the release scenario assumed as the most likely to occur.  \n\n\n\nThe City of Ponca City Water Plant h"

Plant personnel would call 911 to notify the fire department for emergency response.  Next, personnel would contact the Ponca City Emergency Management at (580)767-0380.  Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required\n\n"
