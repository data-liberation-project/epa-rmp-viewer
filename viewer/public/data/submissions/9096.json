      "SummaryText": "Clean Air Act Amendments Section 112(r)(7)\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs:\n40 CFR Part 68 - Subpart G\nRisk Management Plan\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department's Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is a stationary source that is subject to the Risk Management Programs under the Clean Air Act, Section 112 (r)(7) (as promulgated in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68).  The Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant stores chlorine in quantities in excess of the 2,500 pound Risk Management Program threshold.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR ' 68.150, the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is required to submit a single Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes the information required by '' 68.155 through 68.185.  The Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is also required to provide an executive summary in the RMP.  The following is a brief description of various elements of the facility's Risk Management Program, as required by 40 CFR ' 68.155:\n\n(a) THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) operates five water treatment plants in the Southeast Michigan area.  While the production of potable drinking water is vital to the welfare of the community, DWSD recognizes that the safe handling of the chlorine used in the water disinfection process is also critical to the welfare of the community.  DWSD recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nDWSD is committed to the implementation of stringent safety precautions for chlorine handling at all of its water treatment facilities.  These safety precautions are necessary to prevent accidental releases of chlorine that could threaten the health of DWSD employees, DWSD contractors, and the members of the community DWSD serves.  To this end, DWSD implements routine equipment maintenance a"

The Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant was designed to produce 800 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated water.  The plant typically produces between 110 and 250 MGD of treated water, with a daily average of 136 MGD during the 1998 fiscal year.  \n\nSurface water from Lake Huron is pumped to the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant via a six-mile long tunnel.  The plant adds aluminum sulfate (alum) to the water to aid in the removal of particulate matter.  The alum produces a precipitate that binds to fine particles; the resulting larger particles settle out.  On an as-needed basis, the plant uses its Carbon System to add activated carbon to the water.  Activated carbon can remove tastes and odors that may exist in raw water from Lake Huron.  The plant uses its Fluoride System to add  fluoride to the water.  The fluoride provides water consumers with protection against tooth decay.  The plant's Alum, Carbon, and Fluoride Systems do not contain chemicals that are designated as regulated toxic or flammable substances pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.  \n\nThe plant's Chlorine System disinfects the water.  The water disinfection occurs at the beginning of the treatment process (pre-chlorination) and as a final treatment step (post-chlorination).  The primary components of the plant's Chlorine System include a maximum of twenty-five (25) 2,000 pound cylinders of chlorine, four (4) evaporators, five (5) chlorinators, and the associated chlorinated water distribution components (e.g., polyvinylchloride piping).  In April 1999, the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant's entire Chl"

The facility was also equipped with a new chlorine abatement system (scrubber) that is capable of neutralizing the contents of one 2,000 pound cylinder of chlorine. \n\nChlorine is designated as a \"regulated toxic substance\" pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.  The Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant has more than the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds) of chlorine in its water disinfection process; therefore, the attached Risk Management Plan addresses this single covered process. \n\n(c) THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO \n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program guidance document for Wastewater Treatment Plants (Chapter 4: Offsite Consequence Analysis) was referenced in the development of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario involves the release of the entire contents of the greatest amount held in a single vessel (i.e., 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas) within an enclosure (building).  Assuming a wind speed 1.5 meters/second, atmospheric stability class F, relative humidity 50%, a maximum air temperature of 770F, a release duration of 10 minutes, and a ground level release in a rural area, the toxic endpoint for chlorine (0.0087 mg/L or 3 parts per million) would be located within 2.3 miles of the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario assumes that the outlet valve on one 2,000 pound chlorine cylinder leaks from a 1/8 inch diameter opening, and that the release occurs within an enclosure (building).  Assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, atmospheric stability class D, relative humidity 50%, a maximum air temperature of 770F, a release duration of 13 minutes, and a ground level relea"

      "SummaryText": "se in a rural area, the toxic endpoint for chlorine (0.0087 mg/L or 3 parts per million) would be located within 0.42 miles of the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant.\n\nIt should be noted that the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a scrubber that is capable of neutralizing the contents of one 2,000 pound cylinder of chlorine.  A release as described above would not result in any off-site release if the scrubber was functioning properly.  In 40 CFR 112 '68.28 (b)(ii), the U.S. EPA specifies that the alternative release scenario analysis shall \" reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.\" Therefore, for the purposes of this scenario, the mitigating effect of the scrubber has not been considered. \n\n(d) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant stores, handles, and uses chlorine in its water purification process.  The Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant has established a Process Safety Management Plan. The information contained within this PSM Plan establishes the protocols and procedures needed to safely handle and use chlorine. The plan is designed to prevent and minimize the effects of an unplanned, sudden or non-sudden incident involving chlorine.  This plan is designed to meet the regulatory requirements of MIOSHA, Rule #40819102 - Process Safety Management Program.\n\nSpecifically this plan protects the community using a combination of operating procedures and safe work practices, equipment design, emergency operations and shut-down procedures, building design, containment, chlorine scrubbing equipment, and employee training and education.\n\nThe requirements of the Process Safety Management Plan will be implemented as an on-going compliance policy to ensure that chlorine is safely stored, handled, and used by the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant.  This plan provides direction for the current and future use and handling of chlorine, and ensures that any rel"

The Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is also included in an Emergency Response Plan that was developed for all Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) facilities.  The DWSD Emergency Response Plan has an appendix that specifically addresses accidental releases of chlorine.  The plans address the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, emergency first aid and medical treatment, response strategies and incident command, evacuation procedures, and specific procedures for responding to chlorine releases.\n\nLake Huron Water Treatment Plant personnel that have the potential for responding to accidental releases of chlorine have received formal emergency response training (i.e., 40-Hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training).  In addition, the plant's chlorine supplier has routinely provided chlorine-specific emergency response training to plant employees.   \n\nThe Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is equipped with seven (7) chlorine detectors.  Two detectors are located in the passageway between the filter building and the chemical building; three detectors are located in the chlorine storage/evaporator room; and two detectors are located in the chlorinator room.  If a chlorine detector senses chlorine at a concentration of 1 part per million or greater, a"

The external notification of local emergency response agencies and the public would be conducted on an as-needed basis, in accordance with the facility's Emergency Response Plan. \n\nIn the event of a release, the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a scrubber that is capable of neutralizing the contents of one 2,000 pound cylinder of chlorine.  \n \n(g) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThe Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant completed a major renovation of its chlorine system in the spring of 1999; therefore, no major process changes are expected at the plant in the near future.\n\nThe Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant is in the process of updating and revising its current Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe City of Detroit is currently initiating the use of a new computer program for purchasing, training, and preventive maintenance.  This computer program will be used by all City of Detroit operations, including the water treatment plants.  When the program is fully implemented it will issue work orders for preventive maintenance, record all preventive maintenance activities, and maintain training records.  The computer program is expected to be fully operational before the end of the 1999 calendar year."
