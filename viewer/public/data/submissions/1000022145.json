The Greenville facility employs approximately 75 employees, which includes 25 truck drivers and 3 clerical staff members. The company has been in business since 1976 and has its corporate headquarters in Decatur, IL. \n\n2.    Continental Carbonic Products is in compliance with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations and applicable accidental release reporting requirements. Upon having an accidental release of a reportable quantity, immediate notifications will be made to local, state and federal agencies. The facility is equipped with both visual and audible alarms, which will alert employees and visitors of an accidental release.\n\n3.    There have been no releases or ammonia accidents in the past five years.\n\n4.    The facility works with the local emergency response agencies for emergency actions. Employees are trained to leave the building immediately upon being notified of an anhydrous ammonia release. Upon exiting building, employees will observe the wind direction indicated by the wind sock to ensure they evacuate to a safe location up-wind. The evacuation plan will be communicated during initial employee training and on regular basis thereafter. \n\na.    The worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the extent for each scenario. \n\n5.    Continental Carbonic's maintenance department has a preventative maintenance program for checking and maintaining ammonia valves, piping and associated equipment. Weekly, monthly and annual inspections will be conducted. Additionally, all controls and valves are marked and painted.\n\n"
