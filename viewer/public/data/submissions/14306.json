      "SummaryText": "The General Manager enforces safety as a condition of employment. The City Corporation accidental release prevention program is a time-tested combination of written standard operating procedures, operator training, and proven common sense performance. Operational process checks are documented no less than six times each day and process area monitoring alarms are checked monthly for proper operation. Supervisors ensure that process safety management standards are met at all times.\n\nThe City Corporation Wastewater Treatment Plant treats an average of four million gallons of municipal wastewater from the city of Russellville each day. The regulated chemical, chlorine, is used to disinfect the treated wastewater before it is discharged into waters of the state. The dual tank setup for chlorination uses one-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine. With two spare tanks, the plant can have as much as four tons of liquid chlorine on site at any time.\n\nEPA's RMP*Comp model used to determine the worst-case scenario, a catastrophic release of a one ton container of liquid chlorine into the atmosphere, shows the toxic endpoint to be 0.9 miles from the treatment plant. Significant public receptors inside this radius from the plant include the Russellville High School, Timberwood Subdivision, and numerous family and commercial establishments. A catastrophic rupture assumes a circumstance which City Corporation has not experienced in the 35 years this plant has  operated. An alternate scenario, such as a ruptured disk or leaking tank with a somewhat controlled release, shows a toxic endpoint to be 0.2 miles away from the plant. This scenario would barely leave the plant property and only possibly affect three to four nearby residences.\n\nTime has shown that intensive operator training, regular maintenance, and reputable equipment have proven to be good prevention. The dangers of chlorine are graphically tought to our operators, and every effort is made to stop accidents before they happen"

Notification of the Fire Department, residents, and businesses within a mile of the plant begins immediately. A hand-picked team of experienced operators with HAZWOPER training have access to SCBA's, Level A chemical protection suits, and a chlorine \"B\" kit (one-ton cylinder repair kit). A process monitoring alarm will give early warning to an accidental release, and a wind sock on top of the chlorination building can easily be seen to determine wind direction.\n\nCity Corporation has contacted the Pope County LEPC about this plan. Periodic reviews and updates will be filed as needed. City Corporation will also consider installation of mitigation equipment to reduce the risk of an accidental chlorine release."
