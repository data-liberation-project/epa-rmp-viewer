The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, the public, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.\n\nIn addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated based on modifications to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program is reviewed on an annual basis.

Managed changes include those to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and facilities. Special consideration is given to the technical basis for the change, as well as safety and health impacts, operating procedure modifications, time period for the change and authorization requirements. All changes are reviewed and approved by knowledgeable personnel from various disciplines to ensure that potential new hazards are managed and any controls in place are not adversely affected. Affected employees and other workers receive training on the change prior to its implementation. In addition, process safety information and operating procedures are revised to reflect any changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nShould an incident occur that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of regulated substances, LAR promptly begins a thorough investigation. A knowledgeable investigation team determines the cause and develops corrective action recommendations to prevent recurrence. Refinery Management tracks the resolution of corrective actions. Investigation findings are available for review by all affected personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAudits to ensure the proper functioning of the accident prevention program are conducted at LAR at least every three years. A cross functional audit team carefully reviews facility practices and documents findings for management's review and implementation.

These PSSRs ensure that important aspects of a project, such as safety, procedures, personnel, and equipment, are prepared and reviewed before equipment is placed in service.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nProcedures are maintained at LAR to ensure the integrity of process equipment including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems/devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and testing are key components of the mechanical integrity program, with elements and frequency following accepted industry good, engineering practices and manufacturers' recommendations, augmented by operating experience. All work is documented. Deficiencies that are identified are corrected prior to further use of the equipment or reviewed by a qualified team to determine actions to be taken to ensure safe operations. Quality assurance measures are in place to ensure that new equipment is suitable to the service for which it is intended and is properly installed. Maintenance materials and spare parts are also checked for compatibility with the process and equipment.
