The Facility Policy POSEYVILLE PROPANE\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Posey County Coop should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities. To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\na The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nb Propane is received, stored, and distributed in our farmer customers for  both heat and fuel. \n\nc The maximum quantity stored would be 115260 pounds in the largest storage tanks. The largest of which is 30,000 gallons. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a TANK TRUCK  holding 9000 GALLONS.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 115260 lbs  which  represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the flammible endpoint is .4 miles.\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the flammable endpoint  is .4 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), NFPA 58 & the uniform Fire code.\n\n5. The five-year Accident History (either a. or b.). (see Attached List)\n\na THERE have been no accidents that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; nor To our knowledge, have resulted in offside deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in pla"
