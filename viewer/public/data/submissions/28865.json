Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Food Services of Cincinnati, LLC are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Evendale Fire Department, who provides our off-site emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 8,640 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site analyses for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp program provided by the EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Sysco Food Services of Cincinnati, LLC.  The scenario involves the release of 8,640 pounds of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid and gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 864, and a distance to endpoint of 1.5 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 5,585 within this dist"

The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of .2 miles is obtained, which does not affect any residents within this distance.  \n\nThere are no Flammables Worst-Case or Alternative-Case analyses for this facility.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and maintenance and are revalidated a a regular interval of every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nSysco Food Services of Cincinnati, LLC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.
