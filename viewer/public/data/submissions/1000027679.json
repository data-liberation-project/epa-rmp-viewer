      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSiouxland Ethanol, LLC\n\n\n\nSiouxland Ethanol, LLC (Siouxland) is an existing ethanol facility located in Jackson, Nebraska.  Siouxland began operations at the ethanol plant in May 2007.  The RMP and any information or reports associated with the RMP are an established part of Siouxland's procedures and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that Siouxland is an existing facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  Siouxland has not undergone a change in management since the start up of facility operations. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nSiouxland has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nSiouxland's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are located in a large bermed area referred to as the Tank Farm.  The tank farm has a large containment structure and is separated from the facility process areas by a plant road.  It is not expected that a release from one of these tanks would be able to migrate off-site and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  Siouxland has coordinated with the Ponca Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Siouxland facility is located on Knox Boulevard, approximately 1.24 mile northwest of Jackson, Dakota County, Nebraska.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under "

      "SummaryText": "the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Siouxland has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 5.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on-site.\n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.    Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, 97,200 pounds, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of this documentation detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also provided as part of this documentation.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, included as part of this documentation.  Schools, recreation areas, residences, and a golf course are within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  There are no environmental receptors within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  \n\n\n\n2.    Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 165,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to de"

The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 924,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 924,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 314,160 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112 (r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, included as part of this documentation.  Schools, recreation areas, and residences are within the worst case distance to endpoint for denaturant.  There are no environmental receptors within the worst case distance to endpoint for denaturant.  \n\n\n\nAlternate Scenarios:\n\n3.    Anhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, included as part of this documentation.  A residence is within the alterative distance to endpoint for ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "44,800 pounds of denaturant due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents, equaling 44,800 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 15,232 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112 (r).  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6, included as part of this documentation.  No public or environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents since the start-up of operations at Siouxland Ethanol.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nSiouxland has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response; including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Siouxland's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety - which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSiouxland will continue to provide training programs to ensure the safety of employees and contractors."
