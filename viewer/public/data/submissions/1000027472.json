This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and   adversely   affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nOur facility Toll Manufactures Polyols, Polymers and Co-Polymers using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  SSI Chusei, Inc. produces these products through batch reaction technologies utilizing state of the art equipment and controls. The company has the capability to manufacture such products from the raw material conponents all the way through packaging in solid and liquid forms.

All storage tanks are equiped with level and pressure transmitters and alarms.\n\n\n\n2. All storage vessels are minimum 15 psig rated, automatic pressure controls and rupture disks are provided to prevent tank rupture due to overpressure.\n\n\n\n3. All reactors used in Allyl Alcohol or Propylene Oxide service have redundant pressure relief valves that vent to a 16,500 gallon liquid knockout vessel prior to venting to the plant flare. This prevents a release of liquid from the flare due to any upset conditions. All vessels and reactors in the OP Wax Process vent flammables to the plant flare.\n\n\n\n4. Reactor vessels in Allyl Alcohol, Propylene Oxide and OP Wax Polymerization service have control interlocks for raw material flow, temperature, high pressure, differential temperature and pressure, agitator operation and Cooling Water pump operation.

The storage vessel level is lowered to a maximum level of 3,000 gallons or less between product campaigns and where practical the tank is deinventoried when not in use.\n\n\n\n7.

Fugitive emissions testing is conducted on all equipment in VOC service on a minimum of a quarterly basis.\n\n\n\n9. Ethylene storage and transfer operations comply with the industry standards for Ethylene Storage and we plan our production to prevent longterm Ethylene storage and the vessel venting that occurs as the Cryogenic Ethylene warms.\n\n\n\n10.

Install an new Emergency Notification System to speed notification of off site locations and residential are as of a chemical spill or release.\n\n\n\n2.
