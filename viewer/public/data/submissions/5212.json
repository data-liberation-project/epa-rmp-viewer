              "Description": "Process Safety Information:  The following information regarding the chlorine system is stored and maintained on-site.  Material Safety Data Sheets, maximum intended inventory,safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions, manufacturer's equipment specifications,  and codes and standards for design, construction and operation of the system.  The system was designed by a licensed professional engineer in accordance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  It is operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  A hazard review was conducted for this site in May, 1999.  A complete set of operating procedures are kept at the plant site.  All the employees working at this facility have been trained in all of the pertinent operatin procedures.  Complete training manuals and procedures are kept at the plant.  Refresher training is conducted by the safety manager of this facility on and as-needed basis but no less than three years.  We verify that all employees are adhering to the principles and procedures as outlined in the training programs and operating procedures.  The chlorine process equipment is maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  Routine maintenance is conducted regularly and as needed at the site.  In addition, a complete maintenance and hazard review check is conducted prior to rotation of each cylinder.  Maintenance logs are kept on site documenting all internal maintenance as well as any items completed by outside contracts.  The city has required procedures for the implementaion of any changes that will affect the chlorine feed process including, technical basis for the change, impact of the change on safety and health, required modifications to the operating procedures, required time frame, and required additional training.  A pre-startup review shall be completed at the startup of any new stationary or significantly modified source for chlorine feed.  A compliance audit will be conducted for this site a minimum of every three years.  This facility has had no incident that would qualify under Section 112(r).  A written plan of action has been developed regarding employee participation, consultation and access to process hazard analyses.  No hot work may be conducted near the facilty without the issuance of a hot work permit.  The city has required procedures for the selection and performance requirements for contractors which meet the requirements of section 68.87.",

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Chlorine is the\nonly chemical which is stored at the site in amounts above the threshold quantity as specified in EPA's\n40CFR68 and the OSHA PSM Standard 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThis facility is an activated sludge, wastewater treatment plant which uses chlorine for a disinfectant as part of\nthe treatment process.  This is one of two treatment  plants which serve the City of Warner Robins.  The plant\nis permitted for nine (9) million gallons per day and is currently operating at an average of six (6) million\ngallons per day.  Gaseous chlorine is supplied to the plant by a one(1) ton cylinder with one additional one (1)\nton cylinder as storage.  Maximum on-site storage is four thousand (4000) pounds.  The process includes\nchlorinators, injectors, vacuum regulator and associated valves, piping and safety equipment.\n\nThe worst case scenario is a failure of one of the 2000 lb. chlorine cylinders when filled to the greatest amount\nallowed resulting in a sudden release of the entire tank over a ten (10) minute interval. The distance to the\nendpoint, obtained from EPA's RMP*Comp, is 1.3 miles. There is an existing population of 3900 within the\ndistance to endpoint. Additionally, there are 8 commercial, 7 industries, 2 churches, a city owned golf course\nand a portion of a U.S. Air Force base within this distance. There are no environmental receptors within the\ndistance to endpoint. See Map 1.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and\nregulations.
