It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Chlorine is the\nonly chemical which is stored at the site in amounts above the threshold quantity as specified in EPA's\n40CFR68 and the OSHA PSM Standard 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThis facility is an activated sludge, wastewater treatment plant which uses chlorine for a disinfectant as part of\nthe treatment process.  This is one of two treatment  plants which serve the City of Warner Robins.  The plant\nis permitted for nine (9) million gallons per day and is currently operating at an average of six (6) million\ngallons per day.  Gaseous chlorine is supplied to the plant by a one(1) ton cylinder with one additional one (1)\nton cylinder as storage.  Maximum on-site storage is four thousand (4000) pounds.  The process includes\nchlorinators, injectors, vacuum regulator and associated valves, piping and safety equipment.\n\nThe worst case scenario is a failure of one of the 2000 lb. chlorine cylinders when filled to the greatest amount\nallowed resulting in a sudden release of the entire tank over a ten (10) minute interval. The distance to the\nendpoint, obtained from EPA's RMP*Comp, is 1.3 miles. There is an existing population of 3900 within the\ndistance to endpoint. Additionally, there are 8 commercial, 7 industries, 2 churches, a city owned golf course\nand a portion of a U.S. Air Force base within this distance. There are no environmental receptors within the\ndistance to endpoint. See Map 1.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and\nregulations.  The chlorine system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-55 and state\nlaw.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving chl"

In addition, our\npersonnel are trained in appropriate procedures depending on the type of incident and, if appropriate, will\ninstitute in-house procedures until such time as the fire department can respond to the emergency. We have\ndiscussed this policy with the fire department and hold regular safety training meetings with employees and\nmembers of the fire department as part of our chlorine safety program.\n\nWe have no plans at the present time to change our safety processes and procedures."
