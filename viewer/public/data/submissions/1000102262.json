These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a period of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMPLX believes that successful PSM and accident prevention programs require a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, MPLX employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP program, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nContractors\n\nPeriodically MPLX hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility, and it is the policy of MPLX to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MPLX is coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Clendenin Volunteer Fire Department, which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the Cpbb facility encompasses natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction. NGL's and Propane are the two substances present at the facility regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  NGL's, a flammable substance, are a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).  The NGL's are extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline. Once extracted, the NGL is stored in five 30,000-gallon capacity pressure vessels (801-805). The NGL is then transferred via tank truck to the Siloam Fractionation Facility. Propane, which is used as a refrigerant in the process, is stored at the facility in two (2) 1,000-gallon capacity above ground pressure vessels. The total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 85% of full capacity. Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressu"
