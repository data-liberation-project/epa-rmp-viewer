The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia that could be stored is 263,000 pounds.  Green Plains Otter Tail has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. Green Plains Otter Tail has coordinated emergency response with local authorities and responding agencies and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Green Plains Otter Tail has complied with the EPA's RMP submittal requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on an as-needed basis.

      "SummaryText": "Green Plains Otter Tail, LLC (Green Plains Otter Tail) operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Fergus Falls, in Otter Tail County, Minnesota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Green Plains Otter Tail completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that exceed reporting thresholds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGreen Plains Otter Tail is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Green Plains Otter Tail uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Green Plains Otter Tail uses aqueous ammonia for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of Green Plains Otter Tail to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Green Plains Otter Tail to notify the Fergus Falls Fire Department and the Otter Tail County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel-grade ethanol from corn and produces process co-products known as dry distillers' grain with solubles (DDGS), wet cake, and modified wet cake.  Each co-product is sold as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of natural gasoline, or denaturant, which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 317,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 127,000 pounds, assuming a 40% concentration).  The natural gasoline is stored in an aboveground tank as a liquid and is mixed with the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in a tank farm, which is s"
