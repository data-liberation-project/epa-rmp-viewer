      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \nIn this water treatment facility, we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we sue and the training of our personnel.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local Disaster and Emergency Services personnel ad the local fire and law enforcement authorities.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat drinking water and to distribute same to both residential and wholesale customers.  Chlorine is received by truck (transports) and stored in the containers that it is shipped in.  \n- Facility has equipment for loading and unloading the chlorine from the delivery trucks.  \n- Access to the chlorine storage area is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n- The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures would be the failure of one 1-ton cylinder with the total release of all contained chlorine in 10 minutes.  For worst case purposes this release is assumed to occur during unloading of a full cylinder from the delivery truck.  The release distance and affected population is defined in section 2 of this RMP.The "

      "SummaryText": "Facility has trained personell equiped with CBA units and part \"B\" repair kit. This could greatly reduce the ammount of released gas.\n\n4. Alternative Case Scenario:\nThe alternative  (more likely) release would involve the slow release of chlorine from a full cylinder over an eight-hour period.  Any minor release during working hours would result in less than a ten-minute release prior to containment and control of the leak.The Facility has trained personell equiped with SCBA units and part \"B\" repair kit. This could greatly reduce the ammount of released gas.\n\n5. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations.Employees are trained in the use of all safety equipment required to repair leaks and also limit the possibility of leaks. In 2003 the chlorine feed system was upgraded to a vacume feed system instead of pressure feed.This eliminates the possibility of a leak in a  pressure feed line.\n\n6. Five-year accident history:  \nThe facility has not experienced any chlorine releases in the last five years.\n\n7. Emergency response program:\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Division of Emergency Management's Tab Q-7.  The facility plan has been incorporated into the county-wide plan for Trimble County by the LEPC.  A representative of the county DES visited the facility in March 1999.\n\n8. Planned changes to improve safety:\n- The facility started operations in March, 1998.\n- Facility personnel will be receiving training this year to achieve compliance with the training requirements of the EPA RMP program.\n- The Trimble County LEPC will be using this facility to train local fire and law enforcement officials, DES, and facility staff by staging \"Mock Disaster Drills\" at this location."
