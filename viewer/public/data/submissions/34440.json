The Facility Policy\n       The owners, management, and employees of Watonwan Farm Service Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n                - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n        - The maximun quantity stored would be 610,000 pounds in our four-30,000 gallon and one-18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. The maximum quantity of Ammonia handled would be the unloading of a railroad tank car holding 100,000 pounds. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n        a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.12 miles with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n        b. The alternative release scenario for ammonia would be a 2 minute release of a 3 inch pipe break, resulting in a distance to the endpoint of .78 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n         The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, CFR 1910.111  \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition, Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammonia rules.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\n           a. There have b"
