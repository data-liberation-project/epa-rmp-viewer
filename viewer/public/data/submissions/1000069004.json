This facility burns natural gas in two gas turbines coupled to generators that produce electricity. The exhaust heat from each turbine is sent through two separate Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) where its thermal energy is used to heat water and generate steam. The steam is then used in a steam turbine that is also coupled to a generator thereby increasing the output of electricity. This type of plant configuration (known as \"combined-cycle\") is extremely efficient and very common. WEC maintains two substances, anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia, on-site (\"in a process\") in amounts exceeding the threshold quantities established by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) contained in 40 CFR Part 68. The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds and the threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia (greater than or equal to 20%) is 20,000 pounds. \"In a process\" means one or more tanks that are interconnected or located close enough together that a release from one tank could result in a release from neighboring tanks. WEC uses anhydrous ammonia in a closed refrigeration system used to cool gas turbine inlet air and increase power output. Aqueous ammonia is used to reduce NOx emissions by injecting ammonia vapor into the HRSG upstream of a catalyst.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP is divided into three programs with different requirements. A facility is eligible for Program 1 requirements if there have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance in the past 5 years, the distance to the \"toxic endpoint\" for a worst case scenario is less than the distance to any public receptor, and emergency response procedures are coordinated between the facility and a local emergency planning and response agency. The \"toxic endpoint\" is the concentration established by EPA at which serious injurie"

A process is subject to Program 3 if it doesn't meet the eligibility of Program 1 and it is either subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) program (29 CFR Part 1910.119) or is in NAISC code 32211, 32411, 32511, 325181, 325188, 325199, 325211, or 32532.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia process is not eligible for Program 1 due to public receptors located within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release and is not subject to Program 3. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to Program 3 requirements since it does not meet the Program 1 criteria and is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). OSHA's PSM of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals and establishes a comprehensive management program that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. \r\n\r\nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) was conducted in accordance with the latest version of the EPA-sanctioned software program RMP*Comp (version 2.01). RMP*Comp is a program approved for use performing off-site consequence analyses required under the RMP rule. RMP*Comp was developed by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous materials Response and Assessment Division, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA. The OCA is performed to determine the distance traveled by the regulated substance (ammonia) released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\". The toxic endpoint for both anhydrous and aqueous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\nWEC derived the residential population within the circles with radii defined by the endpoint of the worst case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated substance using"

      "SummaryText": "the MARPLOT (Mapping Application for Response Planning and Local Operational Tasks) version 5.1.1 (December 2017) software system developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Census, and NOAA. US census data from 2010 within MARPLOT was used to obtain the population estimates. Population demographics were obtained from the Missouri Census Data Center's Circular Area Profiles (CAPS). The residential population estimates were derived using the Block Group Uniform Population Density (BGUPD) method within MARPLOT and CAPS. The BGUPD method tallies data for each block group polygon that has any portion of the polygon falling within the radius of the circle, then prorates the results based on the ratio of the area of the circle to the land area of the block group polygon. This is done to account for the fact that there will be block groups on the circumference of the circle that are only partially within the radius and therefore their population counts need to be apportioned accordingly. This method assumes a uniform population density throughout the block groups' land area within the circle. This method may overestimate the population if the circle includes areas where no people live, such as over water or an industrial area. This method may underestimate for those block groups whose area is only partially inside the radius but whose population is concentrated in the area inside the radius. Thus, the higher the degree of non-uniformity of population density, the higher the degree of uncertainty of the results. This methodology is an accepted approach by EPA for calculating reasonable population estimates for RMP purposes.\r\n\r\nNo environmental receptors have been identified within the hazard zone.

      "SummaryText": "ublic receptors, as defined by Part 68, within the worst case scenario hazard zone include nearby residences, commercial and industrial buildings, schools, hospitals, and recreational areas. Various tools were used to identify public and environmental receptors within the circle of impact for each release scenario. The tools include MARPLOT, CAPS, USGS map (Earth Point topo map) and layer tools within Google Earth, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of state wildlife refuge areas and the list of national and state parks in Maine.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the RMP and PSM program requirements, the facility has strictly implemented preventive maintenance procedures and an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The presence of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia on site triggers the need for an emergency response program. However, in such cases where the stationary source employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances, compliance with 40 CFR 68.95, Emergency Response Program, is not required provided that the following conditions are met: \r\n\r\n1. For stationary sources with any regulated toxic substance held in a process above the threshold quantity, the stationary source is included in the community emergency response plan.\r\n2. For stationary sources with only regulated flammable substances held in a process above the threshold quantity, the owner or operator has coordinated response actions with the local fire department; and \r\n3. Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \r\n\t\r\nThe Westbrook Energy Center meets all of the above requirements. PSM regulations require facilities with greater than ten employees to prepare a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(c).
