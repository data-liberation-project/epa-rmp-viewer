The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility\n\nDescribe your facility's overall approach to chemical safety.  You may want to include any corporate policies (if applicable) and an overview of senior management commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures.\n\nOn Aril 23, 2004 Formosa Plastics Corporation, IL experienced a tragic accident which has halted production operations at the facility. Currently the site is preparing to evacuate any remaining vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate monomers from the storage tanks. These are the only processes planned for the site at this time. Although this risk management plan submittal addresses only those activities, the information supplied in this executive summary applies to all processes and operations at the site.  \n\nAll new chemicals introduced into the process and any changes to the operating conditions must go through a Management of Change approval process.  This process requires a review of the potential impact upon the operation of the facility by the Safety Department, Environmental Department, Production Department, Maintenance Department, Technical Department, Technical Service Department, PSM Coordinator and General Manager?s Office. \n\nIn addition to the approval for use through the Management of Change process it is necessary for the Chemical Approval Procedure to be followed if a new chemical is to be purchased or if a change is to occur in the existing storage arrangements of a chemical. The chemical approval review is conducted by the Safety Department and the Environmental Department to ensure the safety of employees and the community as it pertains to the storage and handling of chemicals.\n\nOnce approval to purchase and use a chemical has been obtained, the Department in which the chemical is to be used is responsible for providing the necessary training on the safe use and handling of the chemical.

These audits are designed to ensure that the procedures are effective at controlling potential hazards and ensuring that the procedures are being properly followed.\n\n In the event that an emergency condition were to develop the site shift supervisor would act as the incident commander until he would be relived by the local fire chief.  At this point the fire chief would serve as the incident commander with extensive consultation being made with the site shift supervisor.  Through this team effort the emergency would be controlled quickly and safely.\n\nB. Your facility and the regulated substances handled \n\nProvide a description of your facility so that the public has a clear picture of the facility, its processes, and products.  Describe the primary activities at the facility (e.g., manufacturer of polyethylene, pulp mill, etc.) and the regulated substances used.  In addition, you may want to mention the quantities of these substances handled or stored at your facility.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe facility at Illiopolis, IL first began operations in the early 1950?s and was purchased by Formosa Plastics Corporation in April 2002. The site currently employs 76 full-time employees.  The major components of the facility involve three PVC Polymerization units, three dryer units, an automatic bagging plant, waste water treatment plant, and the finished goods warehouse.  The plant production capability is 180 tons of PVC Resin per day. Please note that portions of the facility were damaged during the 4/23/04 incident. \n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES:\nThe only activities currently planned for the facility are the removal of chemicals from "

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nYou may wish to mention the rules and regulations with which your facility complies, such as the OSHA PSM rule. You should also highlight practices that you believe are important to your prevention program.  The steps you list may be either technological (e.g., backup systems) or procedural/managerial (e.g., improved maintenance or training).\n\nOSHA PSM\n\nDue to the fact that the facility uses, stores, and handles Vinyl Chloride and Vinyl Acetate, and the fact that the quantities are greater than 10,000 pounds, the facility must comply with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  This regulation requires that several conditions must be met such as; ensuring that Hot Work Permits are issued for welding and cutting operations, conducting routine compliance audits to ensure compliance, mechanical integrity to ensure the equipment is properly maintained and conducting process hazard analyses.  Each of these requirements ensure that employees are provided with a safe working environment and in turn ensure that the community are adequately protected.\n\nNESHAP\n Vinyl Chloride is a regulated substance under the EPA NESHAP Standard.  The regulations requires extensive monitoring of all valves and flanges to ensure that leaks of Vinyl Chloride are not occurring. The end result of this program is the ability to quickly respond to potential leaks at concentrations that are well below levels that would either impact our employees health and safety or the health and safety of the community. \n\nAmbient Air Monitoring Program\n\nIn an effort to respond quickly to potential hazardous conditions an ambient air monitoring system and associated program has been implemented.

This allows employees to be informed quickly so that immediate action can be taken to locate and stop possible leaks. \n\n5 - 50 and >50 PPM Emission Investigation Program\n\nThe 1 - 50 ppm and >50 ppm emission investigation programs were voluntarily instituted to pro-actively determine the date, time, cause, equipment, shift, location and probable cause of potential VCM emissions.  When the ARCAS emissions monitors detect a concentration of VCM in the facility greater than or equal to 1 ppm, the area operators contact their supervisor immediately and investigate the source of the VCM.  Once the source is identified the necessary corrective actions are immediately implemented.  Once the situation has been corrected, a more thorough investigation, depending on concentration, is conducted to determine the root cause of the incident and to implement preventive measures to prevent recurrence of the situation. Corrective actions, that are the result of a > 50ppm emission, are tracked through the site?s ISO non-conformance process to ensure timely completion and a determination of the effectiveness of the action to prevent future leaks.\n\nThe FPC-IL site had achieved registration to both the ISO9002 and ISO14001 standards but is voluntarily suspending registration untilsuch time as operations resume.\n\nD. The five-year accident history\n\nDo not present accident history information in table form here; more details will be provided in the data elements.
