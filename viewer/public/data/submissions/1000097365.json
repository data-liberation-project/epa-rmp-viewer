CTI Foods is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at CTI Foods. \n\n\n\nIt is CTI Foods' policy to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  To accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established safety programs that enable plant personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare plant personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods facility draws from decades of internal experience and expertise, as well as resources of our parent company, CTI Foods, to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the plant's safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).

The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 50,800 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\n\n\nFor example, all compressors are routinely inspected for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings and sensor calibrations are performed every 6 months;  the condensers are inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure receiver oil pots are drained, pump pressures are recorded and pumps and valves are defrosted for excessive ice build-up;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating limit conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year frequency.  Ammonia leak detectors are calibrated semi-annually and trigger local audible and visual alarms for plant operators.  Machinery room ventilation systems operate continuously and are designed for exhaust rates which exceed the emergency exhaust requirements.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.

When heat is absorbed by the liquid ammonia, it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers, where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor, causing it to condense to a liquid.\n\n\n\nMultiple pump recirculator packages at different temperatures / pressures are utilized for the various refrigerated zones at the facility that include spiral freezers for product, and cold storage evaporators ranging from freezer storage rooms to dock applications.\n\n\n\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the ammonia system including:  ammonia leak detection, auto purger to remove non-condensible gasses, pressure relief system, and refrigeration control system.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequences of a significant release, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\n\n\nPrograms developed for the PSM/RMP programs include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractor management, and incident investigation.

The ultimate goal for CTI Foods' PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern our network of ammonia refrigeration facilities, as well as the ammonia refrigeration industry.\n\n\n\nThe CTI Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  The CTI Foods facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically outline requirements for the design and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the machinery room, continuous automated ventilation, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, and emergency stop controls.  The majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located inside the machine room.
