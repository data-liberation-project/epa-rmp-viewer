      "SummaryText": "Twin Castle Farms\nDavid Weinman\n6708 Friendsville Road\nWooster, Ohio 44691\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Facility Policy\n\n    The owners and management of Twin Castle Farm are committed to the prevention of accidental release of any hazardous substance from our facility.  This facility has utilized hazardous products for over twenty years without one off-site accidental release.  However, if an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to our neighbors and the environment.  The facility has implemented every constructive suggestion from local fire departments, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Ohio Department of Agriculture's Fertilizer Division, to improve its safety agenda.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    This facility is agricultural based organization which primarily engages in farming plus supplies a few neighbors with fertilizer.  One fertilizer, Anhydrous Ammonia, which is stored on our farm is used as a plant nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored 56,000 pounds which is stored in two locked tanks.  The largest tank holds 6,000 gallons and contains 28,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would occur during the unloading of a delivery tanker holding approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at eighty-five percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the point dispersion to 200 PPM is 1.1 miles.\n    B.  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident.  For our system this probably would be a release from a crack in a pump seal.  The cracked seal would permit anhydrous ammonia to be released.  "

      "SummaryText": "Though the area of the crack would be small (estimated at .007 sq. inches), the release would continue until the situation is mitigated by a manual shut-off valve.  This could take three minutes to completely mitigate.  The distance the resulting unconfined vapor travels to the point of dispersion of 200 PPM is less than 500 feet.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\n    There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injures, or significant property damage at this facility; nor that have resulted in off site deaths, injures, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n   This anhydrous ammonia facility has: (a.) a written emergency plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 1910.38, (b.) provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know-information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), and (c.) a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
