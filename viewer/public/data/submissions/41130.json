      "SummaryText": "ST Microelectronics (STM) owns and operates a semiconductor plant located in Carrollton, Texas in the northwest part of Dallas County, Texas.  The approximate location of the plant is latitude 32  56\u00bf 47\u00bfN and longitude 96  54\u00bf 59\u00bfW (co-ordinates of North East corner of property).  This executive summary has been prepared in response to the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768.155 as part of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is STM\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations to ensure that chemical safety and prevent accidental release of covered chemicals.  STM has developed a site emergency response plan, which includes hydrogen chloride spill response procedure.  The site emergency response team members (ERT) are trained per 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Chloride, listed under Section 68.130 of the 40 CFR 68 is used in the semiconductor fabs at the plant.  Presently the HCl is stored in cylinders and is present in a quantity less than the threshold limit.  In the first week of November 2004, STM will install a tube trailer and a backup storage tank for the storage of HCl at the Carrollton facility.   Since the maximum storage quantity of hydrogen chloride will exceed the threshold quantity of 5000 lbs, the HCl system will be subject to the Risk Management Program rule promulgated by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Clean Air Act.  Since hydrogen chloride is also regulated under OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the system will be subject to Program Level 3 requirements.  This RMP is being submitted prior to the date that the quantity of the regulated substance (HCl) exceeds the threshold in the process.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSTM is committed to preventing accidental release of anhydrous hydrogen chloride an"

      "SummaryText": "d complies with the OSHA PSM and RMP rule requirements.  The hydrogen chloride system is being designed and installed and will be maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations.  STM employees having duties related to the handling of anhydrous hydrogen chloride are thoroughly trained on HCl handling procedures.  Vendors who maintain the system and change out the tube trailer are also properly trained in accordance the applicable rules, codes and industry standards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.150(b)(3), the first Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the HCl system is being submitted prior to the date on which HCl will be stored at the facility above the threshold quantity.  Therefore five-year accident history for HCl in this covered process in not applicable.  There have been no accidental releases of HCl at the STM Carrollton facility in the past five years that have resulted in death, injury, or property damage on site, or known offsite impacts (deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf an accident involving anhydrous HCl were to occur, an emergency response program developed by the facility would be implemented.  The plan defines the proper procedures for the employees (specifically evacuation) and who to contact in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSTM believes that the processes storing and using anhydrous hydrogen chloride are operated and maintained in a safe manner.  However, the facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from hazard reviews.  We make changes to continuously improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry and are always looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design."
