Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Timber Hollis Fire department  and the Peoria County Emergency  Planning Coordinator, providing additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are:.  The manufacture and distribution of aluminum alkyls. We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are ethylene and ethyl chloride.  The regulated substances are used in the manufacture of aluminum alkyls.  The maximum inventory of ethylene  at our facility is  60,000lbs. while ethyl chloride  is  present at our facility in quantities up to 120,000 lbs. \n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been documented .  In addition, alternate release scenarios listed in 68.28(b)(2)(i) through v have been considered.\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention "
