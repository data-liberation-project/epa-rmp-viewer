Other safety features include ammonia sensors that sound a facility wide alarm, an emergency shutdown button that kills power to the engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and ventilation in the engine rooms to prevent ammonia explosions. \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \u00c2\u00bfStartup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used at the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. facility\u00c2\u00bfs accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (April 2005 through April 2010) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \u00c2\u00bfnear misses\u00c2\u00bf that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n1) Save lives;\n2) Minimize and avoid injuries;\n3) Protect the environment; and\n4) Minimize property damage.\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, a"
