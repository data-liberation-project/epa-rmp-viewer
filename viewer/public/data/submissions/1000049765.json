This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated whenever:\n\n?    Applicable regulations are revised;\n\n?    The plan fails in an emergency;\n\n?    In response to a facility change that materially increases the potential for fire, explosions, releases of chemicals (including hazardous wastes), or that changes the response necessary in an emergency;\n\n?    In response to recommendations arising from the Post-Incident Analysis and Critique;\n\n?    The list of Emergency Response Coordinators changes;\n\n?    The list of equipment changes.\n\n\n\nThis Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nVWR International personnel note any unusual conditions at the facility.  Any worker discovering a chemical spill will immediately notify the Emergency Response Coordinator or Spill Team Captain through the in-house phone system or pager.  All employees should escort visitors or contractors to the evacuation point and follow any instructions given by the supervisor, the Emergency Response Coordinator, or other designated internal emergency responders, and/or local government emergency responders.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the IPRP.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis performed on June 19, 2012, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the VWR International facility.
