              "Description": "Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) is manufactured in a 1-step batch process by free-radical initiated suspension polymerization of styrene.  Water is the suspension media used in the reaction.  It is pumped into any one of five (5) batch reactors (E-R-14, E-R-15, E-R-16, E-R-17, E-R-18) located in Building 4.  Liquid styrene is then pumped from on-site tank farm storage to the reactor. Free radical initiators, suspending agents, and other additives are added to the reactor. Reactor contents are heated to initiate the polymerization then cooled to control the temperature of the exothermic reaction once it has begun for the duration of the polymerization.  Asthe styrene polymerizes it forms small polystyrene beads approximately 1,000 microns in diameter.  During the styrene addition to the reactor and the polymerization reaction, the reactor vapors are vented through a condenser to a flare system.  At the conclusion of the polymerization reaction, the reactor is isolated from the flare system and liquid pentane is pumped from on-site tank farm storage into the reactor.  Pentane vaporizes in the reactor, generating pressure that causes pentane to diffuse into the polystyrene beads.  In addition, reactor temperature is increased to improve pentane diffusion and to polymerize trace amounts of remaining styrene.\nAt the conclusion of pentane diffusion, the reactor is cooled, the water/EPS bead slurry is discharged to the reactor?s given storage tank commonly called a wash tank (E-T-14, E-T-15, E-T-16, E-T-17, E-T-18) and the reactor is prepared for the next batch to be produced.  Reactors are used sequentially as batches are completed to allow as near continuous operation as possible.\nThe water/EPS bead slurry is pumped from the wash tank to one of four (4) centrifuges (E-K-08, E-K-09, E-K-10, E-K-11) where the EPS beads are separated from the water (dewatered).\nThe de-watered EPS beads are vacuum conveyed to and dried in one of four (4) drier systems (E-D-07, E-D-09, E-D-10, E-D-11).\nDried EPS beads are pressure conveyed to one of three (3) screening systems (sieves) and screened to segregate them by size.\nScreened EPS beads are pressure conveyed to packaging bins (J-BI-A, J-BI-B, J-BI-01, J-BI-02, J-BI-03, J-BI-04, J-BI-05, J-BI-06, J-BI-07, J-BI-08, J-BI-09, J-BI-10) in the packaging area.\nScreened EPS beads are mixed with liquid and/or powdered lubricating external additives and packaged for shipment to customers.\n\nEPS can also be manufactured in a 2-step process that varies from the 1-step process in that polystyrene beads previously formed and screened or micropellets (neither containing pentane) are added to a reactor with water.  The mixture is heated, pentane is added, and pentane diffusion takes place as in the 1-step process.   Processing after the reactor is the same as the 1-step process with the exception that no screening is necessary because the polystyrene beads or micropellets added to the reactor at the start of the process were previously screened or produced to the appropriate size.\n\nEach reactor is vented to the flare system through a vent condenser.  Each reactor also has an atmospheric vent that can be used during sampling reactor contents or making manual additions of chemicals to the reactor.  Each reactor has a rupture disk that vents outside the process area and an emergency discharge valve that can be used to empty reactor contents to a containment area.\nThe wash tanks are normally operated under a slight positive pressure due to a constant nitrogen purge and are vented to the flare system.  Each wash tank is also equipped with a manually activated vent to atmosphere and a manually operated drain valve.\n\nExhaust from each of the dewatering and drying systems is vented through cyclones to prevent discharge of EPS beads.\n\nWastewater that is separated from the EPS beads is discharged through a process wastewater sump to the plant?s wastewater treatment system.",

      "SummaryText": " the five-year accident history, but you are not required to do so.?\n\nThe incident being reported occurred on 9/9/08. The Facility experienced an electrical arc incident as a result of water leaking through a roof, that caused a considerable amount of damage to a motor control center (\"MCC room\") at the Facility. It is expected that a small amount of NO was released due to the arc event. The process is covered for pentane, but not for NO. In addition, the arc incident caused the loss of the Facility's flare for a period of approximately 77 hours, which resulted in a small amount of pentane being released to the atmosphere from the flare header. However, as discussed above, neither the release of pentane nor NO caused any property damage. Rather, the arc incident caused the damage which led to the release of small amounts of the chemicals noted. The amount of NO released is not known, but is assumed to be less than 1 lb, so the maximum of 1 lb was reported. The amount of pentane released was calculated from production data at 195 lbs.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program.\nThe Peru Facility has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training. The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise, the emergency response equipment is maintained, tested, and inspected periodically. The Peru Facility is actively involved with informing local stakeholders about hazardous substances stored and\nprocessed at the facility. The Peru Facility participates with the City of Peru Fire Department, the City of LaSalle Fire Department, the LaSalle County LEPC and others in assisting local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data"
