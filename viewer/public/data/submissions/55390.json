      "SummaryText": "the five-year accident history, but you are not required to do so.\u00bf\n\nThe incident being reported occurred on 9/9/08. The Facility experienced an electrical arc incident as a result of water leaking through a roof, that caused a considerable amount of damage to a motor control center (MCC room) at the Facility. It is expected that a small amount of NO was released due to the arc event. The process is covered for pentane, but not for NO. In addition, the arc incident caused the loss of the Facility's flare for a period of approximately 77 hours, which resulted in a small amount of pentane being released to the atmosphere from the flare header. However, as discussed above, neither the release of pentane nor NO caused any property damage. Rather, the arc incident caused the damage which led to the release of small amounts of the chemicals noted. The amount of NO released is not known, but is assumed to be less than 1 lb, so the maximum of 1 lb was reported. The amount of pentane released was calculated from production data at 195 lbs.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program.\nThe Peru Facility has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training. The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise, the emergency response equipment is maintained, tested, and inspected periodically. The Peru Facility is actively involved with informing local stakeholders about hazardous substances stored and\nprocessed at the facility. The Peru Facility participates with the City of Peru Fire Department, the City of LaSalle Fire Department, the LaSalle County LEPC and others in assisting local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data"
