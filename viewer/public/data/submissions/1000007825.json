This request was made in March 1997 pursuant to California health and Safety Code division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534 (b)(1) and California Code of regulations (CCR) title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). This RMP is being prepared to identify the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with the RS\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs; to record a structured assessment of hazards which may affect offsite public and environmental receptors; to provide the results of an offsite consequences analysis; to define a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs; and to establish a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements. This submission is to recertify the program at the Federal level by a 5 year update.  This program was previously certified in the State of California as part of the CalARP program in2008.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of RMCSD that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public and the environment. In order to accomplish this goal, RMCSD has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed an offsite consequences an"

      "SummaryText": "alysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.  \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nRMCSD produces, treats and distributes domestic water and provides wastewater collection and reclamation services.  Its administrative offices are located at 15160 Jackson Highway, Rancho Murieta, in Sacramento County. It operates a water treatment plant and a wastewater reclamation plant among other facilities.  The RS used at the RMCSD facilities and considered in this RMP is chlorine.  The Van Vleck Reservoir, which was considered in previous RMP\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs is no longer using gas chlorine, but uses sodium hypochlorite instead.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by RMCSD are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. \n\nChemical Specific Release Prevention Steps\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented. These include, among other things, installation of chlorine leak detectors and alarm telemetry at the sites, creating facility specific procedures for cylinder receiving, transport, hookup, and leak response; and installing seismic restraint systems for the ton containers. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chorine at RMCSD facilities in Sacramento County within the past five years which resulted in injuries or offsite effects. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRMCSD\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine consists of First Response actions related to chlorine release emergencies, notification of neighbors and notification of local emergency responders covering the geographical area where the release occurs.  In addition, for releases in excess of the Reportable Qua"

RMCSD has coordinated its emergency response program with the local agencies.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazardous analysis which RMCSD has committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  RMCSD has recently received a used chlorine scrubber from another facility.  It is in the process of evaluating the cost effectiveness of installing it at the WWRF.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
