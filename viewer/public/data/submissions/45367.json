This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery, located in Blaine, WA, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, pentane, propane and flammable mixtures. In addition, the refinery uses ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance. Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated. Hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and mercaptans do not exceed their respective T/Qs and therefore are not reported. The regulated processes consist of the following units:\n\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\n\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes. The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery. It is designed to take raw crude oil, remove salt and sediment, then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products. The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator (VDF) tower and the vacuum tower. Negative pressure, a vacuum, is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke. The Crude Unit is Program 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.\n\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\n\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit consists of two processes.

As currently designed, the unit will process straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit. The ULSD process combines hydrogen with straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces H2S, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing. The amine/H2S mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur. The unit is expected to consume 6-7 MMSCFD of 220 psig hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 ppm to less than 15 ppm.                                                                                                                                                                                     \nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Cherry Point Refinery.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in materials safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis performed at Cherry Point will be either HAZOP"

The HAZOP and What If-Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results. The PHA team consists of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise who are brought together and, through collective brainstorming, thoroughly review the hazards of the process.\n\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates ands revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely performs their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. A modern, up-to-date, fully programmable computer-driven simulator is also available for Crude Unit emplyees to practice unit operation. The simulator is fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics. The display panels, which are identical to those used in our control room are realistic. The simulator can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.
