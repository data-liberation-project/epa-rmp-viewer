This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our units.  Saddle Butte Pipeline implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The Zane unit does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel supporting the site in cooperation with local agencies are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure that would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Zane wellhead processing unit is located near Killdeer, North Dakota and is a process which receives raw natural casing gas from oil well production.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are extracted from the raw gas and stored on site.  The extracted NGLs include methane, ethane, propane, butane and a pentane natural gasoline mixture that is delivered to market via transportation vehicles.  The gas remaining after the liquids extraction it routed to the wellhead flare for destruction.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.  \n\n\nFacility Location and Driving Directions\nThe Zane facility does not have a physical location address designated by a street number, city and zip code.  Driving directions have been incorporated in this summary for clarification of facility location.  The facility can be found "

Travel 4.7 miles east on BIA 14 to the intersection with BIA 17.  From intersection of BIA 14 and BIA 17, travel south-southeast on BIA 17 for 3.9 miles.  Travel east 1.4 miles on lease access road to the Zane facility.\n\n\nHazard Assessment A? Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture that would result as a failure of a natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact.  EPAA?s RMP*CompA? was used to calculate this release scenario.  This type of scenario is unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individuals operate the subject processes.  The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\nHazard Assessment A? Alternative Release Scenario\nAn Alternative Release Scenario was not explored for this facility as it falls under a Level 1 Risk Management Plan.\n\nTraining\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented by Saddle Butte Pipeline.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to training required of all employees, personnel having specific responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are aptly trained in those procedures.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe Zane unit is a newly constructed facility.  As such, there have been no relea"

      "SummaryText": "ses of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nSaddle Butte Pipeline has written emergency response procedures to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response including response to a regulated substance release including the possibility of a fire or explosion in the event that a flammable substance is accidently released.  Procedures also address evacuation, accounting for personnel and company and agency notification.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or facility. The overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders including local law enforcement and the Dunn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSaddle Butte Pipeline personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of itA?s equipment and operations.  This is done through training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date information available.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.\n"
