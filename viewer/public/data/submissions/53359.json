There are no toxic substances stored in quantities above the RMP thresholds listed in 40 CFR Part 68 , thus toxic WCS and ARS modeling is not required. The flammable WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified.  Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the flammable ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\n\nThe following are summaries of the flammable WCS and ARS modeling at NCP ? West Site.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 1.07 off-site consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors, and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS LandView? VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur.  These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n-  Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\n-  Routine surveillance by trained operators;\n-  Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\n-  Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\n\n1. Flammable Worst-Case Release Scenario ? Butylene\n\nThe WCS for a flammable release assumes the catastrophic failure, instantaneous release, and vapor cloud explosion of 11,692,800 lbs of butylene.

The WCS assumes that if one of the storage vessels catastrophically fails then it is likely that the structural integrity of the other sphere will also be compromised.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to structural and natural obstacles between the sphere and off-site receptors.  No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release calculation.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 1.8 miles (9,504 ft).  A population estimate of 3,588 people off-site, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted.\n\n2. Flammable Alternative Release Scenario ? Butylene\n\nThe ARS for this facility assumes a ?? leak in an elbow in the 14? line to the feed pumps between one of the two butylene storage spheres and the first isolation valve.  A release of butylene and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion occurs as a result of this equipment malfunction.  Although the mixture is liquefied under pressure in this line, modeling was conducted based on a gas release because it produced a longer distance to endpoint and was a more conservative approach.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to structural and natural obstacles between the sphere and off-site receptors.  No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release calculation.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.2 miles (1,056 ft).  A population estimate of 32 people off-site could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified."
