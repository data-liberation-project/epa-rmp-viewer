Introduction:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen facility in North Bend, OH\n\npurchases anhydrous ammonia and brings it into the plant by\n\nbarge line and rail car.  Ammonia is burned over precious\n\nmetal gauze and converted into nitric acid.  Additional\n\nammonia is reacted with nitric acid to make ammonium\n\nnitrate. The urea is brought in by truck or rail car and\n\nblended with ammonium nitrate to make a solution of urea and\n\nammonium nitrate with 28% total nitrogen.  The facility has\n\nstorage and shipping capability for all of its final\n\nproducts.  Sales from this facility are from nitric acid,\n\nanhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and\n\nfertilizer solutions, which are mixtures of ammonium nitrate\n\nand urea.\n\n\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen North Bend facility has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto plant personnel or contractors since it was constructed\n\nin 1965.   In addition, the plant has operated without a\n\nlost time accident for over 16 years, and over 1,228,000 man-\n\nhours. There have been no RMP reportable releases of toxic\n\nchemicals in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\n\n\nAs part of the management system for Process Safety\n\nManagement, a plant wide computer system is utilized which\n\nincorporates maintenance and process safety. Computers\n\nlocated in strategic locations are used to access plant\n\nfiles for P&ID drawings, operating procedures, Management of\n\nChange (MOC) documents, and other pertinent documents.  This\n\nsystem is used to provide our employees with the necessary\n\ntools and records for process safety requirements.  It plays\n\nan integral part in the safety efforts of this plant.\n\n\n\nIn addition, plant personnel and full time contractor\n\npersonnel routinely participate in monthly "

EPA makes this statement about\n\nworst case scenarios:\n\n\n\n     \"Because the assumptions required for the worst -case\n\n     analysis are very conservative, the results likely will\n\n     be very conservative.
