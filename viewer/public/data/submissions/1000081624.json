Atkinson, WI facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    OSI's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?    Hazard Assessment;\n\n?

OSI's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at OSI; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. OSI is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is OSI policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and v"

Facility Identification\n\nThe OSI facility is located at 1200 Industrial Drive in Ft. Atkinson, Wisconsin. The facility processes ground beef specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311991.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\n\n\nOSI Ft. Atkinson is a food processing facility that runs a continuous operation. OSI utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration. Two closed loop refrigeration systems are required to freeze and cool the raw material and product and maintain the facility's temperature. OSI has a total of 69,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite. System 1 contains 37,000 pounds and System 2 contains 32,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document OSI is continuously improving this program. \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.

The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - OSI has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - OSI maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - OSI has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. OSI completed a thorough PHA revalidation study for the ammonia refrigeration systems on June 12, 2015.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - OSI has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.    \n\n?    Training - OSI has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n?

Pre-Startup Review - OSI has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity - OSI has updated a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  \n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - OSI has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between OSI and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?    Incident Investigation - OSI has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n?

Management Program\n\nOSI has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals are to be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.
