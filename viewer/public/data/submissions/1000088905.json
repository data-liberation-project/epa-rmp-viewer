Shelter in place involves everyone in the affected area seeking shelter indoors, shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning and other ventilation systems.\n\nCHS operates over 70 storage sites across the country. In the past five years we have had very few releases from fixed storage facilities. Vandalism and theft from nurse tanks has accounted for the some of our releases.\n\nOur employees are trained in the characteristics and proper handling procedures for anhydrous ammonia.\nThey are equipped with the proper personal protective equipment for routine handling of the product. The training also covers the basics in responding to emergencies involving ammonia releases and is available to assist the community first responders with technical information and advice.\n\nCHS provide training, training material and emergency response information to each fire department with jurisdiction over our locations. We also meet with concerned citizens and other interested parties about our risk management program and anhydrous ammonia safety in general.\n\nCHS continually updates the training provided to its employees. Employees are trained in proper handling, facility inspections, ammonia characteristics; emergency procedures and must review the emergency response plan, emergency action plan, and site security plan annually.\n\nCHS is proud of its past safety performance and is continuing to look for new ways to improve its anhydrous ammonia safety program."

The company stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia in pressure vessels.\n\nCHS believes that the health, safety, and preservation of our environment are critical components of effective management and business success. As a company, we are committed to:\n-Providing a secure and health conscious work environment for employees and visitors\n-Conducting our business with always having value for the communities in which we operate and in the spirit of a good neighbor\n-Meeting or exceeding the requirements of the environmental, health, & safety laws and regulations\n-Training employees on the environmental, health & safety requirements of their jobs\n-Working with government and other stakeholders to identify and solve problems\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in pressure vessels on properties. It is transferred into the vessel from either semi-transports or rail cars and then placed into application equipment or nurse tanks. The application equipment and/or nurse tanks are then transported to the farmer's field where the anhydrous ammonia is injected into the soil.\n\nAn anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety relief valves that are designed to release pressure in the event the tank becomes over pressurized. The tanks are also equipped with excessive flow valves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release should happen. \n\nWe have used RMP Comp to calculate the area that would be impacted by a worst case scenario release and an alternative case scenario release.    RMP Comp is supplied to us by the EPA. It tends to over exaggerate the plume, which in turn adds a good safety factor into the\nplanning process. Our written programs are continually updated and are available for review at the ammonia storage locations.\n\nIn the event of a release from a storage facility that could impact the community, we advise those in t"
