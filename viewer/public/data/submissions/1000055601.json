All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\n\nThe facility utilizes the What-If/What-If Checklist Combined PHA methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards:  toxic release, fire, explosion, over-pressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure. The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, excess flow devices and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases. The facility also utilizes dike containment around the facility's storage tanks, including the denaturant storage tank, to contain and mitigate liquid releases.\n\nFHR Iowa Falls keeps a variety of technical documents onsite that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility and provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nFHR Iowa Falls is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the PSM. The operating procedures that have been developed have been prepared as a guide for those involved with initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown of the process.

Prior to awarding contracts, the FHR representative evaluates the prior safety performance of any prospective contractor. After the contractor has been selected, the FHR Iowa Falls representative conducts a contractor orientation meeting with the contract employer representative. At that time, FHR reviews known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards that are related to the contractor's work and the covered process. The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan, conditions regarding entrance to the process and the applicable safe work practices that must be followed in order to work at the site. Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nAs part of the management of change (MOC) process, whenever a modification to the existing process is planned, either temporary or permanent, FHR Iowa Falls requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). The PSSR confirms that, prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications. The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed. A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program was developed as part of PSM that defines "
