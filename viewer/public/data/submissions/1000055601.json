Prior to awarding contracts, the FHR representative evaluates the prior safety performance of any prospective contractor. After the contractor has been selected, the FHR Iowa Falls representative conducts a contractor orientation meeting with the contract employer representative. At that time, FHR reviews known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards that are related to the contractor's work and the covered process. The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan, conditions regarding entrance to the process and the applicable safe work practices that must be followed in order to work at the site. Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\nAs part of the management of change (MOC) process, whenever a modification to the existing process is planned, either temporary or permanent, FHR Iowa Falls requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). The PSSR confirms that, prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications. The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed. A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program was developed as part of PSM that defines"
