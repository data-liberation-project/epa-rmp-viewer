The plan conforms to the Draft Guidance Document for the California Consolidated Contingency Plan published by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services and is modeled after the National Reponse Team's Integrated Plan, the One Plan. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has delegated implementation authority for this federal program to the California Office of Emergency Services (OES). At the local level, the program is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA). For facilities operating within the City of Tulare, the CUPA is the Tulare County Environmental Health Department.\n\nThe Land O' Lakes Tulare, Ca. facilities consist of a creamery, engaged in the production of dairy products such as powered milk, cheese and butter from raw milk.
