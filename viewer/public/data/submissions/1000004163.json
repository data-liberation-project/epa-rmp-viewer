At the local level, the program is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA). For facilities operating within the City of Tulare, the CUPA is the Tulare County Environmental Health Department.\n\nThe Land O' Lakes Tulare, Ca. facilities consist of a creamery, engaged in the production of dairy products such as powered milk, cheese and butter from raw milk. Five (5) separate dairy processing facilities presently exist.\n                           \nAnhydrous ammonia, a regulated chemical is present above threshold quantities at the Land O' Lakes Tulare, Ca. facility. There are three individually covered anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes with a total inventory of 40,327 pounds present on-site. The plant 1 & 2 main refrigeration system is the largest process at the facility and contains the bulk of the anhydrous ammonia enventory at 35,821 pounds. The Plant's 3 and 4 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration processes are stand alone systems and both combined contain less than the EPA's threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia. Although the Plant 1 & 2 anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is the only process present above the EPA threshold quantity, the facility has choosen to designate all Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration systems located at the facility as Program Level 3 processes and subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemiclas Standa"

A preventive maintenance check for inspection has been developed.  Piping and Instrument Drawings (P&IDA?s) of the system including safety devices such as relief valve locations are mapped out in the facilities command center.  \n\nSafe Distance and Safe Places of Refuge;\n\nSafe distances will be determined by using the DOT Emergency Response Guidebook.  Prevailing winds are determined by wind-socks located at the top of designated silos.  Places of refuge are determined at the time of the incident based on traffic, time of day, Plant involved, wind direction and other dangers.  \n\nSite Security and Control;\n\nUpon arrival at the site of the release, the incident commander will assure that all individuals needing first aid are attended to, and steps are taken to control the general public from exposure to the release.
