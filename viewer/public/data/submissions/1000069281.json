This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the polyurethane foam manufacturing system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Carpenter Co. - Riverside facility maintains and operates a process system comprised of Methyl Formate and Toluene Diisocyanate, 80:20 TDI blend (80 wt% 2,4 TDI and 20 wt% 2,6 TDI) hereby referred to as TDI. Not including unloading of the regulated chemicals Methyl Formate and TDI to their respective storage tanks,there is one process these regulated chemical are involved in.\n\n\n\nPolyurethane Foam Manufacturing Process: Equipment for the regulated substances involved in the manufacturing of polyurethane foam include: four 55,000 gallon TDI storage tanks, two 12,500 gallon TDI metering tanks, one 10,000 gallon Methyl Formate storage tank, one Methyl Formate booster pump, one Methyl Formate pump metering skid, two heat exchangers, and multiple TDI transfer pumps. Both Methyl Formate and TDI are individually piped and do not come into contact with one another until they meet at the mixing head where the foam is poured. Additionally, there can be up to four approximately 23,700 gallon (each) TDI railcars stored onsite. Details of the inventory calculation can be found in the Process Safety Information (PSI) section of the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA RMP/CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the regulated toxic chemical involved in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process (TDI).

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nAlthough both the handling of Methyl Formate and TDI and the production of polyurethane foam have inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a Methyl Formate and/or TDI release. The facility utilizes pressure relief valves, manual and automated shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of the Prevention Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of Methyl Formate and TDI. Prevention elements for each program are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\nList of Prevention Program Elements:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n- Incident Investiga"
