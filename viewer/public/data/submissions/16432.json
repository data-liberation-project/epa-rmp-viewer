The plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans, and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a hazardous material spill, protect the well-being of Rohm and Haas employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the plant response plan have been provided to the Philadelphia Fire Department, the local hospital, the PLEPC, and the State and Federal Environmental Protection Agencies.  \n\nA trained on-site incident commander is assigned the responsibility of coordinating the Plant response to any incident which may occur.  An incident commander is on duty at the Plant 24 hours per day.   Additionally, a trained Communication Coordinator is assigned the responsibility of setting up the emergency operations center, communicating response needs with outside responders, contacting outside agencies, and activating both the Community Sirens and the Community Alert Network (CAN System) to alert and inform residents.

EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning. Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, these worse-case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS). Unlike worst case scenarios, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.   According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning. \n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one WCS based on the RMP definition. \n\nRMP Defined Worst Case Scenario\nThis scenario involves Oleum, which is considered a toxic material under the RMP rule.   It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of a 187,500 pound railcar inside the Containment Shed over a ten minute period.  This scenario takes the following passive mitigation systems into account:  the containment shed as an enclosure, a below-grade sump which will contain 75% of the railcar, natural berms outside of the shed and drains to the chemical sewer outside of the shed.  These passive mitigation systems would all act to reduce aspill pool area such that the vaporization rate to the atmosphere would be significantly reduced.  The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint of this release, and such a release could have a significant off-site impact.  Because of the plant controls, procedures and training, this worse case event is considered extremely unlikely. \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Rohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified two Alternate Release Scenarios: one for each toxic m"

The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate worst case and alternate case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.

These scenarios were chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenarios we have identified are more credible than those described in the worst case, but are still very unlikely given the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training.  The following provide descriptions of our alternate case scenarios.  \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Oleum (Toxic Liquid)\nIf a rupture occurred in the 2 transfer line from the railcar to the process reactor, 3,800 pounds of Oleum would be released inside the production building.  It is assumed that the release would be either physically detected by an operator (there is a continuous operator presence in the production building) or detected by the control system, and stopped within 10 minutes.   The PHAST model was used to determine the toxic endpoint.  This release could affect plant employees, and the employees of the Frankford Arsenal to the north, depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction. There are no residences or environmental receptors within the alternate release toxic endpoint circle.  \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Nitric Acid (Toxic Liquid)\nIf a rupture occurred in the 1-1/2 transfer line from the tank truck to the storage tank, 6,300 lbs of 90% Nitric Acid would be released outside.  The tank truck unloading operation is constantly attended by an operator per DOT regulations.  It is assumed that the release would be physically detected by the operator and stopped within 10 minutes.  The release would be contained in a sloped and diked area as the tank truck, storage tank and piping are all within a diked area.  This containment would reduce the pool area, thereby reducing the nitric acid vaporization rate.  The unloading area is equipped with a deluge system and a remote fire monitor nozzle to assist with mitigation. The PHAST model was used to determin"

The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents:  \n\n1)  Employee Participation \u0016 Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.  Employees participate in safety committees, job safety analysis, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.\n\n2)  Process Hazard Analysis - Various process hazard analysis techniques are used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses and updated a minimum of every five years. Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  Examples include:\n \n-  Redundant safety systems and instrumentation\n-  Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n-  Secondary containment for storage tanks\n-  Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n-  Pressure relief devices to prevent overpressurization\n-  Fire protection systems\n-  Operator surveillance of unloading operations\n-  Permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n-  Work preplanning and safety reviews\n\n3)  Operating Procedures \u0016 Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to ensure safe operation.
