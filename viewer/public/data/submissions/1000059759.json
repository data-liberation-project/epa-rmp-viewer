Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Silver Creek Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68  Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant employs twelve (12) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, LP (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, submitted the most recent RMP 5-year update for the Silver Creek Plant to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in September 2011.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.  \n\n\n\nACC"

      "SummaryText": "IDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a NGL release.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant processes NGL in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves. NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum volume of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 85,857 gallons (336,755 pounds). The largest NGL tank is 54,068 gallons (212,070 pounds).  Natural gas condensate is also stored at the Facility.  Although the MSDS for this product does not list it as having RMP-regulated components, the composition of natural gas condensate is variable and may at times contain up to 40 percent pentane.  The facility has chosen to consider the natural gas condensate as an RMP-regulated material.  The maximum volume of natural gas condensate at the Facility at any given time is 56,089 gallons (374,463 pounds).  The largest natural gas condensate tank is 53,084 gallons (354,402 pounds).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL and natural gas condensate. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the Prevention Program required under OSHA's PSM. The Silver Creek Plant's "

Further safety information is also detailed in the EP&RP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Parker County Sheriff's Department. The Parker County Sheriff's Department is designated as the First Responder in the event of NGL release.  For these reasons, the Silver Creek Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\n\n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility.
