We are developing and implementing a combination of an accidental release prevention program and an emergency action plan to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we are implementing, including:\n\n  *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management plan (RMP) regulation.\n  *  An overview of our accidental release prevention program.\n  *  A five-year accident history for accidental release of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP Rule.\n  *  An overview of our emergency action plan.\n  *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from\n     occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n2.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Trenton Municipal Utilities water supply and treatment facilities provide safe, reliable, and economical drinking\nwater within the City of Trenton and also to Grundy County Public Water Supply District No. 1 and to Sullivan County\nPublic Water Supply District No. 1.  In our water treatment plant process, we use the following chemical the EPA has\nidentified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental\nrelease:\n\nToxics:  Chlorine\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant to inactivate disease causing organisms and to maintain high quality potable water\nduring distribution.  The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at the water treatment plant site is 6,000 pounds.\n\nFl"

The prevention\nprogram in place includes:\n\n1.  Regular review of safety information such as Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), routine documentation of\n     chlorine inventory, and regular updating of safety information to assure accuracy and completeness.\n2.  Hazard review of the chlorination system using industry recommended checklists to assess potential problems\n     that could result in an accidental release, determine the safeguards needed to control hazards, or prevent\n     equipment malfunction.\n3.  Written operating procedures that address initial startup, normal operations, termporary operations, emergency\n     shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or emergency shutdown or a\n     major change, consequences of deviations and steps required to correct or avoid deviations, and routine\n     equipment inspections.\n4.  Regular employee training to assure that each plant operator has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to\n     safely carry out the duties and responsibilities assigned.\n5.  Written maintenance procedures and documentation to assure safe operation of critical equipment.  Operators\n     routinely review these procedures prior"

If an accidental release occurs, \nwe are prepared to conduct a formal accident investigation to identify and correct the root cause of such an event.\n\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nOur employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  Instead, our facility is included in\nthe community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to Know\nAct (EPCRA), and we maintain an emergency action plan that is coordinated with the Trenton Fire Department for\nemergency response actions.
