Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Ashland Inc., facility in Elkton, Maryland contains one RMP covered process which is the vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing plant.  The plant must maintain greater than 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl acetate emulsions.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations as well as our own strict environmental, health, and safety standards.  Ashland manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire department so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nAshland is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Ashland is a member of the American Chemical Council and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The Elkton facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as the Cecil County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and a Community Advisory Panel.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Manage"

The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing facility is located at 329 West Main Street in Elkton, Maryland.  To produce polyvinyl acetate emulsions, liquid vinyl acetate monomer is polymerized in reactors to form polyvinyl acetate emulsions.  The polyvinyl acetate emulsion is a non-hazardous, water based liquid.  The polyvinyl acetate emulsion is then shipped by railcars, bulk trucks, totes and drums to industrial customers for the production of paint products, paper coatings and adhesives.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is the liquid vinyl acetate monomer.  Approximately 636,000 pounds of liquid vinyl acetate monomer is present on site in the storage tanks, piping and processing.  An average of 975,000 pounds of liquid vinyl acetate monomer is also present in railcars on site in order to maintain efficient and continuous production. \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  Ashland manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations.\n\nOur facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, fail-safe valves and dikes for the unlikely case of a potential leak.  Systems and equipment are designed to engineering standards and codes.  Safety reviews are conducted prior to all projects and changes.\n\nOur plant is operated safely by trained and certified operators who follow well maintained standard operating procedures with defined safe"

Investigations are conducted for all incidents to prevent recurrence.\n\nWe maintain operational safety through preventative maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  We hold contractors to the same high safety training standards as our employees.  We implement proactive task observation and accident prevention techniques on jobs.\n\nWe routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state and local regulations.  We also have a comprehensive program to audit the plant\u00c2\u00bfs performance against corporate environmental and safety standards.  Management reviews and drives to resolution all audit findings.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases involving vinyl acetate monomer at the Elkton Plant in the last five years that have had an adverse impact on the community.  There have been no incidents at the facility that meet the EPA Risk Management Program reporting requirements.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Cecil County LEPC and City Fire Departments for awareness on potential hazards and locations of materials at the site.  Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
