Our worst case scenario would be the failure of one 30,000 storage tank filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F) Resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.The resulting distance to the endpoint does extend offsite, and public receptors are within the distance.Our alternative release scenario is a break in a pipe at our bulk plant leading to a 10 minute release and resulting explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offiste, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. The facility complies with EPA's accidnet prevention requirements. This facility also complies with applicable state, federal and local codes.\n\n\nFive Year accident history.
