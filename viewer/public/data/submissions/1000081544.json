The accidental release prevention policy at the Greenville Sanitary Authority's Borough of Greenville treatment facility involves a combined effort between management, operating and local emergency personnel.  The facility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards, review safety techniques, and implement employee training through operation, maintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk of a chlorine gas release.\r\n\r\nB. The Greenville Sanitary Authority's Borough of Greenville treatment facility was originally placed into operation in 1956.  The facility was expanded in 1994.  The facility currently has the capacity of treating 11.25 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous chlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect the effluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount of chlorine handled is three one-ton containers for a total of 6,000 pounds.  The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted and are designed for conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is inspected daily by the wastewater treatment plant operating personnel.  The facility is manned approximately 8 hours per day.\r\n\r\nC. In general, the Borough of Greenville Treatment Facility's accidental release prevention program is based on the following:\r\n\r\n- Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\r\n- Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\r\n- Preparation of written operating procedures for safely conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\r\n- Implementation of employee training program\r\n- Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\r\n\r\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Greenville Sanitary Authority will perform a compliance audit at least once every 3 years.

Written documentation of the audit will be maintained on-site.\r\n\r\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A summary of the investigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained at the treatment facility.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the appropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection device, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and a ton-cylinder repair kit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees relative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine gas.\r\n\r\nD. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nE. The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Mercer CountyA\u00bfs written emergency response plan.  Release response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation procedures and training exercises are included within the plan.  The public is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as soon as a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within the plan.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility emergency coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe Borough of Greenville WWTP employees will not respond to accidental releases of chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include the local fire department, police department, emergency medical service and HAZMAT team.\r\n\r\nF. There are no actions planned to improve safety regarding the chlorine system at this time."
