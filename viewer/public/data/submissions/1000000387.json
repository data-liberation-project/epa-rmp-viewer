The purpose of this document is to present a single RMP to comply with the federal and state regulations.\n\n1.9 Facility Description\n\nUrethane Polymers International, Inc. (UPI) operates primarily as a manufacturer of waterproofing compounds.  The Fontana, California facility is located at 10880 Poplar Avenue in Fontana, California.  The Fontana facility produces elastomeric polyurethane deck coating systems that are durable, skid resistant surface protection coatings.  The coatings are produced via a low-temperature (approximately 130\u00b0F) polymerization of proprietary formulations with the two diisocyanate chemicals of interest in small batch reactors.  There are four reactors ranging in size from four (4) to eighteen (18) barrels at the facility.  Some of these products are shipped directly to customers in containers; others are used in-house as base materials for further product manufacturing.  Supporting operations include shipping docks, drum storage areas, storage tanks, concrete storage vault for TDI and IPDI, compressed air and other utilities, technical service, quality-control laboratory, and administrative offices.\nTwo (2) of the chemicals used in the production process, toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (an 80%/20% blend of the 2,4- and 2,6- isomers) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) are used/stored at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the RMP requirements of \u00a740 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.\n\n1.10\tCompany Registration Information\n\nThe UPI company registration information is provided below:\n\nFacility Name: UPI Sealant Products\nSource Identification: Urethane Polymers International, Inc.\nEPA Identification Number: 100000084491\nFacility Dunn & Bradstreet Number: 363212036\nStreet Address:\t10880 Poplar Avenue\nCity: Fontana\nState: California\nZip Code: 92337\nCounty:\tSan Bernardino\nFacility Latitude: +34\u00b0 03? 26?\nFacility L"

      "SummaryText": "ls, the worst-case release is an offloading and pallet transfer accident.\nThis worst-case scenario is a very unlikely scenario for two reasons:  \n\n? All resin drums are U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved drums and are designed to accept significant damage without failing.  \n? The OCA assumed conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the worst-case scenario conditions required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for an RMP worst-case analysis.  However, stability conditions of F only occur at night but deliveries of these materials normally occur during the day.   \n\nA two-step approach was used in the performance of the worst-case off-site consequence analysis.  First, the RMP*Comp? model was used to estimate the emission rate associated with the complete rupture and unconfined spread of four drums of TDI or IPDI.  Second, these emission rates were input to the SCREEN3 model for estimating the expected concentrations of TDI and IPDI as a function of downwind distance.  The SCREEN3 model approximated the unconfined spill as a ground level area source with an area equal to the surface area of a 220 gallon spill spreading to a thickness of one centimeter.\nThe model computed a TDI emission rate of 0.0074 pounds per minute for this worst-case scenario.  The emission rate for IPDI was estimated to be 0.0037 pounds per minute.  The RMP program toxic threshold for TDI is 0.007 mg/L (7,000 \u00b5g/m3) while that for IPDI is 0.0012 mg/L (1,200 \u00b5g/m3).  Based on the results from the SCREEN3 model, the airborne concentration of TDI never reaches the significant impact level (endpoint distance) for the worst-case scenario.  The maximum concentrations for TDI and IPDI (2,000 \u00b5g/m3 and 130 \u00b5g/m3) occur at approximately 65 feet downwind of the spill location.  The closest distance to the property line from a potential spill location is 120 feet.  \nSince the facility meets the requirements of a Program 1 facility, modeling of an alternate release scenario is"

Creation and deployment of spill kits throughout the work area to allow rapid containment and minimization of area affected by the spill.\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility operations are being reviewed by UPI to see if there are operational procedures or physical improvements that can be made to improve safety.  Two recommendations are made:\n\n1. UPI should require its supplier to restrict the contents of the delivery truck to only TDI and/or IPDI when delivering these materials to UPI.  This restriction would minimize the potential for incompatible substances to be in the delivery truck at one time, and hence reduce the potential of a vehicle or loading accident involving incompatible chemicals.\n\n2. UPI should formalize a succession plan for the plant supervisor.  He is a critical person supervising all activities involving TDI and IPDI and the training for his replacement should be formalized.\n\n1.8 Purpose\n\nUnder the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) requires the owner or operator of a covered stationary source with regulated chemicals exceeding the threshold quantity to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to protect the general public and environment from accidental releases.  In California, Senate Bill 1889 requires California to implement the federally mandated Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Effective January 1, 1997, the new California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) replaced the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).

These raw materials are received at the UPI loading dock via trucks in 55-gallon drums.  Up to 72 drums of TDI may be received at one time, and up to 40 durms of IPDI may be received at one time.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored on-site is 80 drums and the maximum quantity of IPDI stored on-ste is 40 drums.\n\nThe TDI and IPDI drums are transferred from the loading dock area via forklift to a dedicated temperature-controlled storage room.  The drums remain in the storage room until needed for production.  Ingredients required for production (including polyols, colorants, filters, curing modifiers, thinners) are placed first into the reactor vessel with a vacuum drawn.  The reactor is heated to 220 degrees Faherheit to remove moisture and degas the batch.  The TDI (and IPDI) drums remain at room temperature at all times; only one drum at a time is transferred by forklift from the storage room to the reactor room.  One single drum is connected to the reactor by a valve and 8-foot length of flexible 2-inch hose. \n\nUpon opening the valve, the reactor vacuum draws TDI (or IPDI) into the reactor.  The transfer time for a drum is approximately 3 minutes.  Upon entry into the reactor, the TDI (or IPDI) reacts with the polyol in an exothermic reaction, raising the temperature of the batch within the reactor.  A water cooling jacket around the vessel cools the reactor to maintain the process temperature. When the specified quantity of TDI and/or IPDI has been transferred, the flow is stopped by closing the transfer valve.  If an emergency shut-down is required during the process, the labeled off switch can be switched and the transfer valve can be closed to stop additional TDI or IPDI from being transferred.  After all the required TDI and/or IPDI is transferred and blending is complete, the finished product is allowed"

For TDI, the RMP TQ is 10,000 pounds and the CalARP TQ is 500 pounds for the 2,4- isomer and 100 pounds for the 2,6- isomer.  The CalARP TQ for IPDI is 100 pounds.  Neither of these chemicals is regulated by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).\n\nThe UPI facility stores the drums of TDI and IPDI in a segregated storage area.  Both the RMP and CalARP regulations define the storage of separate drums in a common storage area as a single process.  The facility is planning to store up to 80x55-gallon drums of TDI on-site at one time and up to 40x55-gallon drums of IPDI on-site at one time.  Therefore, the maximum inventory consists of approximately 44,000 pounds of TDI and 18,000 pounds of IPDI.  The maximum TDI content at UPI is above the RMP TQ and is also above the CalARP TQ.  The maximum IPDI content at UPI is above the CalARP TQ.  Therefore, UPI is subject to both the California CalARP program and to the Federal RMP program.\n\nThe major hazards represented by the process are the release of toxic substances (TDI and IPDI) due to spills and mixing vessel rupture.  Transportation or storage accidents involving these chemicals are the scenarios that would produce the largest spill and potential release of regulated substances. \n\nThe UPI facility is subject to the RMP and CalARP Level 1 program requirements because it meets the three requirements for applicability of the Level 1 programs:\n\n- There have been no reportable accidental releases of a regulated substance in the past five years for which there has been an off-site significant impact;\n- The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case accidental release does not extend off-site, and\n-Emergency response procedures at the UPI facility will be coordinated with the local emergency planning a"

Once cool, the product is removed from the reactor and placed into containers for storage and future shipment.\n\n1.2.3  Process Flow Diagram\n\nA simplified process flow diagram for the UPI facility for the TDI and IPDI processes is givin in Figure 1.  According to the CalARP definitions, the processes at the UPI facility are receiving, storage, and the reaction system.\n\n1.3\tWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n1.3.1\tWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario analyzed in the Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) is a pallet of four (4) drums being dropped while transported via forklift and the drums rupturing.  The resulting spill is assumed to be unconfined with no passive mitigation measures in place.   The liquid pool is assumed to spread to a thickness of 1 cm.  The TDI is assumed to be at ambient temperature (70\u00b0F).\n\nAn alternative worst-case release examined is a reactor accident.  This scenario was reviewed and found to pose a lower risk than the transport accident scenario.  In the reactor, the TDI and IPDI reaction with the polyol is very rapid with polymerization occurring throughout the batch, such that free (i.e., non polymerized) TDI or IPDI is no longer available very soon after entering the batch.  Transfer of the TDI or IPDI into the reactor ends the presence of free TDI or IPDI due to the rapid polymerization reaction.  The potential danger of a large uncontrolled TDI or IPDI spill during transfer into the reactor is negligible since the transfer is by vacuum, not a pump, and is through a 2-inch hose.  The rate of flow is governed by the vacuum and if a vacuum is lost (e.g. a leak in the reactor), the transfer of raw TDI or IPDI will cease.  The most likely reactor room spill scenario would involve a rupture of a single drum by a fork lift accident or a separation of the transfer hose.  As this scenario would release a lower quantity of room temperature TDI or IDPI than a pallet transfer accident involving four barre"
