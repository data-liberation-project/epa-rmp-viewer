The location of Unicold's other storage facilities (Seattle, Oakland, and Los Angeles) allow easy shipment of products to Hawaii.  As stated on the company's website, \"Unicold Corporation employs skillfully trained professionals to better serve you.  Our staff is familiar with all phases of order flow and service requirements.  We also have the largest refrigerated food warehouse in the islands located near the Honolulu International Airport.  We have all the facilities, manpower, and expertise to assure your refrigerated shipments are well taken care of.  After all, who else can keep Hawaii zero degrees all year round?\"\n\n\n\nUnicold Corporation's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Unicold has an Emergency Action Plan in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Procedures Manual maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.    This Plan is reviewed and updated regularly to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Unicold Corporation was built in 1965.  The facility is located at 3140 Ualena Street, Honolulu, Hawaii.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The ammonia refrigeration system uses 14,313 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, free"

      "SummaryText": "zer storage, and food processing equipment.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors is located in two engine rooms plus an additional small pump room.  The condensers are mounted on the main engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Unicold Corporation facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in 1965 in accordance with the appropriate building and fire codes. The Unicold Corporation ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the Unicold Corporation operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia sensors that sounds a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that kills power to the engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation in the main engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on industry guidelines and standards as well as facility operating history. The preventative maintenance is primarily handled by in-house refrigeration technicians; however, a professional refrigeration contractor is available on call to attend to any repairs. Unicold's ammonia mechanics and engineers are well experienced and trained. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (68.42(a)); or Known offsite deaths, injuries,"

      "SummaryText": " property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nA well-planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release. Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings. To this end, Unicold Corporation has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Honolulu Fire Department and has instructed their employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release. Unicold Corporation maintains a well-trained emergency response team and has a written emergency response plan which specifies the details of the actions that will be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Unicold Corporation safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n\n\n"
