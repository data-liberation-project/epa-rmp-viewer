If an accidental release should occur, the facitilty is prepared to work with the local fire department, Taylor County LEPC, and /or any other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\nThis facility is a retail Farm Supply Distribution Center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anyhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved by truck, handled and stored on site.  It is a regulated substance by EPA requiring us to xomply with the risk management program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nThis facility maintains nurse tanks for the customer delivery. See RMP for our combined capacity in nurse tanks.  Anydrous ammonia is stored in stationary storage tanks on site. See RMP for the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage.See RMP for the total capacity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored on the site.  See RMP for the largest single storage vessel at our facility.\n\nThe general release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  The facility complies with the NSI K61.1 standards EPA's accidental release prevention rule, IA Fertilizer Law Part 21 Chapter 43 Rule 43.6 (200) as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  Our ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut offs and emergency shut off valves.  The load out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and the fill l"

All of the main storage tank vbalves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local communtiy fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.l  In prepartation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that our community has the stategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirements for our facility to be included in the communtiy emergency response plan prepared under EPRCA and coordinated with our LEPC. In addition, Taygold Cooperarive has an emergency repsonse and contigency plan for each faacility that complies with the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nWe do not paln to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to  provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures and provide regualr inspection asnd maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
