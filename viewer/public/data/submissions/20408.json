Anhydrous ammonia is regulated under U.S. EPA's Accident Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68). Because anhydrous ammonia will be present in the SCR process in quantities well in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold, the SCR process is subject to ARP regulations. \n\nThe Homer City generating station already utilizes relatively small quantities of anhydrous ammonia in the electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to enhance the control of particulate matter. However, because 1) less than 10,000 lbs. of ammonia is present in the ESP process at any time, 2) the ESP process is not connected to the SCR process, and 3) ESP ammonia storage is separated from SCR storage by nearly 500 ft, the ESP process is not subject to the risk management regulation.  Even though it is not subject to regulation, EME Homer City Generation L. P. has taken steps to ensure the safe handling and use of ammonia in the ESP area.\n   \nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas which is readily detectable by its extremely pungent odor.  In sufficient concentrations, anhydrous ammonia is an eye, skin, and/or inhalation irritant.  For this reason, anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard at 29 CFR Part 1910.119 and the U.S. EPA risk management rule at 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nFor ammonia processes, the threshold quantity for coverage under 40 CFR Part 68 is 10,000 lbs.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored above-ground in three horizontally oriented cylindrical pressure vessels, with a combined storage capacity of  663,000 lbs.  Shipping and transfer of ammonia to the pressure vessels is carried out by trained qualified personnel provided by the vendor, using standard operating procedures that have been thoroughly reviewed for safety.  The unloading process is monitored from the boiler control rooms an"

The procedures minimize routine release of residual ammonia in the transfer hose by purging ammonia from the transfer hose back into the transport trailer. Ammonia is pumped from the storage area to the SCR area where it is vaporized, mixed with heated air and injected into the flue gas, which is then immediately passed through a catalyst material.  The reaction in the presence of the catalyst reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) mixture to nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O) .  \n\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the RMPlan submittal date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals).  Given that the SCR process contains substantial quantities of ammonia that if released could affect public receptors, it does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to processes, such as those present at the Homer City facility, that are subject to the OSHA PSM. Because the accident prevention elements of Program 3 are virtually identical to PSM, compliance with U.S. EPA Risk Management regulations also constitute compliance with PSM. \n\n3.0   RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate RMPlans, the U.S. EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be utilized as administrative guides for planning purposes.

For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-case defined by the U.S. EPA methods and an alternative case, which is considered by EME Homer City Generation L. P.  to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.  \n\nAs noted, the EME Homer City Generation Station already uses anhydrous ammonia in the ESP.  No accidental release of ammonia has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment.  To ensure that mitigation measures and emergency response plans are appropriate, potential release scenarios are considered.  Thus, the sections of the RMPlan which discuss both the worst-case and the alternative case, believed to be somewhat more probable, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety provided by the programs which constitute the EME Homer City ARP program. \n\n3.1  Worst-Case Release \n\nAs defined by 40 CFR Part 68, a worst-case release of a gas liquefied under pressure is a 10-minute ground-level release of the entire tank contents, taking into account passive and administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.  The worst-case release scenario for the Homer City facility is a gaseous release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank dispersed under stable meteorological conditions (see Section 3.1.1, below).  The worst-case scenario involves a quantity of 221,000 lbs. of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  This corresponds to maximum volume of liquid ammonia that is expected to be present in the tank at any time.  The amount of liquid ammonia in a tank is slightly less than the volume of the tank because procedures and safeguards are in place to ensure that t"

Administrative procedures and controls limit the quantity of ammonia in each tank. The standard operating procedure and alarms are set to allow the tank to be filled to no more than approximately 85% by volume. \n\n\n3.1.1  Dispersion Conditions\n\nMeteorologists have defined six atmospheric stability classes, A through F, each representing a decreasing degree of turbulence in the atmosphere.  The most turbulent condition is stability A, which is associated with light winds and very strong solar heating.  Stabilities B and C are characterized by progressively weaker solar heating and stronger winds.  Neutral, or D, stability occurs when winds are strong or when the sky is overcast.  At night the earth's surface cools, causing the lower atmosphere to stabilize and become less turbulent.  Stability E (moderately stable) corresponds to partly cloudy conditions with moderate winds.  Stability class F (very stable) represents a very low level of turbulence due to overnight radiational cooling and weak winds.  U.S. EPA requires that worst-case analyses be conducted using stability class F and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  Analysis of meteorological data collected by the National Weather Service at Pittsburgh International Airport  indicates that these dispersion conditions commonly occur at night during fair weather.\n\nTo describe aerodynamic surface roughness for modeling purposes, U.S. EPA's regulation establishes two roughness categories based on land-use in the vicinity of the process. Urban surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles to the flow, such as industrial buildings or trees.  Rural indicates that there are no large buildings in the area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.  By this definition, the vicinity of the SCR process at the Homer City facility with its large buildings, stacks, coal piles and cooling towers is cla"

Thus, while the dike under the anhydrous ammonia tank provides mitigation, it cannot be considered to have an effect on the worst-case release rate.  There are virtually no hypothetical events short of a sudden tank rupture that could result in a release of the entire contents of an ammonia pressure vessel in only 10 minutes. \n\nThe possibility of a worst-case type of scenario is extremely remote and virtually prohibited, given the design of the ammonia storage system and inspection and maintenance measures that EME has taken as part of its accident prevention program.  Even if such an event were to occur,  only a fraction of the pressurized liquid ammonia would be released directly to the air as a gas because the liquid ammonia would be cooled by the loss of heat needed for vaporization to below its boiling point and would be contained in the dike, where it would be released to the air over a period of time.  The dike would therefore substantially reduce the rate of release to the air and associated off-site migration of high concentrations.  \n\nThe dike would also isolate a liquefied ammonia release from the sewer lines to the wastewater treatment system and serve to protect any nearby workers from exposure. \n\n3.1.3  Modeling Method\n\nWorst-case dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  RMP*COMP implements the consequence analysis calculations set forth in the U.S. EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG). \n\nThe toxic endpoint chosen by the U.S. EPA for ammonia is 200 parts per million (ppm).  This level is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which was developed by"

An ERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects, or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  \n\nWithin the toxic endpoint zone for ammonia, the outdoor concentration at a stationary receptor, averaged over 10 minutes, could exceed 200 ppm.  Because this exposure level assumes a stationary receptor, it does not account for evasive or protective action.  Actions that could reduce or eliminate exposure to ammonia include avoiding the plume transport path, relocating beyond the planning zone, or seeking shelter in a building.\n\n3.1.4  Public and Environmental Receptors\n\nThe worst-case endpoint distance extends substantially beyond the facility property including residences, public recreation areas, schools and commercial areas as well as state game lands. \n\n\n3.2  Alternative Release for Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe alternative release examined for anhydrous ammonia corresponds to a hose rupture or coupling failure occurring during transfer from a tanker truck.  Liquefied ammonia from the leak could potentially spill into a secondary containment area outside of the tank dike area.  The ammonia release rate has been estimated to be equal to the normal transfer rate of 400 lbs./min lasting for 10 minutes.  According to the U.S. EPA's OCAG, this corresponds to a rupture of approximately 0.5 inches in diameter.  Release of liquefied gas to the air was conservatively assumed to be at the same rate as the spill because the portion that does not initially flash to a gas upon release would rapidly spread out into a shallow pool until the spill rate equaled the evaporation rate.  The spill is assumed to continue for 10 minutes before the truck operator or EME Homer City personnel are able to activate the transport trailer remote emergenc"

A break of this type would result in a large pressure change in the ammonia delivery hose and a greater initial ammonia release rate.  An emergency check valve located on the tanker truck is designed to sense the change in pressure due to this type of break and immediately shut down the flow of ammonia. The resulting ammonia spill would be limited to the amount of ammonia contained in the hose.  Because the resulting distance to toxic endpoint is expected to be much smaller than the endpoint for the alternative release scenario discussed above, this release is not reported in the RMPlan.\n\n3.2.1  Dispersion Conditions\n\nU.S. EPA suggests that alternative release scenarios be analyzed using typical meteorological conditions of D stability, and a wind speed of 3 m/sec.  Stability Class D represents conditions of neutral stability, or moderate atmospheric turbulence.  A temperature of 77 degrees F and relative humidity of 50 percent were also used in accordance with the OCAG.  Climatological data for Pittsburgh, PA indicate that these conditions are typical, with winds predominantly from the west.  \n\n3.2.2  Interpretation\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent releases that generally have a greater likelihood than the worst-case release and that occur during typical rather than worst-case meteorological conditions.  Unlike the worst-case release, alternative releases can account for both passive and active mitigation systems.  In accordance with U.S. EPA Guidance, the alternative release does not necessarily represent the type of release that the PSM hazard analysis and/or accident history indicate is the most likely to occur, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors. \n\n3.2.3  Modeling Method\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling to determ"

In conjunction with the current ARP and PSM programs in place at the EME Homer City facility, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected.  The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified.\n\n\n6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\nIt is the policy of the EME Homer City to place the highest priority on employee safety and health and on protection of the community from all plant-induced environmental conditions. Experience has shown that proper planning and an organized approach will reduce the effects of emergency events.  Prompt internal and external communications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel are the key ingredients of this plan.  EME Homer City's policy provides for external communications with local and county-wide response agencies.  The Indiana County HAZMAT Team has the lead responsibility in responding to major releases of ammonia that would have the potential to affect off-site locations.\n\n\n7.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\nEME Homer City, under the recent RMP program, as well as its existing PSM and earlier Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs, has organized its management system to effectively address hazards and potential risks.  Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.
