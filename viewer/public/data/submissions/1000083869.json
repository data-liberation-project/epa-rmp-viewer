This executive summary and program submittal describes and details the key elements of WPTP Risk Management Program (RMP), as well as the associated Process Safety Management (PSM) program elements. This document also summarizes our existing health and safety programs; our internal management implementation procedures; and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent, eliminate or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of digester gas to the environment. The WPTP is proud of its continuous dedication and commitment to ensuring accident prevention, employee safety and process safety, and as a result the WPTP has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\n** In demonstration of the WPTP's commitment to eliminate or minimize the impacts of potential accidental releases, as of August 2014, the WPTP has formally discontinued the use of chlorine gas for the disinfection of treated wastewater and has fully decommissioned the facility, equipment and documentation associated with the storage and use of liquid chlorine.  As a result, the WPTP has converted to the use of sodium hypochlorite for the disinfection of wastewater. Formal deregistration of the chlorine gas disinfection system will be certified by February 2015.**\n\n\n\n(1)Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nThe WPTP is totally dedicated and committed to ensuring the prevention of any potential for accidental releases of toxic and flammables materials. The WPTP accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, state of the art equipment, advan"

All applicable procedures of the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industries, Department The WPTP is proud of its continuous dedication and commitment to ensuring employee and process safety, and as a result the WPTP has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the WPTP comprehensively complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industries - Division of Occupational Safety and Health - Process Safety Management Program under Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 296-67.\n\n\n\n(2)Description of Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe WPTP is an integrated, advanced sewage treatment facility that provides both primary and secondary treatment of combined sewer system conveying and treating domestic and industrial wastewater, and storm water prior to discharge to Puget Sound. The site takes in\n\ncombined wastewater and storm water from 21 pump stations in Seattle, north King County, parts of south Snohomish County, and areas east of Lake Washington.  The WPTP is located on the Puget Sound at the western tip of Discovery Park between Shilshole Bay and Elliott Bay. Currently, the WPTP can provide secondary treatment for flows up to 300 MGD and provides primary treatment and disinfection for flows exceeding 300 MGD. The plants hydraulic capacity is 440 MGD. The West Point WWTP is rated as a US-EPA and WA-DOE Class IV treatment plant.\n\n\n\nThe liquid treatment process includes screening, grit removal, primary clarification, biological treatment using high rate oxygenated activated sludge, secondary clarification, sodium hypochlorite disinfection, and sodium bisulfite dechlorination.

The thickened sludge is anaerobically digested in a system of digesters, and dewatered by centrifuges. The plant produces biosolids used in agriculture and forestry, reclaimed water used for in-plant processes and irrigation. Digester gas (methane) is also produced and this gas is used onsite to fuel the raw sewage pump engines, power cogeneration system, and supplies heat to the plant systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable regulations and good engineering practices in\n\nthe operation of two processes that have a greater than threshold quantity of hazardous chemicals as defined in\n\nthe RMP requirements. These processes are the wastewater digester gas (methane flammable mixture) system and the propane fuel tank system.  \n\nIt is the policy of King County to meet and/or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local laws in the operation of all processes, and to design and operate the systems in accordance with the best industry standards to protect workers, visitors, and the public. \n\n\n\nThe WPTP digester gas was previously considered a system that was eligible for the exclusive fuel exemption, as the digester gas is used exclusively as a fuel for onsite processes. However, a joint assessment and interpretation ruling by EPA Region 10 and the State of Washington Department of Labor & Industries, interpreted that the digester gas system's recirculation of digester gas is considered a \"process use\" and therefore is not eligible for exemption from the RMP regulation. The propane storage tank system is utilized in 100% capacity as a back-up fuel system and is therefore considered exempt under the provisions of the exclusive fuel use exemption.\n\n\n\n(3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe gene"
