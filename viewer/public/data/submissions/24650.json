As part of operation, we use hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid in the cleaning operations.  Hydrofluoric acid is considered to be an extremely hazardous substance by the EPA.  The EPA classifies nitric and sulfuric acids as toxic chemicals.  The nature of hydrofluoric, nitric, and sulfuric acids make it necessary to observe certain precautions in their handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure in the facility and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, and the safety training and procedures that we use.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on a worst-case scenario and assumes the spill being contained with in the building. This plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2.

Assuming a worst case scenario of 24570 people per square mile, the 0.2 mile radius incident could affect around 3000 people and the 0.1 mile radius incident could affect 1500 people.  These numbers were calculated assuming that 60% of the population would be home or in the area at the time of the incident.  For Example, the 3000 affected population=(24570people x.2 mile radius x.6 (60 %) =_2948 people).  These estimates seem high when considering the location of the plant.  The 0.2 radius surrounding the plant is primarily industrial and railroad property. Much of the surrounding property inside of the 0.2-mile radius is used by the railroads and is not inhabited.  When these factors are considered, an affected population numbers of 1500 for the 0.2-mile incident and 750 for the 0.1-mile incident are still conservative numbers.  If the incident were to occur during an evening and/or weekend, these numbers would be significantly lower.  \n                                                                                                                                                                             4.

All transfers of liquids are completed within containment walls or diked areas with an employee present.  The surfaces of these areas have been lined with an acid resistant epoxy resin system.  Under the top coat of resin, there is a layer of figerglass that is designed to prevent thermal stress from fracturing the structure.

Part of their job duties is an hourly visual inspection of the process equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History: No reportable spills have occurred at this facility.                                                                                                                  \n\n6.  Emergency Response: The CSM Emergency Response Plan covers a wide range of emergency situations ranging from tornados to fire prevention.  The plant is equipped with a manual pull station fire alarm system that has a direct link to a monitoring company.  Pull stations are located at every exit and audio/visual strobe lights are strategically located throughout the plant.  In the event of an emergency, if the alarm system is sounded, the monitoring company will call the Euclid Fire Department.  The plant is occupied 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a Stationary Engineer.  Part of their normal hourly duties include plant inspections of the process equipment.

      "SummaryText": "Agencies which may need to be contacted in the event of an emergency.  CSM Indusries mailed a copy of its most recently reviewed ERP to the Euclid Fire Department on May 12, 1999.  The emergency response plan also includes a section on first aid and possible health effects for the toxic and hazardous materials in the plant.  MSDS sheets are also included in this document.  CSM Industries conducts yearly training on the different components of the ERP and conducts a yearly fire drill.                                                                                                                                                                      7.Planned Changes to improve Safety:During the Risk Management assessment process several areas in the process were noted that could be improved.  CSM Industries intends to add additional ventilation to the neutralization area.  A Colag scrubber unit will be added to this area to prevent fumes from an accidental release from escaping to the basement air.  Air monitoring equipment will be purchased and installed in this area to monitor the air borne acid concentrations.  Additional enclosures will be added to this room to better seal it off from the rest of the plant.  The electrical conduit runs and lighting will be upgraded to resist the possible corrosive environment.  CSM Industries hopes to complete these improvements in the next fiscal year."
