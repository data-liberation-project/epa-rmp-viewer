It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Chapman Rural Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\tThis facility is a farmer- owned cooperative. It is a co-op that handles and stores grain and retails general farm supplies and several agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, fuels, and petroleum products. We also provide custom application of chemicals and fertilizers for our farmer-patron's crop production needs. We do retail propane for both winter heating fuel and for grain drying purposes. We also retail Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) for fertilizer purposes for crop production for our farmer customers and patrons.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\tOur worst-case scenario for propane would be the failure of one of our 30,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is .4 of a mile. This would cover only                                                                                                                                            \nfour blocks of our town and involve a maximum of  600 people.

The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFTA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\tWe have never had an accident involving propane or anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\tIn the event of an emergency involving our propane or anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Chapman Rural Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department: 1) members of the fire department have inspected both our propane and anhydrous ammonia systems and 2) we have had two walk-thru's with the local fire department within the last three years to familiarize the members (especially new members) of the department with our facilites and what all is involved, what all we handle, and where everything is located. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\tWe plan to make it a policy to have walk-thru's with our local fire department at least once every two years. We also plan to review, upgrade, and analyze all of our company's safety policies at least every two years."
