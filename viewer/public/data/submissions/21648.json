If an emeergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Springfield Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a propane plant. We rail off load propane into storage tanks, for wholesale. Our storage tanks consist of four 30,000 gallon tanks and associated piping, valves, hoses and other miscelianeous epuipment.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the gresatest amount allowed (85% at 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is .43 miles. There are three private homes within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 11 people.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accoradance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Springfield Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department. Members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\nWe have no plans to make changes to improve safety.\n\nSigned by: Jerry Rosow\nPalnt Supt."
