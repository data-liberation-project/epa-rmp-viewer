Occidental Chemical Corporation's Ingleside Plant is an integral part of the OxyChem commitment to the industrial chemicals market. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Ingleside Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances and emergency response programs. OxyChem is focusing on individual employee responsibilities for working safely and achieving the targets of zero safety and environmental incidents.  This program includes training of all employees on the basic values and beliefs that all accidents and chemical releases are preventable and it is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that they are aware of the goals of zero incidents and will be held accountable for their actions.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe Ingleside Plant located on Highway 361 near Corpus Christi, Texas, produces important commodity chemicals such as chlorine, caustic soda, ethylene dichloride (EDC), and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  The Ingleside Plant is strategically located on 1,071 acres along the Texas Coastal Bend with excellent dock, pipeline, and rail facilities.  The site has nine regulated substances that are products, intermediates, or raw materials:\n\n\n\n               Chlorine                             Ethylene                                Propylene                            \n\n           "

Each of the sections listed below are documented and maintained in two documents at the plant; The Plant Safety and Health Procedures Manual and The OxyChem Process Reliability Guidelines Manual.  Each of these manuals is updated regularly.  The Ingleside Plant's prevention program has been prepared for compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and the EPA's Risk Management Rule (RMP) and consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n       Process Safety Information            Pre-startup Review                Management of Change\n\n       Process Hazard Analysis               Compliance Audit                  Mechanical Integrity\n\n       Operating Procedures                  Employee Participation            Contractor Safety  \n\n       Training                              Hot Work Permits \n\n       Emergency Response                    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nBefore using a hazardous substance at the Ingleside Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ingleside Plant, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.  The equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained "

      "SummaryText": "to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  OxyChem also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.  OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOn April 27, 2011, 8,400 lbs. of vinyl chloride was released from a PSV on the C-460 HCl column during a power interruption.  The power interruption ultimately resulted in the plant shutting down and pressure building up in the C-460 HCl column.  The PSV lifted and releasde to the EVS scrubber; however, when the PSV attempted to reseat it was unable to do so due to a 3/4\" flange bolt fastening nut that had lodged itself between the disc and the seat flange of the PSV. The HCl column continued to vent and, after displacing the HCl from the top of the column, VCM was ultimately released from C-490 EVS scrubber.  A total of 8,400 lbs. of VCM was later calculated as the release quantity.  There were no injuries or off site impacts as a result of this release.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Ingleside Plant has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (ERT) that is trained in these emergency response procedures.  The on-shift shift supervisors are the incident commanders and RMP emergency contact while on shift.  All plant personnel are trained in action they are expected to take in an emergency, such as evacuation procedures. In-plant drills are conducted periodically in order to test: the response time of the Emergency Resp"

The Ingleside Plant has a Chemical Emergency Response Team (CERP Team) that is available 24 hours per day to respond to in plant chemical emergencies. Plant uses a SAFER Real Time modeling program to assess release impacts if any and to aid in the determination of response activity. The San Patricio County Emergency Management Office with support from the LEPC has contracted with the City of Corpus Christi Police Department for the CCPD to provide community alerts for San Patricio County.  This system is used to notify the public of a potential or actual hazardous situation. In addition, the Ingleside Plant has developed a Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas, which can then provide assistance as, needed. The intent of the SSP is to aid the community after an event in order to return their quality of life back to normal as quickly as possible.  The facility is also an active member of the Coastal Plain Local Emergency Planning Committee - Serving Aransas, Refugio and San Patricio Counties\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Ingleside Plant constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  The key element of Ingleside's safety and environmental programs is prevention. Ingleside will continue to improve all its processes in order to prevent significant events from occurring in the future.\n\n"
