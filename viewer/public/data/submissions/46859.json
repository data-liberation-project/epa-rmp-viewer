              "Description": "This system is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of ammonia held in the storage tank. The unloading of ammonia tank trucks is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\nAmmonia pump (10-110-045B)\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. All nozzles on the tank are fitted with excess flow valves except for nozzles with pressure relief valves. A local level indicator is available on the tank with a transmitter conveying  the level measurement into the control room. This instrument is used to monitor and control the tank level.\n\nThe pressure relief valves are tested annually. The entire system undergoes annual maintenance which includes: external inspection, checks for any leaks, bolt tightness on the manway. Wall thickness tests are done every five years - the last test was 2003. An internal inspection of the welds was done in 2004.\n\nAmmonia is transferred to an ammonia / water mixer to prepare a solution that is pumped to a surge tank . The solution is then pumped to the chemical processing equipment and used to manufacture an agricultural product.\n\nAll changes to this system fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted for all changes.",

              "Description": "The unloading of ethyl mercaptan delivery vehicles and its storage and handling are governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit the amount of ethyl mercaptan held in the storage tank. Operators are trained and certified.\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. The tank contents are maintained at  about 40 degrees F. This tank vents via a conservation vent to a seal pot and then to an incinerator where the fumes are destroyed. Two flare systems are used to back up the incinerator for odor control.\n\nThe tank is equipped with emergency relief devices to protect against overpressurization. Redundant level instruments and a high level switch are used to monitor and control tank level. During railcar/tank truck unloading, an excess flow switch in the unloading system is used to close the automatic valve if high flow is detected. Remote emergency shut off stations close the unloading valve if activated.\n\nThe mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to produce an agricultural product. This equipment is equipped with a high level alarm and a high level switch that is interlocked to shutdown the feed and close the automatic valve. The reactor fumes are vented via a seal pot on their way to the incinerator for destruction. This system is also governed by operating procedures used by certified operators.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.\n\nThe entire mercaptan handling system undergoes annual maintenance and inspection as well as a five-year, vessel and piping thickness testing program and a 20 year internal inspection.",

The storage and handling system design minimizes potential leak spots by eliminating all tank bottom nozzles and by utilizing the redundant equipment such as rupture disk followed by a relief valve.  All fumes from the unloading process,  storage tanks and process are neutralized in a scrubber.  The scrubber has multiple layers of redundancy, including emergency power, to ensure continuous operation.  The tank farm area and process building are inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems.\nReactor (130-051)\nPump (110-020)\nReactor (120-001)\nReactor (150-001)\nPump (110-029)\n\nThe secondary containment areas for each storage tank are designed to hold or contain 110% of the storage tank volumes. Unique bulk containers and unloading stations are utilized to ensure that only the correct raw material can be unloaded into a given storage tank. Unloading procedures lock out and disable all non-participating unloading equipment.\n\nThe unloading system, storage tank and processing equipment are equipped with the instruments for monitoring process variables. The system is designed to prevent events such as tank over filling and over pressurization. The unloading process and storage tanks are monitored continuously by control and interlock systems. In addition, the process is also monitored continuously by trained operating personnel.\n\nThis process is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of materials held in the storage tank. The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.",

One ton cylinders are widely available and are used in variety of industries. The chlorine supplier owns and maintains the cylinders.\n\nThe cylinders are off loaded with the boom and placed into cradles designed to transport and store the cylinders. The cradles are equipped with rollers for correctly orienting the cylinder valves and are also equipped with the means to securely lock the cylinder in place on the cradle. A forklift truck is used to transport the cylinder and  cradle to the cylinder storage shed. The shed is designed to protect the cylinders from the weather.\n\nThe forklift truck is also used to move the cylinders to the vaporizer building when chlorine is needed in the manufacturing process. One cylinder will be connected to the vaporization process equipment at a time. A maximum of eight cylinders will be allowed in the dispensing or vaporizer building at any time.\n\nUnique pipe fittings are utilized to ensure that only chlorine is transferred to the process. The piping system is designed to minimize potential leak spots.\n\nThe chlorine vaporizer or dispensing building is inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems. It is also monitored continuously for chlorine leaks. If a leak is detected, the system will alarm, shutdown the transfer equipment, and automatically start ventilating  equipment. Trained operating staff will respond accordingly.\n\nThe chlorine transfer system and processing equipment are equipped with instruments for monitoring the process. The system is designed to prevent events such as tank overfilling and over pressurization. The process is monitored  continuously by control and interlock systems as well as trained operating personnel. A relatively low chlorine inventory in maintained in the process vessels. It reacts immediately.\n\nThis process operating procedures and administrative controls are designed to limit the chlorine inventory in the storage shed and dispensing buildings.  The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.",

The storage and handling system design minimizes potential leak spots by eliminating all tank bottom nozzles and by utilizing the redundant equipment such as rupture disk followed by a relief valve.\n\nAll fumes from the unloading process, storage tank and process are neutralized in a scrubber.  The scrubber has multiple layers of redundancy, including emergency power, to ensure continuous operation.  The tank farm area and process building are inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems.\n\nThe secondary containment area for the storage tank is designed to hold or contain 110% of the storage tank volume.  Unique bulk container fittings (connectors)  are used to ensure that only the correct raw material can be unloaded into a given storage tank. Unloading procedures are used to lock out and disable all non-participating unloading equipment.\n\nThe unloading system, storage tank and processing equipment are equipped with the instruments for monitoring process variables. The system is designed to prevent events such as tank over filling and over pressurization. The unloading process and storage tank is monitored continuously by control and interlock systems. In addition, the process is also monitored continuously by highly trained operating personnel.\n\nThis process is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of materials held in the storage tank. The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by plant policies and operating procedures.

              "Description": "Anhydrous trimethylamine is unloaded from a high pressure, bulk trailer into a storage tank. Unique pipe fittings are used to ensure that only the correct raw material can be unloaded into the storage tank. The piping system design minimizes potential leak spots by utilizing the latest equipment such as \"mag drive\" pumps (no seals), excess flow valve on the bottom of the storage tank (stops flow if excessive, such as a leak), rupture disk followed by a relief valve, and low emission packing valves. The secondary containment area for the storage tank is designed to hold or contain 110% of the storage tank volume. All fumes from the tank farm and process vessels are burned in a thermal oxidizer.\nReactor 140-001\nReactor 220-001\nPump   220-004\n\nThe unloading system, storage tank and processing equipment are equipped with instruments for monitoring process variables. The system is designed to prevent incidents such as tank over filling and over pressurization. The unloading process and storage tank are monitored continuously by control and interlock systems. In addition, the process is also monitored continuously by trained operating personnel.\n\nThe tank farm area is inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems. The process building is continuously monitored for trimethylamine as well as other chemicals. Upon detection of a trimethyamine leak in the process building the system will alarm and the trained operating staff will respond accordingly to isolate all equipment containing the amine.\n\nThe plant electrical systems meet all codes and guidelines for a facility handling flammable liquids. The unloading area, tank farm, and process building are equipped with appropriate fire-fighting systems.\n\nThe process is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit the amount of trimethylamine held in the storage tank. The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety managment of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.",
