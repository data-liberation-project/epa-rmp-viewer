The MOCVD Hardware Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Toshiba's employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nToshiba is operating one 24,000 lb. bulk anhydrous ammonia ISO trailer with associated gas distribution systems, tools, detection, and abatement systems (Wet Scrubber and Ammonia Diffuser Tank). The bulk ammonia trailer is a Praxair ISO container that contains high purity white ammonia (anhydrous ammonia) connected to a high pressure control manifold. The pressure relief valves on the trailer are connected to an ammonia diffuser tank to treat a potential release of ammonia from these valves. The ammonia diffuser tank is vented to the wet scrubber to meet the 2007 California Fire Code requirement of 50% IDLH. The exhausted enclosures on the ISO trailer and the ammonia system are vented directly to the 50,000 SCFM wet scrubber for treatment. The high pressure manifold system contains equipment to filter, regulate [High Pressue Control Module - (HPCM)], purify, and monitor flow from the bulk ammonia container. The ammonia from the HPCM is connected into automatic valve manifold boxes (AVMB), to two purifiers. Each of these purifiers are connected to two HPCMs, which are connected to the ammonia system that feeds the MOCVD reactors within the facility. An emergency abatement system is also installed to capture ammonia in the event of an accidental release at the connections to th"

See Material and Energy Balance Block Flow Diagram in the Prevention Program 3 section (Attachment 1-2), for an overview of LED Manufacturing Process and the bulk anhydrous ammonia ISO trailer.  \n\nAll connection points, including the pressure relief devices on the ISO trailer, are provided with ventilated enclosures in case of an accidental release. The bulk ammonia system meets all of the Toxic Gas Ordinance requirements for a Class II material. Class II was selected because the Toshiba system is greater than the Class III material amount. In addition to using Praxair's proven safety control systems, Toshiba has performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on the bulk ammonia system to verify that all safety and engineering controls were in place on October 30, and November 3, 2009. The PHA was revalidated on April 6, 8 and 9, 2015.\n\nThis anhydrous ammonia system is the only process at this site to which the CALARP RMP requirements are applicable.\n\nThe site includes one building with a facilities pad, an ammonia trailer enclosure which contains the bulk anhydrous ammonia ISO trailer, and an ammonia diffusion tank.  \n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release quantity was defined as the amount held in the bulk anhydrous ammonia ISO trailer (i.e., 24,000 pounds). Since the vessel is located outdoors, there are no mitigating controls assumed.\n\n The alternative release scenarios considered both the five-year accident history, and the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Toshiba on October 30 and November 3, 2009 and revalidated with Toshiba on April 6, 8 and 9, 2015. When these other scenarios were evaluated, the end results were no worse than the selected alternative release scenario. The selected alternative release scenario assumed that the line that connects the trailer to the high pressure regulator panel was broken for any reason that resulted in a maximum of 5,000 liters per minute of ammonia gas flow. \n\n The al"

There has not been any ammonia releases resulting in on- or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or in off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nToshiba has developed a Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies, as well as other site emergencies. The plan is maintained at the MOCVD Hardware Manager and/or Equipment Manager office offices and at the facility's front desk. The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of minor ammonia releases. The Fire Department will be used to respond to any non-minor leaks or leaks that cannot be repaired. Toshiba has a trained \"Emergency Coordinator.\" In the event of a non-minor leak, Toshiba will evacuate and take initial life safety precautions.
