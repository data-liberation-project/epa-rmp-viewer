Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture specialty chemicals.  Ten chemicals in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA and exceed the RMP Threshold Quantity (TQ).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  APMC manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  These specialty chemicals are used by our customers to manufacture other product used in a variety of application.  Raw materials are received at our plant by rail car, bulk tank truck, drums and pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feed stock is then fed to vessels.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat and hydrogen, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into product crude"

The pure product is then stored in tanks on site and shipped to customers via rail car, bulk tank truck, tote bins or drums. \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of toxics or flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.
