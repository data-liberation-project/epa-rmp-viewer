      "SummaryText": "The Meadows Water Treatment Plant, located in Branson, Mo, is in its twenty second year of operation. It is\r\n\r\ndesigned to produce five million gallons of high quality drinking water per day. The facility lies on approximately 8 \r\n\r\nacres of land that is equal to or higher in elevation than most of the surrounding terrain. The plant is manned 24 \r\n\r\nhours a day, 7 days a week by experienced, certified operators, under the direction of an Operations \r\n\r\nManager.              \r\n\r\n           A chemical storage building and operations building occupy the site along with four settling basins, \r\n\r\neach with a holding capacity of 500,000 gallons. Chemicals used on site are Polyaluminum \r\n\r\nHydroxychloride, Hydrofluosilicic Acid ( Fluoride ), and Chlorine. Each of these chemicals are potentially \r\n\r\nhazardous if not handled properly. Polyaluminum Hydroxychloride is used in the treatment process as a \r\n\r\ncoagulant to settle suspended solids in the outside settling basins, prior to filitration. This chemical is kept in \r\n\r\na 5000 gallon storage tank which sits in a leak proof containment area. Should the tank ever fail, allowing a \r\n\r\nspill to occur, the chemical would be confined to the containment area.  Polyaluminum Hydroxycloride is \r\n\r\nonly considered hazardous because of a low pH in its concentrated form and requires minimal safety \r\n\r\nrequirements. The two remaining chemicals that are used in the treatment process,  require strict safety \r\n\r\npractices in handling. \r\n                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n            Fluoride is used in water treatment as a prevention for tooth decay. Fluoride is a natural component \r\n\r\nin most water supplies but amounts are usually not high enough to be of any  benefit for this purpose.   \r\n\r\nEnough fluoride is added to our water supply to obtain .5 to .9 MG/L residual.  While fluoride is safe"

      "SummaryText": "when \r\n\r\nused properly, it is considered hazardous in its concentrated form. We receive fluoride in bulk form. \r\n\r\nIt is then stored in a 1500 gallon bulk tank which also sits in a containment area that will catch any \r\n\r\nspills which might occur. \r\n\r\n            Chlorine is used in the disinfection process of the water treatment. A residual of 1.2 to 1.8 MG/L  \r\n\r\nremains in the finished water leaving the plant. Chlorination is a safe and effective way to prevent \r\n\r\nbacterial contamination in the water system. However, chlorine in a gas or compressed liquid form has a \r\n\r\npotential to be extremely hazardous if not handled properly. This chemical is shipped to our facility in 1-ton \r\n\r\nchlorine gas cylinders. A vacuum system is used to remove the chlorine from the cylinders at a specified \r\n\r\nrate. Should the system fail, causing loss of vacuum, regulators mounted directly to the cylinder valve will \r\n\r\nclose to prevent any loss of chlorine into the atmosphere. Should a regulator fail and allow a release, a leak detector \r\n\r\nwill signal automatic cylinder valve closers to close the cylinder valve. Employees who handle chlorine are required to \r\n\r\nreceive extensive training prior to working with the chemical and are involved in continous training to stay up to date \r\n\r\nwith safety practices. \r\n\r\n\r\n            As of June 21, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that all facilities which store  \r\n\r\nchemicals such as chlorine in quantities greater than 2500 pounds, to establish a Risk Management Program. The Risk \r\n\r\nManagement Program for the Meadows Water Treatment Plant includes an Action Plan that will be put into effect in the \r\n\r\nevent of a hazardous chemical release. This plan provides guidlines to assure that hazardous material (HAZMAT) \r\n\r\nemergencies are handled in a manner consistent with current regulations and safety practices. The plan is intended to \r\n\r\ncover all releases of hazardous chemicals regardless of size. Although a small spill or"

      "SummaryText": "leak does not entail the same \r\n\r\ncomplex response mechanism as a massive release, it still has the potential to produce localized injury or damage. The \r\n\r\nintent of this plan is to ensure that all plant personnel approach every HAZMAT incident from an informed \r\n\r\nperspective. In this way, adequate precautions can be taken to minimize the degree of hazard to our \r\n\r\nemployees and the public.\r\n\r\n            During a hazardous material emergency at the plant, a trained supervisor will take charge of \r\n\r\nresponse activities. The trained supervisor will first assess whether the release is considered \r\n\r\nemergency or incidental. Incidental releases will be handled by plant personnel, while emergency releases \r\n\r\nwill require a response by the Branson Fire Department.\r\n\r\n            The Meadows Action Plan details response activities of trained HAZMAT personnel and lines of communication \r\n\r\nand authority between responders from Police, Fire, and Utilities departments. The plan also describes specific \r\n\r\nresponsibilities of trained  individuals, as well as steps of mobilization, mitigation, and types of safety equipment \r\n\r\nneeded. Clean-up procedures and levels of training to perform clean-up are described. Also included are methods of \r\n\r\naccident prevention, instructions for evaluation and follow-up meetings to review problems encountered during the \r\n\r\nresponse and ways to improve response time and communications in the event of a future incident. The action plan will \r\n\r\nbe exercised as needed so procedures can be updated as necessary.\r\n\r\n            We believe this plan to be comprehensive, informative, and adequate."
