To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as Source Industrial Code (SIC) 2611 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n2. Chlorine\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process.\n\n\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nReporting requirement removed. \n\n\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\n1.4.1   Process Safety Information\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill has compiled written Process Safety Information (PSI) before conducting any process hazard analysis as required by the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The PSM standard requirements for PSI are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.65.  This compilation of written process safety information enables Rayonier and the employees involved in operating the processes to identify and understand the possible hazards posed by those processes involving toxic substances.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the toxic substances used in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\n\nPSI has been collected and updated for Rayonier's four RMP process systems: ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.

Revalidations are required at least every five years and began in 1999. \n\n\nOf the methods commonly used for analysis or reviews, the \"HAZOP\" and \"Checklist\" methods are typically used at the Fernandina mill.  PHA's identify, evaluate and control hazards involved the process.  Rayonier also has a system in place to address any findings and recommendations.  This system ensures that recommendations are:\n1.  Resolved in a timely manner,\n2.  Documented, and \n3.  Communicated to the affected employees. \n\n\n1.4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nRayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill has developed, implemented, and maintains clearly written detailed procedures for safely operating and maintaining a process during all operating modes.  In addition to operating procedures, safe work practices have been developed and implemented for the control of hazards and include hot work, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, lockout/tagout, and control over the entrance into a stationary source.  These safe work procedures are in place and are reviewed and revised as needed, but at least on an annual basis.\n\n\n1.4.4    Training\n\nEach employee at Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill involved in operating a covered process has been trained to operate it safely and understands the training.  They also h"

Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill also gathers input from the employees involved in operating covered processes to aid in determining the appropriate frequency of refresher training.  This input is normally accomplished by the use of surveys and or interviews. \n\n\n1.4.5    Mechanical Integrity\n\nRayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill already has a mechanical integrity system in place due to the requirements of PSM.  Under the RMP rule 40 CFR 68.73, Rayonier has adopted this mechanical integrity system.  The system ensures that the process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.  It includes written procedures, training, inspection, and testing, correcting system deficiencies and quality assurance.  These tasks are discussed further in the PSM Mechanical Integrity manual.\n\n\n1.4.6    Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is in place at Rayonier to prevent changes in the process and supporting equipment from introducing unacceptable hazards to workers.  This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes, which need to be made to a PSM/RMP covered process.  The procedures require review prior to the change with a special emphasis on safety and training of employees and contractors.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and procedures must be updated when a change is made and is addressed with this MOC system.\n\n\n1.4.7    Pre-Startup Review\n\nPrior to starting up any new covered process or modified covered process, Rayonier performs a pre-startup safety review when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This review ensu"

This review is done before startup just in case safety items have not been verified.  This final pre-startup review aids in making sure the changes in the system are ready for startup.  \n\n\n1.4.8    Compliance Audits\n\nAt least every three years, Rayonier evaluates the effectiveness of the PSM system.  Audits are performed to determine that the system complies with the provisions in the PSM standard and that the systems procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  PSM audits are retained until all action items are completed and two subsequent audits are performed.  Rayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill?s most recent internal compliance audit for PSM / RMP was performed in June 2002. The most recent external compliance audit was conducted in April 2003 by the Florida Department of Community Affairs. \n\n\n1.4.9    Incident Investigation\n\nRayonier investigates every incident, which results in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The investigation starts as soon as possible but not later than 48 hours after an incident.  The incident report is then retained for five years.\n\n\n1.4.10    Employee Participation\n\nRayonier has developed a written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in evaluating covered processes.  Rayonier consults with and involves employees and their representatives to obtain feedback to the details of each covered process.  This written plan is located in the PSM documentation.  Employees participate in PHA's, gathering information, incident investigations, training, written operating procedures, and the other elements as needed.\n\n\n1.4.11    Hot Work Permit\n\nRayonier issues hot work permits for any hot work operations conducted on or near covered processes.

      "SummaryText": "S TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of the workers and the community.  There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  The \"Behavior Based Safety\" (BBS) program to improve overall safety performance is entitled \"H.A.W.K.\" (Halting Accidents With Knowledge). and is underway with a steering committee guiding the effort while training each employee.  The H.A.W.K. concept is based on changing worker behavior by individually conducting observations and providing feedback to other employees as they perform their duties.\n\nMajor efforts to improve safety are also underway with Rayonier's \"Job Safety Analysis\" (JSA) program.  The program consists of systematically analyzing jobs from a safety perspective.  This is accomplished by identifying all the jobs performed and breaking each job down into the steps taken to complete each task.  The potential accidents and hazards of each task are identified and recommendations are then provided on how to prevent these hazards from occurring.  Employees participate in this program by providing input on each analysis.  The resulting JSA's are used in training each employee on how to do the job safely.\n\nIncident investigations are also performed to improve safety.  These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers.  There is also a program to solicit safety suggestions from workers.  As a result of these activities, improvements can be achieved.  \n\nThe following is a list of process safety improvements, which are planned or have recently been completed.\n1. The emergency cut-off valves have been relocated to the top of the Chlorine railcar. This allows isolation of the liquid chlorine prior to the unloading hose in the unlikely event that a hose is accidentally severed.\n2. Cameras have been added at the railcar unloading stations for Chlorine, Ammonia, and Sulfur Dioxide.\n3. Unloading hoses have been changed"

There is a plan to move the emergency cut-off valves to the top of the Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide railcars, as was done on the Chlorine railcar. This will allow the chemical to be isolated ahead of the unloading hose in the unlikely event that a hose is accidentally severed.\n\n\n2.0    CERTIFICATION\n\nRefer to the attached form.\n\n3.0    REGISTRATION\n\nRefer to the attached form."
