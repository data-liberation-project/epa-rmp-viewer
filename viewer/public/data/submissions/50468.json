Each permit is kept on file until completion of the hot work operations and inspections.\n\n\n1.4.12    Contractors\n\nRayonier selects contractors who perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process by obtaining and evaluating their safety performance and programs.  Each contractor is informed of any known hazards related to the contractor's work and the process and any applicable emergency response procedures.  Rayonier has implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence, and exit of each contractor in covered process areas.  \nRayonier periodically evaluates the performance of each contractor in fulfilling their obligations.  Contractors are obligated to:\n1.  Assure that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job;\n2.  Assure that each contract employee is instructed in the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to his/her job and the process, and all applicable emergency response procedures;\n3.  Document that each contract employee has received and understood the required training;\n4.  Assure that each contract employee follows safety rules and safe work practices;\n5.  Advise Rayonier of any unique hazards presented by the contractor's work or of any hazards found.\n\n\n1.5   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRayonier keeps thorough records for all significant accidental chemical releases which occur at the Fernandina facility.

This emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n1.  Training responsible employees on procedures for being the First Responder in the event of a release.\n2.  Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances.\n3.  Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\n4.  Informing the local Nassau County Emergency Management team, which is responsible for responding to accidental releases, which could reasonably result in off site consequences. \n5.  Procedures for informing the public when necessary. \n6.  Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment.\n7.  Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  Rayonier periodically conducts emergency response drills.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [i.e. OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and 29 CFR 1910.120(a)] and has been communicated to the local emergency response officials.

      "SummaryText": "S TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of the workers and the community.  There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  The Behavior Based Safety (BBS) program to improve overall safety performance is entitled H.A.W.K. (Halting Accidents With Knowledge). and is underway with a steering committee guiding the effort while training each employee.  The H.A.W.K. concept is based on changing worker behavior by individually conducting observations and providing feedback to other employees as they perform their duties.\n\nMajor efforts to improve safety are also underway with Rayonier's Job Safety Analysis (JSA) program.  The program consists of systematically analyzing jobs from a safety perspective.  This is accomplished by identifying all the jobs performed and breaking each job down into the steps taken to complete each task.  The potential accidents and hazards of each task are identified and recommendations are then provided on how to prevent these hazards from occurring.  Employees participate in this program by providing input on each analysis.  The resulting JSA's are used in training each employee on how to do the job safely.\n\nIncident investigations are also performed to improve safety.  These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers.  There is also a program to solicit safety suggestions from workers.  As a result of these activities, improvements can be achieved.  \n\nThe following is a list of process safety improvements, which are planned or have recently been completed.\n1. The emergency cut-off valves have been relocated to the top of the Chlorine railcar. This allows isolation of the liquid chlorine prior to the unloading hose in the unlikely event that a hose is accidentally severed.\n2. Cameras have been added at the railcar unloading stations for Chlorine, Ammonia, and Sulfur Dioxide.\n3. Unloading hoses have been changed"

This input is normally accomplished by the use of surveys and or interviews. \n\n\n1.4.5    Mechanical Integrity\n\nRayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill already has a mechanical integrity system in place due to the requirements of PSM.  Under the RMP rule 40 CFR 68.73, Rayonier has adopted this mechanical integrity system.  The system ensures that the process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.  It includes written procedures, training, inspection, and testing, correcting system deficiencies and quality assurance.  These tasks are discussed further in the PSM Mechanical Integrity manual.\n\n\n1.4.6    Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is in place at Rayonier to prevent changes in the process and supporting equipment from introducing unacceptable hazards to workers.  This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes, which need to be made to a PSM/RMP covered process.  The procedures require review prior to the change with a special emphasis on safety and training of employees and contractors.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and procedures must be updated when a change is made and is addressed with this MOC system.\n\n\n1.4.7    Pre-Startup Review\n\nPrior to starting up any new covered process or modified covered process, Rayonier performs a pre-startup safety review when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as Source Industrial Code (SIC) 2611 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n2. Chlorine\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process.\n\n\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nReporting requirement removed. \n\n\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\n1.4.1   Process Safety Information\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill has compiled written Process Safety Information (PSI) before conducting any process hazard analysis as required by the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.
