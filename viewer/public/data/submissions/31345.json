BMD Enterprises has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1972.\n\nBMD Enterprises' president is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The president administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1972. The process is located at 4959 East Dakota Avenue, Fresno, California 93727. The chlorine transfer process for BMD Enterprises, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels. Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder. The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 8,000 pounds. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nBMD Enterprises has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.  A manual alarm is located near the chlorine fill station which can be activated to warn employees in the case of a chlorine release.  The area is secured with crash posts and the"

      "SummaryText": " ton containers are secured to stands in case of an earthquake.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (May 2004) the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there have been no reportable releases of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, BMD Enterprises' response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  BMD Enterprises has a B-kit available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBMD Enterprises has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (May 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit will be completed by December 31, 2004.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation resulted in the following recommendation (estimated completion date 12/31/2004):  \n\nREV01: Ensure that refresher training is conducted every 3 years as stated in the PSM/RMP Program.\n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
