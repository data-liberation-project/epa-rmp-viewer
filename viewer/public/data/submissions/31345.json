BMD Enterprises has a B-kit available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBMD Enterprises has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (May 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit will be completed by December 31, 2004.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation resulted in the following recommendation (estimated completion date 12/31/2004):  \n\nREV01: Ensure that refresher training is conducted every 3 years as stated in the PSM/RMP Program.\n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
