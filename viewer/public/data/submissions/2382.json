Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Harvey Lyman Company's Walnut Grove facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 14,301 Railroad Avenue, Walnut Grove, California, 95690 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 15,000-gallon and one 10,000-gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 108,400 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 20,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The tanks are located within a secondary containment structure. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 300,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is 90,000 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 65,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia into the secondary containment, which represents the volume of the larges"

      "SummaryText": "t storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.78 miles.   The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release from a broken 3-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.20 miles.\n\nb.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 150,000 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 45,000 pounds ammonia based on a 30% active ingredient).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.67 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was writte"
