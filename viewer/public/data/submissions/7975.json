(O'Brien & Gere) on behalf of Country Pure Foods, Inc.'s Ardmore Farms facility (Ardmore Farms) in DeLand, Florida.  The plan was prepared to fulfill the requirements of Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) pursuant to United States Environmental Protection Administration (USEPA) regulations contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  This RMP is intended to be used in conjuction with Ardmroe Farms' current Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) and Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThese regulations require stationary sources with listed substances present in a process in greater than the threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The risk management program must be described in an RMP that must be registered with USEPA, submitted to appropriate agencies, and made available to the public.  In the Ardmore Farms faciliity, anhyrdous ammonia, which is a listed substance in the RMP regulations, is stored in greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 68, Subpart G, 68.150-68.190, which describes the format of the written RMP.  Based on a review of the applicable regulations, Prevention Program 3 requirements apply to this facility.\n\nAn updated RMP, including an updated off-site consequences analysis, is required within five years of its initial submission or its most recent update.  A compliance audit to certify compliance with the provisions of the RMP regulations is required at least every three years.\n\nThe written RMP was developed based upon site visits conducted by O'Brien & Gere between teh months of June and August 1998.  During the site visits, the ammonia storage system was inspected and system design and operating procedures and information were collected.  A revi"

The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68 regulations, as well as guidance provided by teh USEPA RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) document.  The hazard assessment is detailed in Section 3 and Appendix A of this plan.\n\nA Program 3 Prevention Program was prepared based on a review of the system and its associated operating, maintenance and training procedures."
