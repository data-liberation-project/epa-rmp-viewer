THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management and employees of New Vision Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.\n\n     - Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed both for direct application for crop production \n        nutrients.\n\n     - The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 135,000 pounds in our 1- 30,000 gallon\n       storage tank.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage \n         tank released as a gas over 10.4 minutes for anhydrous ammonia. The maximum quantity released\n         would be 135,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as\n         limited by design standards. The distance to the end point od dispersion to 200ppm is 1.12 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario is a 2 minute release from a 3\" pipe break resulting in a distance of\n         .78 miles.\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n      The facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of\nanhydrous ammonia,  K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and health Administration-OSHA-,29CRF 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammon"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     - The facility has:\n     a. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29CRF 1910.38;\n\n     b. Provided State and Local Authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know\n         information as required under SARA Title lll-EPCRA;\n\n     c.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
