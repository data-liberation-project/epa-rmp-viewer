Specific programs in place include this Risk Management Program which was developed in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA): the Spill Prevention Report (SPR) in accordance with New York State?s Chemical Bulk Storage (CBS) regulations (5 NYCRR Parts 595-599): an Integrated Contingency Plan: Guidelines and Procedures for Hazardous Materials Emergencies: and Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program. All of these plans and programs have been developed to prevent or minimize the occurrence of spills or releases of hazardous substances, as well as to ensure the appropriate response measures that will be implemented by Nepera in the event of a spill or release of a hazardous substance.\n\nNepera has implemented a Community Alert Network enabling the facility to activate recorded telephone messages providing critical safety information to key community agencies, officials and local residents in the event of a release or emergency at the facility.\n\nNepera has installed a state of the art Perimeter Monitoring System using FTIR IR scanner, which detects and identifies hazardous substance emissions that might reach beyond our fenceline. This system has been programmed to provide warning levels and alarm levels of hazardous substances stored and processed at Nepera. Should warning or alarm levels be reached, our staff has been trained to activate the Community Alert Network and the Early Warning System at the local public park. Each of these systems will provide information as to what actions the community should take as a result of an emergency.\n\nNepera maintains an internal Emergency Response Organization including Fire Bri"

Nepera has an on-site chemical fire rated  fire truck, hose houses and a foam fire suppression system, emergency response truck, and spill response lockers located throughout the site for ready access in the event of an emergency. These teams are comprised of employees from all shifts providing response capabilities 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and have been fully trained to mitigate fires and/or spills that might be associated with incidents involving any substances handled at the facility.\n\nNepera Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nNepera stores the regulated substances anhydrous ammonia, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde in storage tanks at various locations within the facility at quantities above the Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds as well as quantities of mixed flammables derived from these raw materials. The substances are delivered to Nepera via rail car or tank truck and transferred to storage tanks. These substances are then pumped via pipelines from the storage tanks to the process reactors on site. All rail cars, tank trucks, storage tanks and associated equipment are inspected before receiving/each use ensuring its safe operation and is monitored continuously by on-site personnel in the filed or from the control room. The rail car area has continuous video monitoring between the rail car siding and the operator control room.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThis section has been omitted because of security considerations as allowed by the revised regulations\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Nepera facility, as a Program 3 Facility, is required to develop a Prevention Program under Section 112(r) of the CAA. The Prevention Program at the Nepera facility is written in accordance with 40 CF1~. 68 Subpart D. The Prevention Program implemented at Nepera consists of the following areas; process safety information, process hazard analy"

Nepera did conduct a detailed compliance audit in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Program (29 CFR 1910.119) in May of 1998 and will have completed all identified deficiencies by June 1999. This audit was comprehensive and included all twelve elements of the Process Safety Management program. This audit information is reflected in the RMP Submission, Prevention Program Level 3, items 7.10(a) and (b) for each of the three identified programs.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred during the five year reporting period (1999 to 2004).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Nepera facility maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan, which has been coordinated with the local emergency response agencies and includes provisions for public notification in the event of a release. Nepera conducts regular emergency drills in cooperation with the local Fire Department and the Orange County LEPC. The facility maintains Guidelines and Procedures for Hazardous Materials Emergencies to be followed by on-site Emergency Response Team members as well as by external response agencies.\n\nContinuous Environmental, Health, Safety, & Security Improvements\n\nNepera, being aware of the effects of an accidental release of the regulated substances at the facility, maintains an Emergency Response Program and Integrated Contingency Plan. These plans are routinely reviewed and updated to ensure the safety of Nepera?s employees, the general public and the environment.  Nepera continually investigates incidents and near misses to take full advantage of all opportunities for continuous improvement of our high hazard processes."
