The Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC (Facility) is taking a proactive, managed approach to risk. The Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site personnel, the community, contractors, and the environment. To meet this commitment, Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the process. One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of aqueous ammonia (>20 weight percent), the only hazardous substance stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to Program 2 of 40 CFR 68. \r\n\r\nTo protect the environment, aqueous ammonia is used at the Facility to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx, which are generated from the combustion of natural gas.  Specifically, ammonia is the reducing agent used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control systems. The SCR is a post-combustion gas treatment technique that reduces nitrous oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the turbine exhaust stream to molecular nitrogen and water. The SCR systems are comprised of a number of subsystems. These subsystems include the SCR reactor with associated fluework, the ammonia vaporization and injection system, and the ammonia storage and delivery system. All subsystems are equipped with the required controls and interlocks. \r\n\r\nThe Facility is located in a sparsely populated rural area and has never had a reportable accident. Ammonia is a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer.  Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125  Exemptions - Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68). \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result"

The RMP includes procedures which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences. \r\n\r\nThe Facility has chosen to use a dilute solution of ammonia rather than the inherently more dangerous anhydrous form. The storage quantity of ammonia was reduced as much as possible. The storage tank area is diked and partially enclosed. The facility property is partially encompassed by a series of landscape berms, which would have a mitigating effect on an ammonia vapor plume.\r\n\r\nAt this Facility, comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response programs have been established.

Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC is committed to the safety of workers, contractors, and the public, as well as to the preservation of the environment. Dynegy Kendall Energy, LLC will implement the measures necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of the substances regulated by 40 CFR 68. The measures include:\r\n\r\n* Employee training in accidental release prevention and emergency response programs/measures;\r\n* Establishment of safety programs for Facility operations, design, and maintenance of the regulated process; and\r\n* Establishment of a hazard assessment process.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Facility has never had a reportable accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe Dynegy Kendall Energy Facility, located at 1401 County Line Road in Minooka, Illinois, is a nominal 1,100-megawatt natural gas-fired combined-cycle power generating plant that includes four gas turbines, four heat recovery steam generators, and four reheat condensing steam turbines.

The aqueous ammonia is stored at ambient temperature and will have a maximum pressure of 50 pounds per square inch-gauge (psig). The total amount of ammonia stored will not exceed 33,545.25 lbs, which is rounded to 34,000 lbs for RMP comp calculations.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia \"storage\" and the \"vaporization / injection system\" is the process considered for the RMP at this Facility.

The vaporized ammonia/air mixture is injected upstream of the SCR catalyst in each of the Heat Recovery Steam Generation (HRSG) units. The vaporized ammonia/air mixture is approximately at 550 degrees F.  Four new 500 gallon tanks containing ammonia diluted to <20% were installed in April 2009.

The process safety measures and documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design/configuration information and diagrams. MSDS are maintained at the Facility to provide chemical specific information. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to help identify and control recognized hazards associated with the regulated process. Within this program, the aqueous ammonia storage and the SCR process is systematically examined to recognized hazards and to verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The process hazard analysis program is to be reviewed and updated every five (5) years, as required.\r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures for the aqueous ammonia AST system operations are in place, including system startup, normal operations, system shutdown, and unloading operations, to ensure consistency of operations and reduce the potential for accidents. These procedures are to be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are to be periodically reviewed for accuracy and reliability.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, a comprehensive employee training program has been developed for all employees involved in process operations.

After training for new operators is complete, the new operators are to be teamed with experienced operators to learn process specific duties and tasks. After these new operators demonstrate adequate skills and knowledge of the operating requirements and safe operating practices, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all experienced operators receive annual refresher training on operating procedures.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nPractices and procedures have been developed to ensure process controls, pumps and compressors, pressure relief vessels, piping systems and emergency systems are operating properly. The practices/procedures include the performance of mechanical system inspections and tests to ensure proper equipment operation and the performance of preventative maintenance. Inspection and test findings are reported to designated management personnel and corrective measures are implemented, as required, to address any identified issues in a timely manner. Maintenance personnel receive training on process operations, equipment and systems maintenance procedures, emergency response, and work practice safety.\r\n\r\nWork Practice Safety:\r\nWork practices, including entry and exit control, equipment lockout/tagout procedures (for the isolation of energy sources when required), hazardous material management procedure, hot work program, and confined space entry programs, are followed to ensure safe working conditions.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nAll incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire or explosion, toxic gas release, property damaged (major), environmental impact, or personal injury are promptly investigated to determine the cause of the incident, evaluate response measures, and prevent future recurrence.
