The chemical manufacturing facility has 251 employees as of November 1, 2016. UF6 is the first stage of the uranium enrichment process for nuclear energy. \u00a0From MTW, UF6 is sent to an enrichment facility and then to a fuel fabrication facility before it can be used as fuel in a nuclear power production capacity.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOne of the materials used by the facility is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (AHF), which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances. MTW 's storage and use of Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride exceeds the specified threshold of 1000 lbs., as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAqueous ammonia (AqNH3, 29% Conc), which is on the RMP Rules list of regu"

MTW's storage and use of Anhydrous Ammonia exceeds the specified threshold of 20,000 lbs., as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.\r\n\u00a0\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for MTW:\r\n\u00a0\r\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\u00a0\r\nIt is the policy of MTW to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and aqueous ammonia involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community.\r\n\u00a0\r\n2) Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled:\r\n\u00a0\r\nMTW produces uranium hexafluoride, which is sold to offsite customers. The facility operates continuously to produce uranium hexafluoride. In the production process, MTW uses the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (AHF)\r\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is stored in railroad tank cars and is fed"

      "SummaryText": "directly to the production facility.  Each tank car has an inventory of approximately 176,000 lbs.  Two tank cars may be connected to the system, but generally only one is actively supplying anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at any one time.  Only 7 tank cars can be within the plant fence line at any one time.  An additional 8 tank cars may be positioned outside the plant on the railroad spur.  Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used in the manufacture of fluorine gas and the conversion of uranium dioxide (UO2) to uranium tetrafluoride (UF4).\r\n\u00a0\r\n- Aqueous Ammonia (AqNH3, 29% Conc)\r\nAqueous ammonia is stored in the tank farm facilities in a storage vessel.  The storage tank can hold an administrative maximum inventory of 99,461 lbs of AqNH3.  Aqueous ammonia is used in the Wet Process operational area as a reactant for recovering uranium from scrubbing solutions in order to feed the material back into the UF6 process.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe general accident prevention for a Program 3 RMP facility is very comprehensive, consisting of twelve elements. These elements are part of Occupational Safety and Health Act - Process Safety Management Regulations (OSHA 1910.119). The general accident prevention elements are as follows.\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n- Management of Change\r\n- Pre-Startup Review\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Employee Participation\r\n- Hot Work Permits\r\n- Contractors\r\n\u00a0\r\nMTW uses its Management of Change (MOC) process to assure plant compliance with many of the elements of OSHA 1910.119. Any plant process change requires the written approval of Safety, Occupational Health, Environmental, Health Physics, Production, and Maintenance organizations including upper management. During the MOC review of a process change, actions required for compliance with regulatory requirements"

These measures have been developed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from events that may arise during facility operations, including fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials to air, soil, or surface water. MTW's ERP has been developed to facilitate the rapid, orderly assembly of plant personnel and to activate trained Emergency Response personnel to assist in personnel rescue and controlling and containing an emergency condition on-site.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe provisions of the ERP and its supporting procedures have been developed to provide an appropriate means of detection and response for multiple industrial incidents and natural disasters, including those described in the MTW Risk Management Plan and the Honeywell Safety Demonstration Report for Renewal of Source Materials License SUB-526. This plan is intended to be fully consistent with the multiple regulatory requirements that apply to activities at the plant, including 10 CFR 40.31(j) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q). The MTW maintains a separate RCRA Contingency Plan that has been developed to implement the requirements of 40 CFR 264 and related regulations. The provisions of the RCRA Contingency Plan augment and complement the provisions of the ERP.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe ERP addresses the following subjects:\r\n- Pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside agencies\r\n- Personnel roles, lines of authority, training and communication\r\n- Emergency prevention, recognition, and classification\r\n- Safe distances and places of refuge\r\n- Site security and control\r\n- Evacuation routes and procedures\r\n- Decontamination\r\n- Emergency medical treatment and first aid\r\n- Emergency ale"
