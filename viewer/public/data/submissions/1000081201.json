(also \"MPC\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  MPC has posted Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting any hazardous chemical accident or release and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  MPC has also posted its Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as its Emergency Escape Mask  Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.  All MPC service vehicles contain Emergency Response Documents, which is a quick reference for employees on what to do in various potential emergency and/or release situations.  MPC also has an emergency action plan contained in section N of the OSHA PSM. \n\n\n\nMPC's Emergency Action Plan is contained within its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available safety goggles, gloves and escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A verbal notification system and a chlorine "

A posted Emergency Response Contact list identifies who to call in the event of a release, which includes calling 911.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nMPC provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools.  The facility operates five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, and 50 weeks per year.\n\n\n\nThe Fill Facility Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\n\n\nThe Fill Facility chlorine storage areas are not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The Fill Facility Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations. \n\n\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months, for obvious reasons, are the busiest swim times of the year.  Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. MPC stores a maximum of 24,000 pounds of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of 7 one-ton containers, 400 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process.   The Federal threshold of 2,500 pounds is exceeded as the maximum on site at any given time is 24,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n\n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The "

The one-ton containers are placed on a rail system in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location on the rail system and are secured to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained or secured in place in an upright position.  The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 8, one-ton containers and 400 each twenty pound cylinders for a total of 24,000 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 24,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed into a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \n\n\n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT approved cylinders, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the pan scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption system.\n\n\n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to the lower (liquid level) angle valve on the operating one-ton container and an e"

Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the pan scale reaching the desired value, the cylinder valve is closed, the ton supply of chlorine is closed, and the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine absorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging system.\n\n\n\nThe packaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container.  Only a small amount of residual chlorine remains in the lines after fill to be routed to the caustic scrubber.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\n\n\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written filling procedures exist and are followed.  The entire system is evacuated and the one-ton container liquid valve is shut during non-working hours.  Filling personnel have available escape masks.  The following emergency equipment is available at the fill yard:  an emergency drench shower/eyewash unit; respirator and escape mask; safety goggles; safety gloves; ammonia to detect leaks; fire extinguisher; first aid kit; and valve caps and valve protectors/bonnets on the full, stored ton containers. \n\n\n\n3.

The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitment to an accidental release prevention program. \n\n\n\nMPC has a maintenance and inspection program for equipment, including hydro testing of all small service cylinders every five (5) years, and pH testing of caustic in the absorption scrubber. Equipment is continuously inspected for maintenance and upkeep and those inspections are documented.  The specific safe work processes in place at MPC's facility are detailed in the PSM.  \n\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release of chlorine requiring evacuation of the immediate area, the emergency action plan is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility to an assembly location and await the arrival of local emergency responders, and to also notify nearby neighbors to evacuate the area to a place downwind of the release.  MPC's Emergency Action Plan is maintained in the office. \n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMPC's Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) plan was recently updated and minor changes were recommended and will be implemented.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system."
