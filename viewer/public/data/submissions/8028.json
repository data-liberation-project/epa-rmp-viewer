In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nFIVE COUNTY AG SERVICES  MISSION states \"to provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public\".  In order to fulfill this mission, FIVE COUNTY  AG SERVICES provides a corporate Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety  and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local refulations are covered.  The field supervisors require a timely written response with the completion date of all recomendations resulting from the audits.\n\nEach location has a \"site safety coordinator\" as an extension of the EHS group.  These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required refulatory record keeping, conduct regular safety meetings, conduct regular employee training, and act as the location's contact with the corporate EHS group.  The site safety coordinator acts as the location's emergency contact.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by TRUCK and RAIL, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower cust"

      "SummaryText": "omers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately 26- 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and 10- 1,500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 194,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 1-stationary 30,000 gallon storage tank on site.  The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tank is 142,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia may be stored temporarily in up to 1 rail car. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that may be stored in a rail car is 160,000 pounds.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity is 490,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 142,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 142,000 pounds  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that this industry has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from any distribution facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility WOULD NOT reach and end point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 27,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance from po"

It should be noted  the industry  has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICA-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards, OSHA (29 CFR 1910. 111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves and manual shutoffs.  The load-out risers used for  the purpose of filling the nurse taniks are protected by excess flow valves to to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur Ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anyhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, porperty or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off-site, as defined by the RMP regulation\n\nFollowing is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at our site for the five years prior to June 1999:\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire deprtment and request tha"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and  coordinated with our LEPC.\n\niN ADDITION, five county ag services  has an Emergency Response and contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA ( 29 cfr 1910.38 AND 1910.1200). The plan includes provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordiantion.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures.  We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment.\n\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN, PROGRAM 2, ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable evaluation and by actual knowledge of the facility and process, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------    ------------------------------------------------------------------SIGNATURE                                                                  NAME (PRINTED)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------    -------------------------------------------------------------------\nTITLE                                                                            DATE"
