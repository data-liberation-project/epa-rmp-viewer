This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n1.3.9.  Safe Work Practices\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division has safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit process and procedure to control welding and other hot work activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n1.3.10.  Management of Change\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n1.3.11.

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Ohio Refining Division is coordinated with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response effort"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Ohio Refining Division has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, the Ohio Refining Division conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n \n1.7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOhio Refining Division constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program that encourages workers to submit safety suggestions.  The Ohio Refining Division resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned during the next 5 years:\n*  Implement minor hardware changes resulting from PHA action items.\n*  Continuous improvement for personnel training programs.\n*  Continuous improvement for operating and maintenance procedures.\n*  Continuous improvement for MOC and PSSR programs"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n1.3.12.  Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ohio Refining Division periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being followed.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.
