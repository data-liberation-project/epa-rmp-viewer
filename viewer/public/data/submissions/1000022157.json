As part of this commitment, the Ohio Refining Division has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Ohio Refining Division under the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit risk management plan (RMPlan) information describing the risk management program at the Ohio Refining Division.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n1.1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division is committed to the safety of Ohio Refining Division workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Ohio Refining Division implements controls designed to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Ohio Refining Division evaluates each situation, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, requests assistance from outside emergency responders including the local fire department to help control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Deputy Assistant Secretary to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Deputy Assistant Secretary.  Those relationships are depicted on the Division organization chart maintained by the Deputy Assistant Secretary's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Division's Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.  The division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Environment Safety and Security Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other Division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis with responsibilities for carrying out their respective parts.\n\n1.2.  The MPC LP Ohio Refining Division Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division is a refinery and petroleum products facility located in Canton, Ohio.  The refinery uses crude petroleum as the feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, asphalt, sulfur, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Some of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  In total, the Ohio Refining Division has thirteen process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.

Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nThe Ohio Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team has considered offsite effects of potential accidental releases as part of all PHAs conducted since 1996.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety featu"

Once again, the PHA team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n1.3.4.  Operating Procedures\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used to safely complete tasks by operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n1.3.5.  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ohio Refining Division has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process unit.
