These regulations and guidance are contained in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  The RMP rule requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan which:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tidentifies the potential effects of a chemical accident,\r\n\u00bf\tidentifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident, and\r\n\u00bf\tspells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur.\r\n\r\nOxy Permian (OXY) owns and operates the Indian Basin Gas Plant (IBGP), a natural gas processing plant located in Eddy County, Lakewood City, New Mexico.  . This report provides the supporting documentation for the 5 year RMP renewal submittal.\r\n\r\nThe IBGP extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs), produces sweet residue gas for sales, and manufactures sweet fuel gas for plant and field consumption. The plant processes several regulated flammable substances in excess of their threshold quantities (e.g. methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane).  These substances are listed in Tables 3-4 of the 40 CFR 68.130. This facility does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68.130.\r\n\r\nFor the assessed worst-case release scenario, the single vessel with the greatest amount held is the NGL Storage Vessel (PV-14.32-1902).  Considering the current administrative controls in place, this vessel's maximum held inventory is 143,200 pounds.  The following table contains a summary of the mixture composition for the maximum held inventory.\r\n\r\nReleased Inventory\r\nMaterial\tPounds\r\nMethane\t235\r\nEthane\t52,438\r\nPropane\t45,399\r\ni-Butane\t8,278\r\nn-Butane\t17,873\r\ni-Pentane\t5,542\r\nn-Pentane\t5,431\r\nHexane\t8,001\r\nTotal:\t143,198\r\n\r\nThe endpoint distance for the assessed worst-case release scenario is less than the distance to public recep"

      "SummaryText": "tor.\r\n\r\nFor the last 5 years, the IBGP has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any of the offsite:\r\no\tDeath;\r\no\tInjury; or\r\no\tResponse or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.\r\n\r\nEmergency response drills have been coordinated with local planning and response organizations.\r\n\r\nIBGP is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  As such, the facility has a PSM program that includes all 14 elements of PSM.  The facility has a mechanical integrity program which includes documenting inspections, maintenance and testing of all covered equipment. Through this and other practices (e.g. Management of Change, Safe Work Permit, Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews, Training), IBGP works towards preventing accidental releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nIBGP has a written emergency response plan that includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of the regulated substances present at the facility.  It also includes information on how to contact the public and local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nRegarding safety, IBGP is constantly looking for continuous improvement opportunities.\r\nRMP Requirements\r\nAll facilities subject to the RMP rule must complete a hazard assessment analysis for the regulated chemical. In addition, the recent (5 - year) accident history and emergency response plan must be reviewed. Based on these assessments, the facility will be classified within one of three program levels.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 1 - no offsite receptor impacted (potentially and in last five years)\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 2 - offsite impacts and not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard (OSHA PSM)\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 3 - offsite impacts and subject to OSHA PSM\r\n\r\nAll programs require submittal of an RMP.

      "SummaryText": "Program 2 and 3 processes, two additional tasks are required:  a release prevention program and an emergency response program. The following sections provide a brief summary of the hazard assessment, accident history, prevention program, emergency response, and subsequent RMP program level determination for the IBGP facility.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment\r\nThe storage tanks area was identified as having the largest potential impact, should a release / spill occur. The rupture of one tank was identified to be the worst-case release scenario since it will result in the largest spill surface area. Simultaneous rupture of the two tanks is not required within the scope of the hazard assessment, as these are totally separate vessels, and the rupture of one tank would not facilitate the rupture of the other tank. For the worst-case release scenario, the maximum distance to the level of concern is 0.4 miles. \r\n\r\nReceptors Impacted\r\nOnce the impact distance of the worst-case release scenario is examined, the impact on off-site receptors must be considered. If public receptors or environmental receptors are impacted, additional analysis is required. The distance from the storage tanks to the fence line is approximately 185 ft. (0.04 miles). Therefore, the level of concern (0.4 miles) extends past the fence line to off-site locations, and any unrestricted areas within this region must be evaluated to determine if public or environmental receptors are impacted. There are no environmental receptors within the impact radius. \r\n\r\nAccident History\r\nThere are no accidents to report for either the five year accident history (40 CFR \u00a768.42) or for determining Program 1 applicability (40 CFR \u00a768.10(b)(1)).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nA facility emergency response plan for the IBGP facility is in place and has been coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations as required by 40 CFR \u00a768.10(b)(3).\r\n\r\nProgram Level\r\nThis facility classifies as a Program Level 1 since in the case"
