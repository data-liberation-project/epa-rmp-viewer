It is Ovintiv, Inc.'s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility consists of a single 24,500-gallon tank, which is filled to a maximum of 80% capacity. The tank contains a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, isobutane, and isopentane. The facility consists of separation and dehydration equipment, condensate storage areas, and compressor buildings used for treatment and compression of gas for sale.  As part of the Monument Butte compressor station operation, the facility handles -two EPA/RMP-covered flammable substances in quantities greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The Monument Butte compressor station does not have any EPA/RMP-regulated toxic chemicals. The facility is regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 1 requirements.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  In the event of a leak or overflow, all valves associated with that portion of the system will be closed and the system shut down to prevent additional releases while response procedures are initiated.  When a spill occurs outside of the containment, or in the event of a large or catastrophic release, personnel must take the necessary precautions to contain the spill to the site.  Immediate notification to designated Ovintiv Inc personnel is mandated and is the key to effective spill and release c"

Ovintiv, Inc. employees are trained with the expectation that they will evacuate and restrict access to the facility until both the safety and exposure potentials are no longer a threat. All employees are trained to discover releases and take no further action beyond making notification.
