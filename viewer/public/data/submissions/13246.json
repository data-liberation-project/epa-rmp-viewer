Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LAAFP facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation. Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of theRMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facilities consist of two different chlorination stations and one chemical depot; the LAAFP facility, the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station, and the Van Norman Chemical Depot.

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LAAFP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The LAAFP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe three LAAFP facilities are located in the same complex adjacent to the Los Angeles Reservoir in Sylmar, California.

The 25-ton bulk tank is the largest vessel (container) on line. \n\nThe Van Norman Chemical Depot is used for storage of up to 100 unopened one-ton chlorine containers and up to 40 150-lb cylinders in addition to various other chemicals.   The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on-site.  The depot is equipped with a one-ton capacity dry medium chlorine scrubber which is activated in the event of a chlorine leak. \n\nAll three LAAFP facilities currently store and/or use chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the LAAFP facilities at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.

The evaporators vaporize the liquid in a water bath to form a superheated gas which passes through a pressure-reducing valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate.  Chlorine gas from the chlorinators is pulled by vacuum to injectors located on the downstream piping at various chlorine application points.\n\nFour chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor the railcar area, ton container storage area, chlorine pipe trench, and the chlorination room in the existing system.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine control panel in an adjacent room to the chlorination room, as well as at the operator's console in the control room. \n\nThe LAAFP control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, year round.

Additionally, all containers in the Depot are stored with their protective domes on, for safety.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the LAAFP facilities involves a failure of the 90-ton railcar and release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine, the largest vessel on-site, to the atmosphere over a 10-minute duration, regardless of how improbable this may be.  The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere was defined to be 18,000 lbs./min. No passive mitigation systems were considered in determining the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. \n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (113 deg F), a"

The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the LAAFP boundary) toxic endpoint distances. \n\nSince the LAAFP facility consists of three different chlorination processes, including two chlorination systems and a storage depot, several alternative release scenarios were considered.  All accidental releases of chlorine from the chemical depot would be mitigated by a scrubber and the toxic endpoint distance would not extend off-site.  The alternative scenario considered for the filtration plant was an event that occurred at the facility and involves a leaking railcar pressure safety valve.  A screening analysis was performed for this scenario and it was found that the toxic endpoint distance would not extend offsite for this scenario.  The final scenario evaluated was for the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet chlorination station, which indicated that a toxic endpoint distance would extend offsite.\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the f"

The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the toxic endpoint distance extends offsite but has no discernable offsite impacts.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the LAAFP facilities during the last five years. \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe DWP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements. The DWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n\n* Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n\n* Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\n* High level of training of the operators and maintenance staff.\n\n* Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, presence of chlorine detectors and alarms with remote monitoring, the use of Midland valve actuators, and the operation of a scrubber.\n\nProcess and Chemic"

This scenario can occur if a flex hose is worn or has a defect and results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine bulk tank.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The Midland valve actuators would close on the bulk tank when the chlorine detectors detect a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm. The only chlorine that would leak from the crack would be the liquid in the 80 feet of 1-inch pipeline plus the 100 pounds of chlorine in the evaporator reservoir. The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility.  It is assumed that approximately thirty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond. One passive mitigation system considered was the chlorination building structure that houses the chlorination building. Two active mitigation systems considered were the actuation of chlorine detectors and the activation of the Midland valve actuators on the bulk tank.  The amount of chlorine released inside the building was estimated at 139 lbs, at an average rate of 74.6 lbs/min for 111 seconds.\n\nThe release rate reduction from the enclosed building is estimated to be approximately 92% of the release rate from the cracked flex hose, per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiency levels for buildings storing chlorine.  The release rate for chlorine was thus estimated at 6 lbs./min.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of this scenario is highly unlikely because the flex hose is on the DWP preventive maintenance schedule.

The DWP employee training documentation files include training records for each employee assigned to operate or maintain the chlorination process.  The training ensures that the employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.  Employee training includes as a minimum the following elements:\n\n* Safety Information;\n\n* Process Technology and Process Equipment, including safety systems;\n\n* Maintenance Procedures;\n\n* Operating Procedures for the chlorine system;\n\n* RMP Program contents; and\n\n* Emergency Response Plan and Procedures.\n\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years to each employee operating the chlorination process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, DWP ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after major modifications.\n\nContractors\n\nDWP Contractor procedures specify the information required to be provided to the contractors performing work on or near the chlorination processes, the training requirements for contractor employees, and mechanism to obtain assurance from contractors that they have informed their employees of the appropriate safety rules.  DWP is required to provide information and explanations concerning the hazards and processes and obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractors safety program. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nDWP has procedures in place to ensure that a pre-startup safety review is conducted prior to starting a new covered process or prior to "

The required conditions prior to startup include:\n\n* Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n\n* Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\n\n* A PHA has been performed for any new facilities and recommendations have been resolved or implemented prior to startup;\n\n* At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met; and\n\n* Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\nThese procedures ensure that no new/significantly modified process will start-up and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review.  This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\n\nDWP operates a Mainsaver Program that generates a task order for performance of the preventive maintenance routine after a designated time past the closing of the previous task order for that maintenance.  Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.\n\nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the General Operation and Maintenance Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance checklists are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, monthly, biannual, annual, every 2 to 10 years, and as-needed basis.  These allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necess"

The procedures call for the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination processes and other areas deemed appropriate as described in the procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place prior to the issuance of the hot work permit.  The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location and specific operational requirements and is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\nDWP Management of Change (MOC) procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel prior to implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, PSI, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nDWP will certify every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements are met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.\n\nThe compliance audit will consist of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team will complete a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.
