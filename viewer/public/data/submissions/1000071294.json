      "SummaryText": "The Wise County Power Company, LLC., owned by Vistra Energy, operates an electric generating plant, Wise County Power Plant, which is located near Poolville in Wise County, Texas \n\n\n\nWise County Power Company, LLC. has two combustion turbines, which directly generate electric power, plus two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), which generate steam that is routed to a steam turbine to generate additional electric power.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of a worst-case release of a toxic chemical regulated under 112(r).  Due to the nature of the toxic chemical used and stored, the location of the facility, and the estimated worst case release, there are no residences within the radius of impact.  Therefore, this is a Program 1 RMP.   \n\n \n\n\n\nAn emergency response plan has been developed for use in the event of an ammonia release."
