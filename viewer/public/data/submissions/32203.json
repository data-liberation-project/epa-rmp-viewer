      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSusquehanna SES Risk Management Planning policy provides a unified approach to prevent accidental releases of chemicals through the integration of engineering controls, administrative controls, and administrative procedures.  All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are adhered to.  The Susquehanna SES emergency response program policy involves the preparation of response plans detailed specifically to the Susquehanna SES facility located in Berwick, PA and to the emergency response services available in the community as detailed in the Susquehanna SES Off-Site plan submitted and approved by the Luzerne County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Susquehanna SES facility, located at R.R. 1 and U.S Route 11 is a nuclear power plant.  In the production of power, hydrogen gas is used for reactor vessel intergranular stress corrosion cracking mitigation.  The hydrogen system includes a storage tank, process piping, vaporizers, and a bank of gas receivers.  All hydrogen water chemistry personnel are trained on the hydrogen system.  Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any problems and maintain the system.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes only the worst case release scenario; since the endpoint distance for the worst case did not reach the public or environmental receptors.  Therefore, no alternate case release scenario was needed.  The worst case scenario is defined by the RMP regulations which state that the worst case release must be of the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipeline for which the entire amount is released instantaneously.  The substance is assumed to vaporize resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The flammable endpoint distance dictated by the regulation is 1 psi overpressure.  A yield factor"

      "SummaryText": "of 10% of available energy released in the explosion must be used for the TNT equivalent method.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program for hydrogen is as follows:\n\n\u00b7 The hydrogen supplier maintains the hydrogen system.  They have designed preventative maintenance programs for this system in conformance with the OSHA PSM and NFPA 50B requirements.  As an added prevention measure, the supplier has continuous tank volume monitoring capability.  Therefore, the supplier can detect abnormal variations in tank volume at anytime.\n\n\u00b7 In addition to the supplier, Susquehanna SES has developed additional prevention measures for the hydrogen system.  Theses include: hydrogen water chemistry operating and testing procedures, mechanical integrity equipment reviews, and employee training programs.\n\n\u00b7 The plant was required to meet rigorous siting and design standards in accordance with the Nuclear Regulation Commission (NRC) requirements.  Additionally, the hydrogen system is fully enclosed by a fence for security purposes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of hydrogen within the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSusquehanna SES has a comprehensive emergency response plan, including an Off-Site plan that has been approved by the Luzerne County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Susquehanna SES has emergency responders trained in the Fire Brigade.  The responders are trained to handle potential releases of hydrogen.  Specific on-site reponse plans for handling releases of hydrogen exist.  There is a written notification procedure in the response plan.  Specific arrangements and agreements have been made with local offsite support organizations to provide: fire and rescue, emergency medical transportation, hospital medical treatment, and law enforcement and traffic control.\n\nA Process Hazrad Analysis (PHA) meeting the criteria of OSHA's PSM stand"

      "SummaryText": "ard 29 CFR 1910.119 was conducted for the hydrogen system.  The What-if method was used to analyze the hydrogen system.  A team consisting of safety and environmental professionals, and process engineers analyzed the system.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOver the past several years, Susquehanna SES has obtained land surrounding the site.  This land is unoccupied and used as a buffer zone between the plant operations and the community.  Susquehanna SES may continue to purchase additional land plots at their discretion, as they become available, to further increase the buffer zone."
