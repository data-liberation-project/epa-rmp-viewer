The facility was originally built in the 1960's and through expansions has increased its refrigeration system to where it has more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Sylvest Farms has implemented a Process Safety Management program to comply with OSHA regulations and the Risk Management Plan in compliance with the EPA.\n\nSylvest Farms Senior Management Commitment\n\nSylvest Farms is committed to safety and allocates resources to accomplish safety goals, for example:\n\nPurchasing safety equipment; hiring a consultant for assistance with safety and environmental matters, having full time safety and environmental managers on staff, conducting safety training for managers, supervisors and employees, training, equipping and maintaining emergency preparedness including a HAZWOPER team providing meeting area and personnel for public meetings.\n\nIn addition, the plant?s HAZWOPER team by its training, drills and other preparedness activities has built a strong reputation in the community and public response agencies such as the Montgomery, Alabama Haz-Mat / Fire Department.\n\nSylvest Farms Ammonia Refrigeration Department\n\nThe refrigeration system is operated by a trained full time refrigeration staff that includes 6 Refrigeration Technicians and 1 Refrigeration Superintendent.  The system is regularly monitored, inspected and maintained.  The refrigeration department utilizes preventative maintenance, standard operating procedures, regular and frequent inspections and safety programs.  \n\nSafety procedures include: lockout tagout, hot work permit, hazard communication, ammonia safety, respiratory protection, contractor control, opening system permits, hearing protection, fire prevention and protection, hazardous waste disposal, emergency response and maintenance procedures to ensure the safe operation of the re"

The release prevention measures and activities are detailed in the PSM program.  In addition, an ammonia refrigeration contractor is utilized to provide maintenance support, improvements and additional maintenance activities beyond the plant?s capabilities as needed.\n\nThe Process Safety Management program for the facility is comprised of these sections:\n\n1.

The Sylvest Farms, Montgomery, Alabama Process Safety Management program is structured to address future requirements also.\n\nThe PSM program includes existing procedures and practices whenever practical and appropriate.  The complete PSM program ensures comprehensive coverage of process areas handling anhydrous ammonia and application of process safety controls.\n\nThe concept of Process Safety Management has its roots in solid management practices developed in various process industries.  Management systems are a structured, systematic method to implement an identified set of activities with assigned responsibilities to achieve desired results.  The management systems combine into a PSM program providing organization and application of Sylvest Farms, Montgomery, Alabama government and industry controls, policies, practices, and procedures.\n\nPSM Process And Facility Overview\n\nSylvest Farms, Montgomery, Alabama operates an ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling.\n\nThe Sylvest Farms, Montgomery, Alabama refrigeration system is designed to provide:\n\n?operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\n?economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required and alternative fuel / energy equipment);\n?optimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilizing instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant, detection systems, inspections and alarms); and\n?consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nThe facility had one accidental release in the past five years.

These actions included installing additional piping supports where needed, respiratory protection and other PPE during valve operation, additional training for refrigeration system technicians, moving valves to the roof, implementation of an on-site HAZWOPER team, facility evacuation drills, alarms, notification procedures, coordination and emergency response planning with public HAZ-MAT response organizations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a trained and equipped ammonia haz-mat team.  The on-site haz mat team has regular re-training and drills.  The Montgomery, AL Fire Department Haz-Mat Team has observed some of the drills at the plant.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the recent hire of a Safety Director to oversee safety issues at the plant, implementing a new plant safety committee, additional drills for the Haz-Mat Team, continued training of ammonia refrigeration personnel and working with local emergency officials."
