With input from the CUPA, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aqueous ammonia storage and handling system has been identified as the only process at the facility which triggers the CalARP RMP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by Prevention Program 2 requirements.\n\nOn March 31, 2004, the amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112 ? (7) was signed. The amendment:\n\n* Requires a correction to reportable information on chemical accidents be added to the RMP within six (6) months of the date of the accident;\n\n* Requires that changes to emergency contact information be corrected within one (1) month;\n\n* Removes the requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the RMP executive summary; and\n\n* Adds three (3) RMP data elements.\n\nEPA also amended the RMP*Submit format to expand the list of possible accident causes to include uncontrolled chemical reactions.  As part of this rulemaking, EPA also clarified that the five (5) year deadline for updating RMPs that were originally filed early (i.e., submitted before June 21, 1999), is June 21, 2004, with subsequent updates due every five (5) years thereafter.  This amendment became effective on April 9, 2004 when it was published in the Federal Register.  \n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of RRI E"

To achieve this end, RRI strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nRRI implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Mandalay Generating Station is located at 393 North Harbor Boulevard in Oxnard, California at the western margin of the Oxnard Plain adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and approximately 60 miles west of Los Angeles, California (coordinates 34? 12? 26? north, 119? 15? 4? west).  The elevation of the facility is approximately 15 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake fault zones are the Malibu Coast-Santa Monica-Hollywood-Raymond Fault Zone 22 miles southeast of the site; the Oak Ridge Fault 3 miles north of the site; and the Ventura Fault 5 miles north of the site.\n\nThe station is located between a residential zone to the south (Oxnard Shores) and McGrath State Beach to the north. The main area covers approximately 60 acres and is bounded Harbor Boulevard on the east and by the Pacific Ocean on the west.  Appendix A contains site location/vicinity and overview maps.\n\nThe Mandalay Generating Station consists of two gas-fired steam turbine units, each rated at 215 MW (1990 mmBTU/hr), and one 130 MW (2510 mmBTU/hr) gas turbine peaking unit.

The ammonia is used in the SCR systems for control of NOx emissions from the boilers of Units 1 and 2. All other regulated substances onsite are in quantities below applicable thresholds.\n\n\n1.2.1 Selective Catalytic Reduction\n\nAqueous ammonia [Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) 1336-21-6], 29% concentration by weight,  with a vapor pressure of 9.1 psig at 60?F is used in the SCR system to control NOX emissions from Units 1 and 2 as Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  The SCR system reduces NOX emissions by injecting vaporized ammonia (NH3) (CAS 7664-41-7) into the boiler exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst matrix.  Ammonia, NOX, and oxygen react on the surface of the catalyst to form harmless nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  The low temperature catalyst is comprised of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) on a ceramic substrate and operates within a normal temperature range of 600?F to 750?F.  Ammonia system diagrams are contained in Appendix B.\n\n\n1.2.2  Regulated Substances\n\nAqueous ammonia is a toxic substance above the federal RMP and CalARP thresholds (19 CCR ?2770.5, Tables 1 and 3, respectively).  No regulated flammable substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities under the regulation. All quantities of other materials are also below applicable thresholds.\n\n* Aqueous ammonia, 29% by weight, 14,650 gallons (max), 32,000 pounds (max) as NH3\n\nTable 1-1 shows capacities for determination of CalARP applicability for Risk Management Planning (RMP).

VNX is a solid deposited on a ceramic honeycomb material (less than 5% in matrix), the design of which promotes interaction with the exhaust gas stream within the SCR.  As such, VNX remains within the SCR and is not released to the atmosphere. This substance, therefore, meets the definition of an article (?2735.3) and is therefore exempted from the requirements of the CalARP program as per ?2770.2(b)(3).  VNX is not federally listed under 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\n\n1.3  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nMandalay Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia in the SCR NOX reduction system.  Aqueous ammonia is a regulated substance and is used above the federal RMP and CalARP threshold quantities (TQ) therefore, RRI is subject to the RMP and CalARP requirements. The facility is coded  under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as 221112, Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation.\n\nIn accordance with the CalARP regulations and with the guidance of the Oxnard Fire Department as CUPA, it has been determined that the SCR system falls under the CalARP Prevention Program 2 requirement.   The SCR process uses an amount of aqueous ammonia that exceeds the state and federal TQ, therefore is subject to CalARP and the Federal RMP. \n\nCompliance with the CalARP comprehensive program validates the integrity of the processes which handle flammable or toxic materials.

      "SummaryText": "25531 through ?25543.3, this federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) is implemented as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThe scope of this RMP is based on the guidance of the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the city of Oxnard Fire Department, to ensure that all contemporary issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  With input from the CUPA, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aqueous ammonia storage and handling system has been identified as the only process at the facility which triggers the CalARP RMP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by Prevention Program 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nOn March 31, 2004, the amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r) (7) was signed. The amendment:\n\n\n\n* Requires a correction to reportable information on chemical accidents be added to the RMP within six (6) months of the date of the accident;\n\n\n\n* Requires that changes to emergency contact information be corrected within one (1) month;\n\n\n\n* Removes the requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the RMP executive summary; and\n\n\n\n* Adds three (3) RMP data elements.\n\n\n\nEPA also amended the RMP*Submit format to expand the list of possible accident causes to include uncontrolled chemical reactions.  As part of this rulemaking, EPA also clarified that the five (5) year deadline for updating RMPs that were originally filed early (i.e., submitted before June 21, 1999), is June 21, 2004, with subsequent updates due every five (5) years thereafter.  This amendment became effective on April 9, 2004 when it was published in the Federal Register.  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of RRI Energy (RRI) that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.

The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\n\n\nThe Mandalay Generating Station is located at 393 North Harbor Boulevard in Oxnard, California at the western margin of the Oxnard Plain adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and approximately 60 miles west of Los Angeles, California (coordinates 34? 12? 26? north, 119? 15? 4? west).  The elevation of the facility is approximately 15 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake fault zones are the Malibu Coast-Santa Monica-Hollywood-Raymond Fault Zone 22 miles southeast of the site; the Oak Ridge Fault 3 miles north of the site; and the Ventura Fault 5 miles north of the site.\n\n\n\nThe station is located between a residential zone to the south (Oxnard Shores) and McGrath State Beach to the north. The main area covers approximately 60 acres and is bounded Harbor Boulevard on the east and by the Pacific Ocean on the west.  Appendix A contains site location/vicinity and overview maps.\n\n\n\nThe Mandalay Generating Station consists of two gas-fired steam turbine units, each rated at 215 MW (1990 mmBTU/hr), and one 130 MW (2510 mmBTU/hr) gas turbine peaking unit.  Steam Units 1 and 2 are each equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems (SCR) for the control of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) emissions. \n\n\n\nThe regulat"

The ammonia is used in the SCR systems for control of NOx emissions from the boilers of Units 1 and 2. All other regulated substances onsite are in quantities below applicable thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Selective Catalytic Reduction\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia [Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) 1336-21-6], 29% concentration by weight,  with a vapor pressure of 9.1 psig at 60?F is used in the SCR system to control NOX emissions from Units 1 and 2 as Best Available Control Technology (BACT).  The SCR system reduces NOX emissions by injecting vaporized ammonia (NH3) (CAS 7664-41-7) into the boiler exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst matrix.  Ammonia, NOX, and oxygen react on the surface of the catalyst to form harmless nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  The low temperature catalyst is comprised of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) on a ceramic substrate and operates within a normal temperature range of 600?F to 750?F.  Ammonia system diagrams are contained in Appendix B.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is a toxic substance above the federal RMP and CalARP thresholds (19 CCR ?2770.5, Tables 1 and 3, respectively).  No regulated flammable substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities under the regulation. All quantities of other materials are also below applicable thresholds.\n\n\n\n* Aqueous ammonia, 29% by weight, 14,650 gallons (max), 32,000 pounds (max) as NH3\n\n\n\nTable 1-1 shows capacities for determination of CalARP applicability for Risk Management Planning (RMP). As shown below, the aqueous ammonia quantity on site exceeds CalARP and federal RMP thresholds. Appendix C contains MSDS documents for aqueous ammonia.  For the mass determination, a specific gravity of 0.8974 was used to calculate a density of 7.48 pounds per gallon for the 29% ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution. \n\n\n\nTable 1-1.  RMP / CalA"

VNX is a solid deposited on a ceramic honeycomb material (less than 5% in matrix), the design of which promotes interaction with the exhaust gas stream within the SCR.  As such, VNX remains within the SCR and is not released to the atmosphere. This substance, therefore, meets the definition of an article (?2735.3) and is therefore exempted from the requirements of the CalARP program as per ?2770.2(b)(3).  VNX is not federally listed under 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nMandalay Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia in the SCR NOX reduction system.  Aqueous ammonia is a regulated substance and is used above the federal RMP and CalARP threshold quantities (TQ) therefore, RRI is subject to the RMP and CalARP requirements. The facility is coded  under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as 221112, Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the CalARP regulations and with the guidance of the Oxnard Fire Department as CUPA, it has been determined that the SCR system falls under the CalARP Prevention Program 2 requirement.   The SCR process uses an amount of aqueous ammonia that exceeds the state and federal TQ, therefore is subject to CalARP and the Federal RMP. \n\n\n\nCompliance with the CalARP comprehensive program validates the integrity of the processes which handle flammable or toxic materials.  The objective of the regulation is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, RRI has developed the necessary expertise, experien"
