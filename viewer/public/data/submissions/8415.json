SPC has performed AIChE Guide-Word HAZOPS and analyzed Offsite Consequences using the AFTOX and ALOHA air dispersion models and evaluated the following scenarios:\n\n* Human error\n* Vandalism/sabotage\n* Mechanical / electrical failure\n* Physical damage\n* Natural disaster\n* Fire / explosion.\n\nThe USEPA recommended Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) is the release of ammonia at the storage tank through a < inch orifice.  The quantities of ammonia associated with this ARS are expected to extend beyond the property boundaries given the ARS meteorological conditions recommended in the USEPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nUse of the look-up tables provided in the USEPA Ammonia Guidance Document for the recommended Alternative Release-Scenario (10,000 lb. release, 10-minute duration, 3.0 meters per secon"
