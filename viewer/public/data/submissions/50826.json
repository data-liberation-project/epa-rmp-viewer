      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nGold Kist North Carolina Division\nSiler City, NC Processing Plant\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.  Management of the Gold Kist NC Processing Plant in Siler City is committed to employee and public safety and environmental protection.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which includes equipment design and installation, operation and maintenance procedures, and employee training.  Our employees implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, trained emergency response personnel are present to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED.  GK-Siler City is a poultry processing plant that uses ammonia in its operations.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to ensure wholesome products.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.  This information is available for review at the facility.\n\n4.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.  The GK-Siler City facility is in compliance with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR part 68.  The refrigeration system is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe intent of the employee participation program is to require employers to involve employees in each element of the PSM program.  PSM will not be effective without the involvement of the employees and/or their representatives.  They cannot be involved if they?re not aware and informed.\n\nPSM should not be an imposed system from management but should involve employees in all parts of the process.  Participation by non-technical em"

      "SummaryText": "ployees may make significant contributions toward a safety workplace.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDetailed records of safety information that describe chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all operations are maintained at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nPersonnel with engineering and process expertise conduct the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with our operations are identified and controlled efficiently.  Findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.  The methodology used to perform these analyses is the What If / Checklist method.  The PHA is validated every five years.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures are in place to ensure safe plant operations.  The operating procedures provide employees involved in the operation of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safely perform their tasks in a consistent manner.  Written operating procedures must be developed for each operating phase involving the ammonia refrigeration system,  including start-up, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The operating procedures must address operating limits, including the consequences of deviations, steps to correct and/or avoid deviations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures must be updated as often as necessary to reflect current operating practices including changes in technology, equipment and facility changes.\n\nOperator Training\nEmployees and contractors who actually operate the system must understand how to do so.  The training guideline describes the process by which personnel should operate and supervise the ammonia refrigeration system may be trained and qualified.  \nThe employer?s training obligations are:\n\n? Initial Training\n? Refresher Training\n? Certifying Existing Ope"

      "SummaryText": "rators\n? Form of Training\n? Documentation Requirements.\n\nRefresher training is provided every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nContractors\nEmployers are required to evaluate a contract employer?s safety program, inform contract employers of certain hazards and the applicable portions of the emergency action plan, log contract employee injuries occurring during work involved in the covered process, evaluate the contractor?s safety performance while working on-site, and control contract employee access to the process.  Contract employers must provide employee training and information concerning hazards, ensure that employees follow the employer?s safety rules, and alert the employer to hazards discovered during work or presented by the work the contract employees are performing.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nThe purpose for the pre-startup safety review is to help ensure that certain important issues have been addressed before ammonia is loaded into the system.  This helps ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and operational.  Pre-Startup safety reviews are required by the standard for all new facilities, and for all facility modifications that result in a change to the process safety information.  They may also be beneficial to use after a prolonged shutdown.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe purpose of a mechanical integrity (MI) program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided, and, if necessary, properly contained.  The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than ?breakdown? maintenance.  A comprehensive maintenance and MI program covers the specific pieces of equipment and system components that are to be maintained, the planned maintenance and quality assurance activities to be performed, inspection and testing procedures, training procedures, and documentation instructions.\n\nHot Work Permit\nThe purpose of the hot work permit procedure is to ensure that employees, contractors and company prop"

The management of change procedures should be used as the gatekeeper of the PSM program to ensure that as changes are made, the facility?s PSM program is modified as needed.\n\nChanges other than replacements that satisfy design specification, or replacements in kind, must go under management of change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe purpose of investigating serious incidents and near-misses is to understand what happened (or could have happened) and then to prevent any recurrence of similar incidents, thereby improving the safety of the process.  An incident investigation must be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near-miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\nThe employer must develop and implement an emergency action plan.  The plan should contain essential steps necessary to initiate, conduct, and terminate an emergency response action.  The plan is updated as needed to reflect operation changes.  All emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and service to ensure proper operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years to determine compliance with the provisions of the PSM/RMP regulations.  Any corrective actions identified in the audit are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nTrade Secrets\nThe employer must make the information that is necessary to comply with sections (d), (e), (f), (m), (n), and (o) of the PSM Stand"
