The facility produces methanol from natural gas by reforming the gas with steam and then converting and distilling the resulting gas mixture to produce pure methanol.  The facility contains the following regulated substances: methane, and hydrogen.  The final product, pure methanol, is stored in dedicated tanks before being transferred to loading facilities.\n\n\n\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and it was determined that the facility's processes render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Specifically, the Geismar 1 process contains approximately 13,000 pounds of a NFPA-4 flammable mixture.  Moreover, the processes render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, the facility is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to RMP Prevention Program elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, and are designed to further enhance the facility's existing safety programs and procedures.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nMethanex views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  Refer to Section 7 of the RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the facility's OS"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall ERP is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., sheriff's department) to facilitate notification of the public and receive a quick response.  \n\n\n\nTypes of RMP site-specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, process area detectors);\n\n-R"
