      "SummaryText": "Smith Dairy Products Company ? Milk Processing produces fluid dairy products (well cows produce the products we enhance them). Our processes involve juices, cottage cheese, milk, dips, and smaller milk packages consumed by own children in school everyday.\n\nOur products are cooled by our ammonia refrigeration system. Cold product tastes better and lasts longer.\n\nThis facility is a food processing plant that runs a continuous operation. The regulated substance under the RMP Rule is Anhydrous Ammonia which is used in the refrigeration system. The process is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas. \n\nOur system operates in a ?Carnot? cycle. The ammonia is cooled, warmed, and cooled again. The ammonia absorbs heat from the product and moves it to the outside. Ammonia is not consumed in the process. Our system contains over 10,000 pounds the RMP threshold for ammonia.\n\n\nAmmonia can be hazardous. The ammonia used in our system is very similar to the household ammonia used in everyday cleaners. Just highly concentrated. \n\nPermissible Exposure Limit  25 PPM for 8 hours\nShort Term Exposure Limit  35 PPM for 15 minutes\nImmediately Dangerous to Life or Health  300 PPM\nInhalation Hazard  1,000 PPM\nSkin Absorption Hazard  10,000 PPM\nLower Explosive Limit  16%\nUpper Explosive Limit  25%\nEPA Toxic Endpoint  200 PPM\nDOT Classification:  Non flammable gas\nUnited Nations Number:  UN 1005\n\nWorst case Scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe worst case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's \"RMP COMP.\n\nThis release would be from our high pressure receiver.\n\nAffected within this radius are several schools, a hospital, a city park, residential, retail, and industrial areas. \n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance. This involves the leak of a vessel.

      "SummaryText": "cy Response Policies:\n\nSmith Dairy has established an in house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER'. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Smith Dairy has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nSmith Dairy has trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response ?29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will access each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Smith Dairy has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a release. Smith Dairy has purchased Level B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the in house HAZMAT team. This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nDuring the last five year period we have had several minor leaks resulting mainly in odors around a valve or component. All of which are easily handles by our expert maintenance staff. One incident involves the release of 385 pounds of ammonia. This is equal to approximately 1/6 of a pup tank. (pup tanks are the white pill shaped tanks commonly used by farmers. This leak "

      "SummaryText": "was the result of a faulty valve.\n\nIn the last few months we have added a PSM / RMP Specialist to our staff. Dedicated to compliance and safety issues. We continue to improve our programs when deficiencies are found. Since January of this year (2006) we have completely revamped our Process Safety and Risk Management Programs.\n\nSmith Dairy reported two releases in the last five years, EPA spill # 0501-85-0238 and Spill # 0502-85-0789.\nOn January 7th 2005 we had reported an accidental release (0501-85-238) at approximately 9:30 am; we had lost approximately 50 lbs of ammonia. Which was voluntairly reported.\nOn February 8th 2005 we had reported an accidental release (0502-85-0789) at approximately 3:22 pm; we had lost approximately 375 lbs of ammonia. Which was reported because it was over 100 pounds.\n\nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, testing and inspection programs Smith Dairy has established a history of safe operation and that community emergency action plans are current and training with community services is done for a safe response in the event of an accidental release.\n\nWhat does the future hold? Milk, Chip dip, cottage cheese and maybe a few other surprises (anyone like eggnog?)! As well as some safety changes. Our review of our processes continues. We are currently concentrating on site security as well as mechanical integrity. Employee participation continues to be a source of emprovement. Though its hard to improve on employee participation when we have the greatest associates in the world!"
