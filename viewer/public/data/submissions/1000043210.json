The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Coffeyville Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hydrogen Sulfide, sulfur dioxide and ammonia sensors with audible alarms.\r\n2. High pressure and low pressure sensors.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\r\n2. Excess flow check valves designed to plug the outlet if outflow reaches equivalent of 90 lbs/min.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\r\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\r\n3.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

The goal of each investigation will be to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports will be maintained for five years.\r\n\r\nAn investigation team will be established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.

Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.

The basic aspects of this program are to include:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 training; \r\nA\u00b7 developing written procedures; \r\nA\u00b7 performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; \r\nA\u00b7  correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and, \r\nA\u00b7 applying quality assurance measures.  \r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on \r\n\r\nA\u00b7 an overview of the process; \r\nA\u00b7 safety and health hazards;\r\nA\u00b7 applicable maintenance procedures;\r\nA\u00b7 emergency response plans; and\r\nA\u00b7 applicable safe work practi"

      "SummaryText": "Coffeyville Facility Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Coffeyville Facility (Facility) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in Montgomery County on N. Laurel St. in Coffeyville, Kansas.  The Facility is outside of the Coffeyville city limits located next to the Farmland Refinery.\r\n\r\nThe Facility produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications.  Production at the Facility consists of ammonium thiosulfate, ammonium bisulfite, potassium thiosulfate,  and molten sulfur.  \r\n\r\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment\r\n\r\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities - anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe Coffeyville Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Coffeyville Facility.  The processes at the pla"

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).

Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\r\n\r\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets and Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS).  \r\n\r\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
