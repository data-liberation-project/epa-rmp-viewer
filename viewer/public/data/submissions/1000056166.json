To perform the required offsite consequence analyses for other substances we have used.

We use anhydrous ammonia at this facility in a closed loop refrigeration system. We have recently completed the required 5 year review and update of our program and registration. Recent improvements to the facility installed originally in the late 80's include a water filled diffusion tank to neutralize any unplanned release from the facility safety relief valves and Seismic Report. \r\n\r\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Dole Berry Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of fresh strawberries.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. The calculated inventory of ammonia at our facility exceeds 10,000 lbs. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nThe worst-case"

Dole Berry Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\r\nDole Berry Company has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period at our Cold Storage facility. Any reportable release requires updating the Accident History within 6 months.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nDole Berry Company has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Facility employees will not enter a hazardous area. We have coordinated with the fire department and County resources for emergency response. We will asses the need for additional resources, evacuate as necessary, then contact county resources if necessary and perform defensive mitigation measures until help arrives. \r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is regularly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Any changes in Emergency Contact information is reported within 30 days.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We have replaced aging equipment, painted to prevent corrosion, and installed a water filled diffusion tank as mandated by the county. Proposed measures include additional barriers and warning labels, easier access to emergency controls, additional inspections of insulated equipment and pi"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia, injury, evacuation and or property damage require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nDole Berry Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
