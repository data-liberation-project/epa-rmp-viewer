The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nClinton Labs plays an active roll in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nClinton Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (BPM), on the north end of the plant, manufactures bulk drug substances for human health products.  BPM makes the intermediate form of these products and ships them to other sites for finishing into capsules or pediatric medications.  Animal Health, on the south end of the plant, manufactures feed additives and other animal health products.  These products are finished and packaged on site for worldwide delivery to customers.  The third functional area, site services, is located primarily in the center of the plant, with other buildings throughout the plant. Services provided include: steam, "

The facility has applied for, but not received, a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Clinton Labs in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations: \n\nTOXICS:  anhydrous ammonia, chlorine\n\nFLAMMABLES - None\n      \n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n \nThe USEPA RMP regulations mandate the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  This event is unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.\n\nThe USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Clinton Labs reported the worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario involves a release of the entire contents stored in  tank (88,000 pounds ? gas release) and could potentially affect offsite receptors.  Administrative controls, including written operating procedures, limit the amount stored in the tank to 88,000 pounds, which is approximately 52 percent of the tank capacity, to minimize the impact of a release.\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario for each toxic substance held above the threshold quantity.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  All alternative release scenarios were based on a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in 10 minutes. \n \nBased on our analysis using EPA-approved methods,"

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: \n\nClinton Labs is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\nAs a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care ? . The purpose of Responsible Care ? is to commit companies to performance improvement in health, safety, and environmental quality. The Responsible Care ? initiative is driven by the following guiding principles: \n? respond to community concerns\n? develop chemicals and products that have a safe life cycle\n? make health, safety and environment a priority for new processes\n? report hazards to employees, customers and the public\n? counsel customers on safe use, transportation and disposal of products\n? operate plants in an environmentally safe manner\n? increase knowledge of product and process safety\n? solve historical contamination problems\n? participate in government regulation development\n?"

It includes elements like employee protective actions, the emergency management organization, and implementation of a response, post incident procedures and building specific pre-emergency plans.  The plan is executed through a cooperative effort between the site?s management support team, full time emergency response teams, local law enforcement, and local emergency management. The on site emergency response capabilities include full time emergency response teams (described below), fire and spill response equipment, rescue rigging, ambulance service, and clinic. Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT NETWORK (CAN) SYSTEM\nClinton Laboratories implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996. The Community Alert Network, or CAN, is an automated phone messaging system. A message is delivered to the CAN organization via a 24 hr emergency line.  The message is then immediately broadcasted to every phone number in the Clinton Labs community database.  As most messages can be delivered within 10 minutes, this system is the quickest way to notify the community of an emergency at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS \nSite emergency response teams undergo regular training by security coordinators and officers. These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country. In an emergency situation, a member of the plant security staff becomes the incident commander. The Incident Commander directs all field response activities and makes regular reports to the management support team as the incident proceeds.  The Incident Commander and Incident Team Leaders direct the specific tactical actions of the emergency response teams, described below.
