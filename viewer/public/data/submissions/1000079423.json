This program requires facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\r\n\r\nRock Hill Utilities of Rock Hill, SC, is subject to this regulation as the owner and operator of the Lake Wylie Raw Water Pump Station.  The Raw Water Pump Station is located at 3900 Elks Park Road, Rock Hill, York County, South Carolina.  This facility is a stationary source of chlorine (a regulated substance) in excess of 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nA RMProgram has been developed to meet the intent of the regulations for this facility using Program 3. Information from the Federal Register, AWWAs Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, and EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68) were used as resources for the development of this program.\r\n\r\nThe Raw Water Pumping Station uses chlorine to generate chlorine dioxide for injection into the raw water stream.  The chlorine dioxide helps control the growth of Asiatic clam growth in the raw water transmission main.  The process includes the storage of up to three (3) 1-ton cylinders of liquid/gaseous chlorine and is located within a closed building utilizing a chlorine scrubber, vacuum feed system, instrumentation, process specific piping and connection materials.  \r\n \r\nA hazard assessment was conducted at the facility to determine the past history of accidents or releases of chlorine. Plant records and interviews with current plant personnel indicated there have been no releases of chlorine in the last five years that resulted in injury, death or property damage.  In addition, an informal survey of plant personnel and others familiar w"

These regulations are applicable to the Lake Wylie Raw Water Pump Station because chlorine stored at the facility is in excess of the EPA RMP Threshold amount of 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Raw Water Pump Station RMProgram complies with the intent of the EPA regulations by providing information to the utility employees, local emergency preparedness officials, and the affected public to minimize health and safety impacts. The program consists of:\r\n\r\na. A management plan.\r\nb. An employee participation plan.\r\nc. A hazard assessment.\r\nd. A prevention program (Program 3).\r\ne. An emergency response plan.\r\nf. Public Awareness, and \r\ng. RMPlan submittal to EPA\r\n\r\nA detailed listing of the EPA RMP regulations is not included herein; however, they are available at the EPAA\u00bfs home page: http:\\\\www.epa.gov\\swercepp\\.\r\nThe related Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rules (29 CFR 1910.119) require comprehensive management systems for the handling of these highly hazardous chemicals. Since South Carolina has itA\u00bfs own OSHA plan, the Lake Wylie Raw Water Pump Station is subject to this regulation. The existing PSM plan was developed by Wiedeman & Singleton, Inc. in July 2005.\r\n\r\n1.3 Goals and Objectives\r\nThe mission of the Raw Water Pumpng Station is to provide an adequate supply or raw water to the Cherry Road Filter Plant for potable water treatment.  This process involves the addition of certain chemicals that, if released in an uncontrolled manner, may present a risk to public health. While such incidents are rare, they have occurred at other similar facilities.  \r\n\r\nState-of-the-art methods for reducing risks"

The newer risk management techniques consist of a comprehensive management system designed to promote responsible and disciplined operation, maintenance, and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal in developing and maintaining the Lake Wylie Raw Water Pump Station RMProgram is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from the accidental release of chlorine liquid or gas. The RMProgram is not a substitute for other conventional health and safety programs.\r\n\r\nThis document will require periodic updates and modifications.  Changes in key personnel, chlorine vendors and modifications to the treatment process are among the items that require Plan modifications.  Specific items and their respective timetables for Plan modification are included herein.\r\n\r\nSeveral elements of the Risk Management Program directly or indirectly reference plans and procedures contained within other pre-existing documents (i.e., O&M manuals, Process Safety Management Plan, general safety guidelines, etc.).  This document provides a system for incorporating those items performed under separate unrelated plans into the Program.  Documentation of work completed under other programs and procedures is required in order to remain in compliance with the RMP regulations."
