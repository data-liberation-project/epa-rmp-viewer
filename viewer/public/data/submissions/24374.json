Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Bayer\r\nCorporation had sales of $10.1 billion in 2000 and is one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired Companies. The company employs 23,200 people. Bayer Corporation is investing $9 billion in capital expenditures and research and development from 2000 through the year 2004. 2000 capital investment and R&D expenditures were projected to total $1.6 billion. It is a member of the worldwide Bayer Group, a $29 billion international health care, polymers and chemicals group based in Leverkusen, Germany. The Bayer Group (BAYG.DE) stock is a component of the DAX, and is listed on multiple foreign exchanges.\r\n\r\nIn April 2000, Bayer Corporation acquired the global Polyols Business of Lyondell Chemical Company, including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, WV. Bayer Corporation did not purchase the assets at the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  In 1998, Lyondell Chemical Company acquired the assets of ARCO Chemical Company (ACC), including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  In 1989, ARCO Chemical Company purchased the Polyols Manufacturing facilities from Union Carbide Corporation, which included the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  In December 1999, Aventis was launched through the merger of  Hoechst AG and Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc S.A.  In 2001, Dow purchased Union Carbide Corporation.

Products made from these materials fill the supermarket shelves and go into automobiles, housing, clothing and other necessities that improve the quality of life by making products safer, healthier and more convenient.\r\n\r\nThe products made at our South Charleston and Institute West Virginia facilities belong to a family of chemicals called polyether polyols, and are derived from a chemical called propylene oxide, which is supplied by a Lyondell plant on the Gulf Coast. Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat\r\ncushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels. Nearly two-thirds of all the auto seats in the U.S. today are made using the Bayer Corporation polyols products from the Kanawha Valley. Other polyols products we make here are used by our customers for applications as diverse as roof coatings, varnishes, roller blade wheels, and bowling balls.  All of the products are shipped to customers in other states or are exported to Europe, Asia, and South America.\r\n\r\nAnother product from our South Charleston and Institute West Virginia facilities is technology.

The American Chemistry Council (ACC) was formerly called the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  Since 1990, emissions of hazardous chemicals to the air from the Bayer Corporation South Charleston and Institute West Virginia facilities have been reduced by over 90% through improving processes and eliminating inefficient operations.  We have also made continuous improvements in our safety performance every year and rank among the industry leaders in this important aspect.  It is a policy of Bayer Corporation to establish goals for continuous improvement in the areas of health, safety, and the environment based on sound science, risk assessment and benefit analysis, against which we will measure, audit and communicate our performance.\r\n\r\nAnother initiative for continuous improvement is called Operational Excellence.  Operational Excellence was formerly called Manufacturing Excellence under Lyondell Chemical Company and ARCO Chemical Company.  Operational Excellence, based on the Manufacturing Excellence Program launched in 1991 by ARCO Chemical Company, is a program of corporate standards and management systems which incorporates all of the Responsible Care\u00ae  Codes of Management Practices, best practices in the chemical industry, and Bayer Corporation's own rigorous management systems.

The Third Party Audit System evaluates the regulatory compliance, reliability, and liability associated with the following types of third parties:  Waste Sites, Terminals, Tollers, Key Suppliers, and Transporters.  A rigorous auditing process evaluates how well our facility is meeting the high standards of Operational Excellence.

RMP also requires covered sources to evaluate one worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario for a single chemical representing the class of flammables.  \r\n\r\nAll of these scenarios are developed using guidelines established in the RMP rule.  In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.  Only passive mitigation systems, such as those that do not require energy or action by an employee to initiate can be considered.  U.S. EPA acknowledges that these worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur, so the RMP rule also requires that companies develop alternative release scenarios based on more credible release assumptions. \r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways.  They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\r\n\r\nEPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance.

For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.   For flammable releases, the endpoint distance is that distance beyond which the community would be subject to a pressure wave of less than 1 psi resulting from the formation of an exploding vapor cloud.  Below this value little or no impact to the community is expected.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case and alternative case scenarios in our facility Risk Management Plans.
