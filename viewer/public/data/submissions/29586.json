Louisville Works, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental  chemical releases\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe DuPont Fluoroproducts site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown\".  We operate two processes using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  One process produces HCFC-22 with HFC-23 and hydrogen chloride as by-products.  The second process produces vinyl fluoride.  Each process uses fluorine based technology and operates independently.  We share the site with a   DuPont Dow Elastomers manufacturing facility.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst Case Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemicals on our site is the rupture of an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride railcar, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance for worst case scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Rupture of a railcar is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields.   \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios ? Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nChlorine -- A 1/8\" hole develops in a liquid chlorine pipeline.  The leak is assumed to continue for 60 minutes with no mitigation.

      "SummaryText": "ios, this toxic gas release would potentially have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.   This scenario endpoint changed with the February 2004 re-submittal due to changes in system pressure.\n\nChloroform -- A 1/2\" hole develops at the base of a storage tank releasing chloroform into a concrete dike.  The leak is assumed to continue for 15 hours until the remaining contents of the tank can be pumped to another vessel.  Using EPA's OCA Guidance for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would potentially have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.  \n\nHydrogen fluoride -- A 2\" valve on a pipe fails in the open position releasing hydrogen fluoride.  The hydrogen fluoride is detected by sensors, which activate alarms that prompt operators to remotely isolate the leak and activate water sprays within 3 minutes.  The pooled hydrogen fluoride is assumed to continue to evaporate for an additional 9 minutes.  Using EPA's OCA Guidance for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would potentially have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.  This scenario endpoint changed with the February 2004 re-submittal due to changes in the process resulting in a lower system operating pressure.\n\nWorst Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the flammable chemicals involves the rupture of a 1,1 difluoroethane storage sphere, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed. This release, if ignited,  would have an offsite impact on other industry and residential populations as determined by the use of EPA's OCA Guidance.  Rupture of the sphere is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design and maintenance of the sphere.  Additionally, ignition sources in the area of the sphere are strictly controlled.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n1,1 "

These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases and help achieve that goal.\n\n5.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past 5 years, we have had no accidental release of an EPA RMP covered material that involved onsite or offsite impact, as defined by the EPA RMP rule mandated by the CAA section 112(r).\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nIn order to promptly respond to emergencies, it is essential to detect such situations quickly.  In addition to regular patrols and process monitoring by trained operating personnel, we employ remote sensors for chlorine and hydrogen fluoride and closed-circuit television monitoring of the manufacturing area.  We have on-site alarm and public address systems to alert and inform personnel of an emergency situation.  All of our operating personnel are trained as HAZMAT technicians according to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120.  Emergency response team members receive additional training in capping, patching, plugging, and other techniques for stopping leaks.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
