A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant, which contains chlorine, classified as a Regulated Substance (RS).  This request was made in March 1997 pursuant to California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  As required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68, an RMP for this plant has been filed with USEPA.\r\nThis Risk Management Plan identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RSs) handled at this facility in excess of California threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nIt is the policy of the City that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City has gathe"

The RS used at the E. A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant and considered in this RMP is chlorine.\r\nAdministrative Controls\r\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include the City's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\r\nMitigation Measures\r\nPassive mitigation was considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario, since the chlorine process is contained in a building.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case was the response of properly trained and equipped First Responders applying a Type B repair kit device within 60 minutes.\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Programs\r\nGeneral accident release prevention programs instituted by the City are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  The City maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, and nume"

These include, among other items, installing automatic shut off valves at the ton containers and installing a leak scrubber.\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at the E. A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant within the past five years meeting the criteria stated in the CalARP regulations.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe City's Emergency response program applicable to chlorine consists of First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies in accordance with written Emergency Response procedures.  Personnel assigned as First Responders all have current HAZWOPER certifications and personal protective equipment training and fit testing.  The chlorine emergency response program has been coordinated with Sacramento County HMD.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analyses and program audits which the City committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of Process Hazard Analyses, Management of Change reviews, and audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
