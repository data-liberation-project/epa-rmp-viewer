These DuPont Corporate policies can be summarized as follows:\n- All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable\n- The Goal is Zero - Zero Incidents Period\n- All employees and contractors are responsible for their individual safety\n\nThe Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At the El Dorado Plant, the policies will be implemented through the Standard Operating Procedures, Process Technology Descriptions, Process Hazards Reviews, Training Procedures, Compliance Audits, Safe Work Practises, and Management of Change Procedures.  These procedures are provided in hard copy form to all employees.  Employee Involvement Policies encourage improvement ideas from all employees and provide for employee participation in all aspects of Accident Prevention Activities.  \n\nPrevention Programs dealing with Maintenance and Contractor Safety are provided by Service Level Agreements (SLA) with the site landlord, Great Lakes Chemical, and are described by their procedures.  Emergency Response is also provided via SLA and is described in the sitewide Emergency response Procedures.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe DuPont El Dorado Plant consists of process equipment located on 8.8 acres of land leased from the Great Lakes Chemical at their South Plant Site.  The Great Lakes Chemical South Plant Site is a total of 430 acres located in Union County, south of the town of El Dorado, AR.
