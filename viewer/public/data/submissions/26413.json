The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having off-site consequence would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\nSBR has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as references by experienced operators and for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\nSBR's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.  Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \n\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, depending upon requirements. \n\n4.5  Management of Change\nA Management of Change (MOC) review is required for modifications to f"

The requirements for Management of Change are documented in a written procedure.  Management of Change information is kept for the life of the process unit.\n\n4.6  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional assurance that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review also verifies that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nPre-startup reviews are goverened by a written Pre-Startup Safety review procedure and covers a variety or issues, including:\n* construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n* safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\n* for new facilities, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before start-up;\n* modified facilities have complied with MOC requirements including updating of the process safety information (e.g., piping instrument diagrams, operating procedures, etc.); \n* training of each applicable operating employee and maintenance worker has been completed.\n\n4.7  Mechanical Integrity\nSBR has established and implemented written procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment, pressure vessels and storage tanks, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.\n\nThe SBR mechanical integ"

In so doing, SBR will correct deficiencies in equipment which are outside acceptable limits (as defined by the process safety information) before further use, or in a safe and timely manner that ensures safe operation.\n\n4.8  Compliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, SBR conducts audits every three years to assure that the accident prevention program is being implemented.  The audits include an assessment of written prevention program elements, retained records (e.g., training records, completed hot work permits, etc.), and personnel interviews to assess level of implementation for the prevention program.\n\nCompliance reviews are performed by trained, expert personnel.  Audit results are communicated to affected employees and contractors, and retained for five years.  Action items or recommendation resulting from the various audits are tracked to completion through a computerized database.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\nThe SBR accident investigation program covers four types of incidents:\n* personal injury;\n* environmental release; \n* equipment damage and loss of production caused by fire, equipment failure or other circumstance; and\n* those incidents that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic event.\n\nThe goal of an investigation is to determine the facts associated with a release or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implementing regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68).\n\nThe five-year accident history provides an explanation of the factors that caused the accident, the on- and off-site impacts of the accident, and the changes made by SBR to minimize the likelihood that these accidents will occur again.\n\nSBR reviewed all incident, emergency release, and equipment breakdown reports from June 1998 through May 2002 to identify accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes that involved the impacts described above.   One incident involving a regulated substance from a covered process was identified:  a gas release involving a regulated toxic substance that resulted in an injury to an employee.  SBR substituted the regulated toxic substance with a more inherently safe substance throughout the refinery as a result of the incident.\n\nSection 6. Emergency Response Program\nSBR has established a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.  The purpose of the program is to protect workers, the public, and the environment from harm due to refinery emergencies.  The program includes procedures to provide for comprehensive emergency response through the following:\n* First aid and medical treatment\n* Emergency incidents, including fire, potential fire, hazardous materials releases, and natural disasters such as floods, winds, earthquake and electrical storms\n* Emergency evacuation and rescue\n* Notification of local, state and federal emergency response agencies and the public if an"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSBR has a comprehensive hazard identification and mitigation program to ensure process safety.  This program includes periodic process hazard analyses, investigations of near misses, and audits of processing units.

The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This RMP is being updated due to the removal of a covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.190(b)(7).  SBR removed chlorine, a covered toxic substance, from Areas 1 and 2 on January 3, 2002.\n\nRefining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  SBR also has delayed coking operations in Area 3, which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Area 3.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific regulated substances that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  Regulated substances are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.
