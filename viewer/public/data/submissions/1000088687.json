The regulated source at this facility is the anhydrous ammonia storage and delivery system, including the pre-mix tanks. Ammonia is listed as a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19 Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  It is present in quantities that exceed the threshold for EPA and California Accidental Release Prevention.\n\nActagro's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is the primary goal of Actagro's management. The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\nActagro's policy in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of ammonia is to contact local emergency agencies for assistance as well as necessary contractors needed to respond, clean up and restore facility functions to normal. Actagro adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Biola facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) and California Accidental Release Prevention programs, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) in accordance with both OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA CCR, Title 8, Section 5189, for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases. Biola's Risk Management Plan/Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Program incorporates offsite analysis with a robust PSM program that includes process safety information, pr"

The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. Preventive maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident. All elements of the RMP/PSM program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia is prevented.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidental ammonia releases from covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nActagro maintains an Emergency Action Plan, in lieu of an Emergency Response Program. The policy is to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Actagro has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by Actagro and the local authorities will decide on whether local areas will be evacuated. The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\n\nSince the Actagro facility is included in the community emergency res"

Additionally, under 29 CFR 1910.120(l)(1)(ii), employers who will evacuate their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs, and who do not permit any of their employees to assist in handling the emergency, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan complying with 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nActagro is committed to continuous efforts to improve the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia process by improving and updating our preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system. The anhydrous ammonia process is designed in accordance with good engineering practices and changes are evaluated for any potential impact on safety, health and the environment. Periodic auditing of the RMP/PSM program ensures continual improvement in safety performance and environmental stewardship at the Biola Actagro facility.\n\n"
