Executive Summary\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and\r\ndocumentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To\r\naccomplish this, POM Wonderful has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by\r\nResource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking\r\nRMP-PSM related activities.\r\n\r\n1.1 POM Wonderful, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that POM Wonderful has updated/developed their\r\nunified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and\r\nmaintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold\r\nquantities:\r\n\r\nProcess Name         Process Chemical               Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nFresh Side           Anhydrous Ammonia              45,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to\r\nprevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.\r\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We\r\nhave:\r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as"

These contractors also assist in performing the annual\r\nmechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\n1) 8/3/2009 - At approximately 11:45AM while a contractor employee was moving equipment with a forklift, a\r\n1/2 purge valve on the condenser drain drop leg was impacted, breaking the nipple at the threads and\r\nreleasing liquid ammonia. The approximate leak area was 0.0367 sq. in. During the first 5 minutes of the\r\nrelease the approximate pressure in the pipe was 135 psig. After 5 minutes, all necessary valves were isolated\r\nand the pressure dropped to 10 psig. It took approximately 25 minutes for the release to stop once the valves\r\nwere isolated. Using Equation (3) in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, it is\r\nestimated that 850 lb of ammonia were released over a 30 minute period.\r\n\r\nFurther details about resolution and follow up actions are contained in Incident Investigation report 2009-01.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nPOM Wonderful's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following\r\nrequirements:\r\nCalifornia Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nFederal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and\r\nevacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and\r\ntheir Hazardous Materials Response Team.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPOM Wonderful has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public\r\nsafety. Nevertheless, POM Wonderful continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM\r\nprogram. This has improved POM Wonderful's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and\r\ncontractors. I"

Liquid separated from the suction\r\nreturn gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels. Operation of a float switch\r\nactivated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained\r\ninto the high pressure receivers. Some of the coils (Anti-Room 2) are direct expansion coils. In those coils,\r\nhigh pressure ammonia liquid is piped directly to each coil where it passes through a solenoid valve, a hand\r\nexpansion valve, and directly into the coil. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low\r\ntemperature & pressure gas which is returned directly to the main suction accumulator via the suction main.\r\nThe facility was originally called Met-West and then later changed to Paramount Fruit. In 2007, the name\r\nchanged to POM Wonderful. The facility was built more than 20 years ago. More recently the following projects\r\nhave occurred:\r\n2004 - California Controlled Atmosphere added eight (8) new controlled atmosphere rooms\r\n2006 - California Controlled Atmosphere added two (2) new high pressure receivers\r\n2006 - California Controlled Atmosphere made modifications to the compressor oil cooling on the Fresh System\r\n2007 - California Controlled Atmosphere added a screw compressor and condenser to the Juice System\r\n2008 - California Controlled Atmosphere installed a complete computer control system on for the Juice System\r\n2009 - California Controlled Atmosphere installed a compressor, condenser, and plate and frame heat exchanger on the Juice System\r\n2010 - Ross & Sons installed a 500 hp screw compressor and ten (10) coils in the Fresh System\r\n\r\nThe systems contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or\r\npressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as\r\nevacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nPOM Wonderful has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release\r\nscenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event\r\nof an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the POM Wonderful facility is an integral part of the overall business and\r\noperates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and\r\nefficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential\r\ndanger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all\r\nprocedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of\r\nthe outside refrigeration contractors that"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors\r\nprotect themselves.\r\n\r\n1.2 Process Descriptions\r\n\r\nPOM Wonderful operates a cold storage facility that performs activities related pomegranate storage and juice\r\nproduction. The facility has two (2) ammonia systems (Fresh System and Juice System). The Fresh System\r\nprovides refrigerating capacity to seven cold rooms, two anti-rooms, a shipping area, the mechanical room, and\r\nsixteen controlled atmosphere rooms. The rooms use a combination of bunker style coils and ceiling\r\nsuspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia. Some of the ceiling suspended coils operate\r\nunder flooded conditions and some under direct expansion. The Juice System provides refrigerating capacity to\r\na shell and tube heat exchanger, a plate and frame heat exchanger, the Tank Room, and the Blend Room. A\r\ncomputer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\r\n\r\nThe Fresh System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receivers is piped through\r\nthe king solenoid valve. From there it is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a\r\nsolenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the\r\naccumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid\r\nammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The\r\nammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction\r\naccumulator in the engine room. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge\r\nfrom the compressors is sent to our"

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access\r\nto PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, POM Wonderful has also\r\nentered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, POM Wonderful now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive\r\nframework that guides safe action for POM Wonderful employees, but allows for feedback and continual\r\nimprovement.
