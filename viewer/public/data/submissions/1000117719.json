The ammonia refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid,  high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, banana ripening, and cooler storage.\n\n ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n 1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n 2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n These regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  \n\nThe following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by ADUSA Distribution LLC- Mauldin DC5 to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.\n\n The Standard Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.\n\n The Operator Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n \nThe Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.\n\n The Manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.\n\n The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.\n\n The Hot Work Permit program ensures that ADUSA Distribution LLC- Mauldin DC5 employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.\n\n The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  \n\nAlso, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  \n\nThe facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room, in the cold storage areas which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia leak.\n \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n There have been no federally reportable incidents nor any that resulted in serious injuries or offsite consequences within the last five years. The new ammonia refrigeration was built in 2024. \n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n The facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:- save lives;- minimize and avoid injuries;- protect the environment; and- minimize property damage.\n \nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. \n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \nADUSA Distribution LLC is committed to safe operations and will continue to identify opportunities to maintain and improve the operation of the ammonia refrige"
