Feed to the plant is noted to be low in H2S approximately less than 4 Parts Per Million (PPM) by volume\n\nField compressors Stations feed the facility through a 8\" and 10\" pipeline that tie into a single 16\" line at 900 psi. A single residue gas line exports the natural gas at 1,100 psi to the Residue Gas Sales Line. NGL's are sent out of the facility via pipeline to NGL Sales Line. Three 60,000-gallon NGL bullet tanks are in place but are only used when the sales line is out of service for temporary storage and will be empty in normal operations. Operations at the current rate, NGL transfer rate average  3,500 barrels a day. When the facility is up to full rates it is expected the NGL production will be approximately 11,000 barrels per day. Condensate is moved from the site via tank truck from one loading spot near the two 1,000-barrel tanks. The facility producing 800 barrels a week of stabilized condensate product at the current rate.\n\n\n\n"
