This plan involves procedures, technologies and management                \npractices to monitor and control any potential release of chlorine to the atmosphere. The action of this plan will minimize hazards and risks of any accidental chlorine release. We have implemented all aspects of 40 CFR 68.170 of the Code of Federal Regulations into this plan, so to protect the safety of our employees, public health and all agencies in our community and surrounding area (Fire, Sheriff, Police, E.M.T. and E.M.A. Personnel ). We strive to protect our community and environment from all possible hazards.\n\nThe Tifton Regional Wastewater Treatment Complex utilizes chlorine to disinfect processed effluent water\n prior to discharging this water into New River located on U.S. Highway 82 east. We also use this chlorine to treat our potable water source. We store filled 150-LB tanks and  (1) ton chlorine cylinders at this facility to be used in our treatment processes.  We are located east of US 319 north and north of US 82 East at\n80 Old Brookfield Road in Tift County.\n         \n\n\n\nWe maintain operational personnel on site 24 hours a day every day of the year with emergency personnel \non call should problems occur in maintenance and operational. Equipment is maintain and operated by personnel who are trained in all procedures, safety, operation of this equipment and respond to emergency\nProcedures if required. Operations, inspections and safety devises are checked and log on continuos \nbasis on all shifts as to maintain integrity of all units and devises. Chlorine equipment, piping, pumps and\nalarms are checked  (4) times per eight hour shift with a (3) shifts per 24 hour period.\n\n\nThe City of Ti"

There are  (2) scenarios used and defined by EPA as follows.                                                             \"Worse Case\" defined by EPA states \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as gas over  (10) minutes.\" This worse case scenario is unlikely to occur.\n\"Alternative Case\" defined by EPA states \"more likely to occur than the worse-case release.\"\n\n\nWorse case scenario for the Tifton Wastewater Treatment Complex is the failure of a  (1) ton tank\nContaining 2,000 lbs of chlorine emptying at a rate of (200) pounds per minute within a (10) minutes period. Modeling for this worse-case scenario was done using the EPA's guidance document, which this worst-case scenario is unlikely to occur. This document yielded a toxic endpoint of a (3) mile radius of the Treatment Complex with a (0.0087) mg/L.                                         \n   \n         \nAlternative case scenario for the Tifton Wastewater Treatment Complex for chlorine, which is most likely\nto occur involves failure of a flexible line connection to the intake manifold. The release rate for this scenario was modeled from EPA's guidance document. The release rate of chlorine gas of (630) pounds\nper minute for a time span of (60) minutes for a toxic endpoint of (0.2) mile radius of the Treatment\nComplex with a (0.0087) mg/L. \n                                            \n\n\nThe above cases are the downwind distances for the toxic endpoint for this regulated substance under\nEPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) Rule 112r. The above endpoint calculations were estimated using\nRMP Comp from EPD.
