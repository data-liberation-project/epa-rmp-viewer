The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Good Hope Fertilizer, INC. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utlization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 79,444 pounds in the facility's two tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are 12,000 andf 8,000 galllons.\n\n3.   The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,444 pounds, which represents the volue for the storage tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 3.5 miles.  \n\n     The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 12,000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  the distance tothe endpoint of dipersion is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regualtions relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facillities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with \nANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 19"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Titles III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response  planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Perodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
