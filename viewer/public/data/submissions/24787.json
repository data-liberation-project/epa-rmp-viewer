      "SummaryText": "Carbon disulfide is used for cellulose sponge production at the Nylonge Elyria Facility.  Storing and handling large quantities of carbon disulfide can create hazardous situations.  The Nylonge Facility takes safety obligations in storing and using carbon disulfide.  The Nylonge Elyria Facility carbon disulfide handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan (40 CFR Part 68 requirements).  Since the facility is located in the State of Ohio, the implementation of the RMP program has been delegated to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) (OAC 3745-104 requirements).  The Program requires a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n?    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n?    General facility and regulated substances information.\n?    Offsite consequence analysis results.\n?

The Nylonge Elyria Facility is a first responder.  It has trained employees to respond to carbon disulfide accidental releases.  It has developed and prepared an emergency action plan (standard 1400-3) for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The Nylonge Elyria Facility has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Nylonge Elyria Facility is located in Lorain County, at 1301 Lowell Street, approximately 40 miles west of Cleveland, Ohio.  Major roadways near the facility include Interstate 90, as well as State Routes 57 and 113.  The facility uses carbon disulfide for production of cellulose sponges.  The maximum quantity of carbon disulfide stored at any given time is either contained within one railcar, two fixed storage tanks, or multiple day tanks throughout the facility.\nRailcars transfer carbon disulfide (CS2) to the bulk storage area once every 10 weeks. The railcar volume is 20,000 gallons to 20,500 gallons; however, the volume of CS2, which is stored in the railcar, varies between 16,670 gallons and 17,130 gallons.  Two CS2 storage tanks are located in the bulk storage area.  Each tank is equipped with level switches, and level transmitters that send data to the control room.  CS2 is then transferred from the storage tank to a metering tank.  There are a total of three similar systems, each consisting of a metering tank, dissolving water tank, steeping caustic tank and a reactor.\nContainment is provided around the railcar to reduce the vaporization rate of carbon disulfide in case of a spill.  The total containment volume is 26,015 gallons.  The working volume of a railcar is 18,000 gal"

The containment is flooded with enough water to keep a ?couple of inches? of water over the entire bottom of the containment.\nThe process at the Nylonge facility uses a highly refined wood pulp as raw material, which is showered with caustic (sodium hydroxide) and fed to the reactors.  There are temperature and pressure transmitters on the reactor to keep track of the conditions inside the reactor.  Sponge manufacturing is a batch process.  The reaction is monitored.  Water is added to the reactor to make a viscous cellulose (viscose).  Bacteria absorbing CS2 is used to make sulfur or sulfuric acid.  The biological system currently uses an inert media that will not deteriorate the sulfuric acid.  No catalyst is used in the reactor.  Instead, a combination of the organic and inert media is used.\nHeating of the sponge with sulfuric acid causes the formation of toxic gases, which are removed by the scrubber.  There is also a secondary scrubber, which uses caustic and removes about 20% of the exhaust gases.  Sulfuric acid is further used in the wastewater process system.\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two carbon disulfide release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\".\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the carbon disulfide released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 50 ppm, which is the Emergency Respon"

This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Nylonge Elyria Facility involves a failure of the railcar and a release of 189,300 pounds of carbon disulfide to the atmosphere over a 10-minute duration, regardless of how improbable this may be.  The released carbon disulfide would evaporate as it falls from the railcar into the dike provided around the railcar.  This dike is filled with water to reduce the evaporation of carbon disulfide after it spills into the dike.  The carbon disulfide evaporation is reduced because it is denser than water and it will settle at the bottom of the dike.  Therefore, the carbon disulfide release rate to the atmosphere was estimated to be about 14 lbs./min.\nUSEPA and Ohio EPA regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the carbon disulfide cloud formed during the worst-case release scenario would be denser-than-air, the USEPA guidance document was used for performing the consequence analysis.  The USEPA guidance document accounted for the dense gas behavior of carbon disulfide releases.\nUSEPA and Ohio EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (104?F), and average humidity (50%) were used for the dispersion modeling analysis.

Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider ?active? mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.  In addition, the selected scenario should reach the toxic endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the hazard review.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the carbon disulfide facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there was no carbon disulfide release, which resulted in offsite (outside the Elyria facility boundary) toxic endpoint distances.\nThe scenario selected for the Elyria carbon disulfide system involves the release of carbon disulfide as a result of a crack in the transfer pipeline from the railcar to the bulk storage tank.  It is assumed that all the liquid carbon disulfide present in the 135-foot pipeline will be released and will fall to the ground in an undiked area and then evaporate.  The total quantity of carbon disulfide released during the alternative release scenario was estimated at 232 lbs.  The carbon disulfide release rate from evaporation was estimated at 14.2 lbs./min.\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint was also estimated using the USEPA guidance document.  The toxic endpoint for carbon disulfide is 50 ppm.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.  The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 51?F, and 50% average humidity.\nFinally, no carbon disulfide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, i"
