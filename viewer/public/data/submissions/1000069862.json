Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Nor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Reedsburg Fire Department which provide our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at Nor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia that is expected to be present in this system is 21,522 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, and the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Nor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation for the ammonia refrigeration system. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia refrig"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist Study. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees involved in the process receive basic training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
