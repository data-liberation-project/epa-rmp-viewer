The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary, and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are required.  A description of the Emergency Response Program is included in the Risk Management Program.\n\n3.7-PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA are listed in Appendix I.  All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.  Operating, maintenance, training and safety procedures and certification of operators shall be a priority."

Site and building plans are on file and show the locations of both portable and fixed equipment.\n\n3.3-RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThere are various measures in place or recommended as risk reduction in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to limit the endpoint distances of a release.  Ammonia detectors monitor the Main Cooler mechanical room for early detection.  One PHA recommendation is to tie relief valves into new diffuser tanks rather than piped to ambient.  There is an emergency control box for both the Main Cooler and Building C that allow manual pressure relief.  Another recommendation would also tie these into diffuser tanks.  Preventive maintenance and safety inspections are used to insure equipment and piping is maintained and operating in a safe manner.\n\n3.4-GENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nT&A maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  Releases are documented and analyzed for ways to prevent a similar future release.  A Risk Management Program which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system is maintained onsite along with this RMP. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room of the Main Cooler for shutting down the system.  An alarm and detection system will monitor the facility for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day.

Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at all T&A facilities and the same management and maintenance personnel are responsible for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents, and for responding to an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions.  The fixed system supports the main cold storage facility has an ammonia detection system tied into an alarm system that is monitored 24 hours per day.  The portable systems have no detection since the units are outdoors.  Operators are present to monitor these units when they are running.  There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Stand Operating Procedures) and the maintenance program.\n\n3.2-STATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE DESCRIPTION\n\nAt the Spreckels facility, ammonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage, produce precooling and ice generation.  A fixed system is attached to the cold storage building and is used for cold storage, pressure cooling and hydrocooling.  The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer mounted and is used for vacuum cooling and ice generation.  The fixed refrigeration system was started in April, 1988 with major additions completed in 1995 and 1996.  An existing dry storage room was converted into a refrigerated room for product consolidation in 1995 and expanded in 2000.  The cold storage rooms are designed as per current applicable building and safety codes.  Portable unit"
