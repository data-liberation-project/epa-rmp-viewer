Box 96, Elsie, Nebraska  69134-0096\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\r\n\r\nFacility Policy:\r\nThe management and employees operating our facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material stored at our location. In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nFacility Information:\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 115111, \"Support Activities for Crop Production\". We provide agricultural inputs for crop production that include receiving, storing, and blending anhydrous ammonia into liquid fertilizer for delivery to farmers in our area. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and blended for direct application to farm fields during spring and fall of the year. During the balance of the year little, if any product transfer occurs. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a railcar.\r\n\r\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and blending of product for delivery. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore item number 1.11 is Zero. Our facility has adequate lighting, is fenced, and is inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenario:\r\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank. The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards, the dist"

We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on anhydrous ammonia.
