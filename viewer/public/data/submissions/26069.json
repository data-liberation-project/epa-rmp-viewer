Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Old Monroe Elevator and Supply Company (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and sale of fertilizers and other agri-chemicals to local area farmers. This includes anhydrous ammonia. It is stored in one (1) - 18,000 (78,800 pounds) gallon steel, pressurized tank. \n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios:  A) The  Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank at the site. Ther maximum quantity released would be about 78,800 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. the distance to the Endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 2.1 miles. B) The Alternative Release Case Scenario, based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a 3\" transfer hose. The distance to the Endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as promulgated by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property da"

      "SummaryText": "mage at the facility, nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anhydrous ammopina for implementation at this time."
