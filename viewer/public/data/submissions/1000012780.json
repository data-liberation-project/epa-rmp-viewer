      "SummaryText": "Solo Cup Company, Inc., located at 1100 N. Glenstone Ave. in Springfield, Missouri manufactures disposable food containers, including those consisting of polystyrene foam.  This foam production process uses Difluorethane (CAS # 75-37-6).  Solo Cup  is  dedicated to the safety of our employees and  our community.  Our corporate safety policy reinforces Solo's commitment to providing a safe environment for employees and our neighboring community.  The Plant occupies 1,350,000 square feet of space on a 79 acre lot.  The worst case scenario depicts the release of 44,000 pounds of Difluorethane.  RMP Comp software was used to model this release.  There is a potential for offsite impact.  The alternative scenario depicts a 15 minute release of Difluorethane with excess flow detection control devices mitigating further release.  The emergency response program includes coordination with local emergency response groups.  The emergency response plan includes notification procedures, emergency contacts, etc.  Employees receive annual emergency response training.  Safety training at our plant is an ongoing process.  Safety program and procedures our evaluated as necessary as part of the plant's day to day operations require."
