Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by SPF personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nSPF will provide employment for approximately 120 workers in Moberly, Missouri. This facility is a ready to eat slide bacon and bacon bits retail manufacturing plant with a parent company of JBS USA, LLC, which has headquarters at 1770 Promontory Cir., Greely, CO 80631. The facility is operated by Swift Prepared Foods, which has headquarters at 651 W. Washington Blvd., Suite 302 , Chicago , Illinois 60661.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. SPF will receive slabs of uncooked pork bellies and slice them into strips that are cooked in a microwave and packaged for retail sale. The facility will also receive bits and pieces of uncooked bacon from on-site and other sites that will be diced, cooked in another microwave, and packaged for retail sale.  Before and after the cooking process the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n(c)    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: SPF"

The last PHA was conducted on March 24 and 25, 2021, using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Ammonia refrigeration process. This process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: SPF will update and re-validated the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA was conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system has been established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed ; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: SPF has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.

These operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in process chemicals, technology,  and equipment, and changes to the facility. SPF will annually certify that these operating procedures are current and accurate. SPF has developed and implemented safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the SPF facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining: SPF provides training for each employee associated with the Ammonia refrigeration process. This training includes an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined by 40 CFR 68.71. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary. SPF documents and maintains records of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: SPF has written documents and programs to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the Ammonia refrigeration process (i.e., storage tanks, piping systems, etc); additionally , inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed.  Each person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the ammonia process components receives training at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: SPF has established and will implement written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and, changes to SPF that affect the Ammonia refrigeration process.
