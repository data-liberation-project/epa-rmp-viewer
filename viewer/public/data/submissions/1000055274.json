      "SummaryText": "The City of Duncan, Oklahoma operates a water treatment plant located within the city limits in the eastern portion of the city. The plant uses chlorine to treat the city's water for the city. The reatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The maximun inventory is 9 tons and the treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to two. The worst case scenario for Duncan Water Plant is a 1 ton cylinder result in an estimated Level of Concern [LOC] of 1.2 miles using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. The first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] from the cylinder to the header pipe. This has an estimated LOC of 0.99 miles and a release of approximately 1100 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. The Duncan Water Plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance programs to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility. Because of the strict implementation of te above mentioned programs, this facility has not had a significant release within the last five years. The Duncan Water Plant holds training and refresher coursesfor the personnel at the facility regarding the chlorine system and its concerns and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). However, if an accidnet occurred, the Local Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC] and the Duncan Fire Department would be notified and would respond immediately. The Duncan Water Plant has no current plans to change the chlorine process in the foreseeable future."
