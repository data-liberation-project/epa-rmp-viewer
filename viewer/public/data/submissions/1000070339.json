      "SummaryText": "This is OFS Fitel's first submission of the Risk Management Plan to the Environmental Protection Agency. The reason for this is because recently, we are in close range of the threshold quantity of chlorine used in the Storage Area process. No other single process by EPA definition at OFS reaches the threshold quantity needed to report an RMP \n\n\n\nProcess #1: Storage Area:\n\nThe storage area is located at the far northwest corner of the larger facility; it is far away from all other processes onsite. The larger facility has other processes running 24 hours a day. The larger facility is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence and requires RFID access to get in. The larger facility is monitored 24/7 by security and cameras, with sweeps of the perimeter often done throughout the day and night. The storage area is blocked off with a moving chain-linked gate and requires RFID access only given to a select few employees. The rest of the storage area is surrounded by opaque walls and a roof on top. The storage area is monitored by security personnel and cameras that surround the area.\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored in the storage area in gas cylinders that contain 110 pounds of pure 100% chlorine. These cylinders pressurize the gas and make it a liquid. All cylinders are properly chained to the storage racks. Using the RMP-Comp&trade;, the worst-case scenario was calculated. A value for the amount released was found by taking the historically highest amount of inventory inside the storage area and any one time. An inventory check is done at the end of every month to quantify how much chlorine is stored in the storage area. Using this value for the worst-case scenario, a release radius of 1.5 miles was calculated. The following is a list of major infrastructure affected by a potential worst-case scenario: I-85 Exit 99, Jimmy Carter Boulevard, Best Friend Park, Graves Park, Graves Elementary School, and Gwinnett County Public Library.\n\n\n\nWhile this scenario is theoretically possible, its like"

      "SummaryText": "lihood of occurring is astronomically low. A more reasonable scenario would be the compromising of one of the chlorine cylinders. The alternative-case scenario is estimated that a 10 lbs/min leak will occur over the course of 60 min. This resulted in a negligible dispersion model for the chlorine.This site has no flammables that exceed the threshold quantities, and this site has no incidences relating to chlorine accidents in the storage area process.\n\n\n\nMany steps were taken to comply with Prevention Program standards for Program 3. An internal HAZOP and What-If analysis was done on the process storage area, which has been reviewed by a third-party auditor. OFS also has an extensive Emergency Preparedness Plan and Natural Disaster Contingency Plan to handle major hazards associated with the storage area process and other processes at the larger facility. Trainings are done with employees who have access to the storage area process. These trainings are done every three years and require trainees to pass a multiple choice test to make sure they understood the training. Because of the nature of the storage area process; maintenance, management of change, pre-startup reviews, and hot work permits do not apply to this process. Compliance audits are done often both by internal and external agencies. A systematic incident investigation procedural instruction is used in order to investigate incidences at the storage area process and other processes at the larger facility. Employee participation plans include annual safety cookouts and occasional safety lunch-and-learns where we include letting employees know about our risk management plan. A procedural instruction on contractor safety is applied to the storage area process and other process in the larger facility.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive emergency response procedural instruction has been issued for the larger facility (PI-0268). This instructions goes through (1) procedures for reporting fires and other emergencies, (2) emergen"
