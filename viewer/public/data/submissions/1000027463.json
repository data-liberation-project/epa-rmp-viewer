Peacock Engineering is a contract food packaging and co-manufacturing facility that provides manufacturing / processing support, secondary packaging and shipping to suppliers and distribution centers. \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 31199.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for packaging and distribution.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating coolers and freezers throughout the facility. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently onsite has been estimated at approximately 23,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool freezers, coolers, production rooms, and docks.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The ammonia related equipment could be divided into two sections. The \"low stage\" equipment contains (1) -10 Freezer Evaporator, (1) Bologna Freezer Evaporator, (1) Cheese Freezer Evaporator, Low Temperature Pump Package (PR-2), (1) Oil Pot and (1) Booster Compressor.  \r\n\r\nThe \"high stage\" equipment contains (6) Production Room Evaporators, (3) Ultima B Room Evaporators, (3) Ultima A Room Evaporators, (3) Cooler 1 Evaporators, (2) Dock 1 Evaporators, (4) Oswald Room Evaporators, (2) Yellow Room Evaporators, (5) Secondary Packaging Room Evaporators, (2) Viking Room Evaporators, (3) Cooler 2 Evaporators, (2) Dock 2 Evaporators, (8) Cooler 3 Evaporators, (2) Dock 3 Evaporators, (1) Bread Room Evaporator, (2) KWT-3 Room Evaporators, (2) CP-13 Room Evaporators,"

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \r\n\r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program has been developed to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur by November 11, 2013, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.
