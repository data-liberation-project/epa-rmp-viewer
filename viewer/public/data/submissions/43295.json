With regards to 40 CFR Part 68, chlorine is the only listed chemical handled and stored at quantities exceeding the threshold quantities.  Chlorine was first brought onto the site in April 2000, with the startup of a Powell Continuous Bleach Plant.  The facility includes no permanent storage for chlorine. Chlorine will be supplied to the process directly from rail cars.  The facility has been designed to accommodate a maximum of two 90 ton rail cars.  Only one car will be in service at any time.  Chlorine is transferred to the production unit fronm the rail car in liquid form.,  There are no intermediate storage vessels or vaporizer systems for chlorine.  The chlorine is 100% consumed in the production of sodium hypochlorite bleach solution. Chlorine is not used in any other process nor is it repackaged and shipped from the facility.  The chlorine is transferred to the process via a permanent pipeline using dry compressed air. The pipeline  construction is welded steel with a minimum of flanged joints. All welds have been x-ray tested to assure the quality of welded joints. The maximum pressure in the chlorine system during unloading is 130 psig. The pressure rating for the rail car is 375 psig.  The piping system has a pressure relief system utilizing rupture disks which relieve into expansion tanks. Every section of pipe that can be isolated between two valves is fitted with a rupture disk/expansion tank system. The tanks have both local pressure indication, as well as pressure switches which will be tied in to the plant-wide control and monitoring system. The unloading system incorporates the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System. Chlorine detectors are located in the vicinity of the rail car and a railcar movement detection system is attached to the car. All devices are connected to a plant wide monitoring and control system which will issue warnings and/or alarms as appropriat"

      "SummaryText": "e. For any failure or alarm condition, the Powell Unloading Valve Closure System will activate closing the railcar valves. The unloading system has been designed to allow for the depressurization and complete purging of the chlorine from the chlorine pipeline via the powell Provent Scrubber System.In the event of a power interruption, a battery backup system will allow for two to five hours of run time for the plant-wide monitoring and control system and appropriate devices. In the production of bleach, a controlled flow of chlorine is injected into a recirculating flow of dilute caustic soda/bleach solution. The chlorine is 100% consumed in the reaction to form the sodium hypochlorite bleach solution. No regulated waste chlorine or chlorine byproduct is generated by any handling or processing at the Indianapolis facility.  All aspects of chlorine handling and use at the facility are covered by the facility's Process Safety Management Plan. The operating procedures are reviewed and updated whenever an operation change is made.  If no operational changes are made, the operating procedures are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. The ISO 9001:2000 program at GAC MidAmerica, Inc. requires rigid compliance to operating procedures, preventive maintenance, and instrument calibrations. The ISO program is audited internally twice a year (distributed throughout the year) and recertified by a Third Party Auditor annually.  Mandatory monthly safety training sessions are attended by all production and maintenance employees. The subjects include annual training of operating procedures, hazards communications, fire safety, electrical safety, and pollution prevention.  GAC MidAmerica, Inc. coordinates with the Marion County LEPC to address incidents that may occur at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan for the facility was first published in March 2000.  The plan covers all the processes and chemicals handled at the facility. The plan is coordinated with the Marion C"
