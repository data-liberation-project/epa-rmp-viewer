The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management and emplyees of Faulkner Ag Center Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to minigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers and the use of propane to dry corn.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the farmer's field.\n\n     The maximum quanity of anhydrous stored and handled would be 51,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n     The maximum amount of propane stored and handled would be 22,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     a.     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas ove 10 minutes.  The maximum wuantity released would be 60,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.4 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standars Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)"
