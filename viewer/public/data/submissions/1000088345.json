(OHLP) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  OHLP management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Conway LPG Storage Facility is one of many facilities owned and operated by OHLP.  The facility receives various products via pipeline, rail and truck and stores them in above ground vessels and underground storage caverns.  These products are shipped to customers via pipeline, truck and rail.  The RMP flammable substances stored at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity are:  propane, butane, isobutene, butylene, two propylene mixtures, natural gasoline, and ethyl mercaptan.  There are no toxic chemicals present at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by OHLP.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n-  Operating in compliance with required env"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-  Monitoring and detection system to detect a hydrocarbon release.  \n\n-  The facility is manned 24 hours per day providing routine surveillance.\n\n-  Audible and visual warning alarms located throughout the facility warn of possible emergency situations.\n\n-  Testing of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n-  Providing emergency shutdown buttons at various locations within the facility.\n\n\n\n    \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    \n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or significant property damage or known offsite impacts, such as death, injury, property damage, shelter in place, evacuation, or environmental damage from a flammable substance release has occurred at the facility within the last five years. \n\n    \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n    \n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Conway LPG Storag"
