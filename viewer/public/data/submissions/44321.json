EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Escanaba Paper Company (EPC) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, EPC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Two components of this system are a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that helps manage the risk and that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; and a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at EPC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.    \n\nThe process safety and risk management program at EPC consists of three elements:\n\nA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\nA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\nAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at EPC helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is"

      "SummaryText": " only one component of the safety program at EPC.  In fact, EPC has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguard against release of a hazardous substance and resultant injuries or damage from such a release.\n\nEPC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Prior to using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at EPC, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, as well as the environment and steps are taken to prevent any such effects.\n\nEPC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at EPC, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nEPC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  EPC trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release should one occur.  In addition, EPC works with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur. \n\nThe safety program at EPC consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at EPC that are required by the RMP rule. \n                                                                                                                                                                         1.1     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEPC is committed to the safety and health of our employees, contractors, the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

EPC provides response training to EPC personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local public safety department.

The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) although unlikely, is more probable than a worst-case release scenario and (2) could result in a potential off-site consequence.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule requires specific requirements for the worst case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by EPC.  These requirements are:\n\nOne worst case scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 2 or Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing both chlorine and chlorine dioxide)\nOne alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substance in a Program 2 or Program 3 process (i.e., chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ammonia)\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analyses performed by EPC.\n\n1.3.1     Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\nInformation related to Off-site Consequence Analysis has been removed per the new requirements.\n\n1.4     Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nEPC maintains a prevention program to help "

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  Industry standards are followed at EPC to help ensure safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia vendor supplies ammonia via Department of Transportation (DOT) -approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for ammonia developed by EPC.  \n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 1-ton containers.  Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  If release occurs downstream of the regulator at the container, the regulator will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in all areas containing chlorine.  Employees who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for chlorine developed by EPC.\n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine Dioxide is produced at the EPC facility and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a chlorine dioxide solution (1.0%wt) is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A diked area around the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.  \n\n1.5  Five-Year Accide"
