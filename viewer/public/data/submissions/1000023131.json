The site is an OSHA VPP Star Site and is certified for ISO 9001 Quality Management System.\n\na) Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nThe Edison site as of June 2006 has two occupants, Equistar Chemicals, LP, and Grace Davison. Equistar is the site owner and operates one large process; Grace owns three of the site buildings and operates other processes. Equistar provides and manages a broad spectrum of services to Grace including Utilities, Maintenance, shipping/receiving/warehousing and Emergency Response (ER) for both companies. To the extent possible, all Emergency Response programs apply to all site operations and both Equistar and Grace are co-owners of these programs.\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at the Edison site is documented in the \"Management System\" document. It includes all the required elements of RMP including maintaining Process Safety Information, Employee Participation, Process Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment, Standard Operating Procedures, Operator Training, Pre-startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Accident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, Contractors and Inherently Safe Technology review.\n\nThe Edison site strives to maintain a safe working environment, it is therefore essential that employees be able to deal effectively with emergencies that may develop during course of operations. Therefore, a multi-functional ER team (ERT) has been formed. The site ERT shall provide the actions necessary to control an emergency with the following priorities:\n1.    To safeguard the lives of company personnel;\n2.    To protect the well being of our visitors, contractors, truck drivers, neighbors and the community;\n3.    To protect the environment;\n4.    To protect company property.\n\nThe areas of res"

Community relations\n\nIt is the Edison site policy to cooperate fully with local, State and Federal agencies to mitigate any emergency. Therefore, emergency response organizations shall be provided with the current issue of the Emergency Response Plan, and are invited to participate in annual emergency response exercises. Material Safety data Sheets for all hazardous materials stored at site are available to both site personnel and Edison township emergency responders through site Hazard Communication Program.\n\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Grace facility is covered by EPA-RMP and NJ-TCPA regulations due to the presence of Titanium Tetrachloride and Isopentane in above threshold quantities at the facility.\n\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nSite release prevention and chemical specific prevention includes process safety equipment, mitigation systems, and leak detection equipment including preventative maintenance program covering such equipment, an operator training program, and a Management of Change procedure. All such equipment is owned, operated and maintained by Equistar as per contract; all such procedures and programs, however, are co-owned by both Equistar and Grace.\n\nProcess safety equipment used for both the regulated chemicals includes relief devices such as relief valves and rupture discs, vents, check valves, quench systems, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, grounding and purge systems.\n\nMitigation systems in the accidental release prevention program includes, dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, hazmat foam system, fire fighting foam systems, mineral oil dump system, neutralization and fire water containment system.\n\nLeak d"

      "SummaryText": "etection systems are installed in process areas to detect toxic or flammable leaks.\n\nThe preventive maintenance program includes inspections and tests to assure the proper operation of preventive devices. Management of change procedure assures that all changes are reviewed for their hazards and preventive steps are implemented prior to implementation of the changes. All incidents and near misses are investigated to determine the root cause and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents.\n\nd) The five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases from the covered processes which meet the requirements of section 68.42 on 40 CFR 68 subpart A.\ne) The emergency response program:\n\nThe site emergency response program meets the requirements of the EPA Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance. The plan defines the response organization, coordination with the local emergency response committee, equipment, response procedures, training, notification procedures and drills. The plan is updated according to the recommendations from the system deficiencies uncovered by periodic drills and incidents reports. As stated above, all Emergency Response programs apply to all site operations and both Equistar and Grace are co-owners of these programs.\n\nf) Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nRecently installed a second tank to be used to collect a Titanium Tetrachloride spill to reduce impact of a spill on the plant and surrounding community.\n\nTraining on Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information is being conducted per the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n"
