We use a combination of good design practices, an accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA\u00bfs RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide information about two types of off site consequence analysis scenarios:  worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  There are specific requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative.  The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards.  The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still extremely low probability events.\n\nFollowing are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit exposure distances.\n\nWorst-case Toxic Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the toxic substances handled by Vulcan is a catastrophic rupture of a storage tank containing chlorine.  The entire quantity of chlorine is released to the atmosphere over a 10-min period from one of our chlorine vessels.  Although we have several mitigation features on these storage tanks that would limit the release rate and/or quantity of the release, none of these measures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  \n\nWorst-case Flammable Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the flammable substances handled by Vulcan is a catastrophic rupture of a storage tank containing vinyl chloride.  The entire quantity of vinyl chloride is released to the atmosphere, where it ignites and expl"

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprised of personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new or improved process.

Our personnel regularly monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.  Infractions of safety procedures are grounds for craftsman or contractor expulsion.\n\n \nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but often is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with PSM, CMA Responsible CARE Codes and  the RMP rule.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the Vulcan-Geismar plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.

As a part of this manufacturing process, we use several substances that are covered by the risk management program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  These include chlorine, chloroform, methyl chloride, propylene oxide and vinyl chloride.  Vulcan's products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout America and the world, playing a role in nearly every modern industry and in thousands of products that consumers use every day.  Common uses of chlorine include treatment of municipal water supplies, sewage wastewaters, and the manufacturing of bleach and pharmaceuticals. Our customers use chloroform to manufacture refrigerant R-22, pharmaceuticals, plastics, dyes, resins, and fire extinguishing agents.  Chloroform is also used as an extraction solvent in the recovery of penicillin, vitamins and essential oils.  End uses of methyl chloride include manufacture of silicone products, synthetic rubber products and agricultural chemicals.  Vinyl chloride is used as a raw material in the production of specialized hydrocarbons for use as refrigerants or degreasing agents.  \nBesides process equipment, the plant has a number of tanks used for the storage of raw materials and products, rail car and"

Although we have several features that help to prevent this scenario, or that mitigate the consequences of such a release, no credit is taken for these measures.  \n\nAlternative Toxic Release Scenarios\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a break in the pipe used for unloading chlorine from a rail car into our process.  The flow rate to the atmosphere is limited because a greater flow rate will activate the excess flow valve and shut off the flow.  The release lasts for 15 min, which is a conservative estimate of the time required for a Vulcan employee to stop the release. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform is a rupture of the expansion chamber at the bottom of the chloroform storage tank. This toxic liquid spills out onto the ground  for 10 minutes, which is a reasonable maximum estimate of the time required for a Vulcan employee to stop the release.  The chloroform evaporates from the liquid pool. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is a break in the pipe used for loading methyl chloride from the process into a tank truck.  The chemical is pumped to the atmosphere for the 15 min we conservatively assume is required for a Vulcan employee to stop the flow. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for propylene oxide is a failure in the loading hose used to fill the propylene oxide storage tank.  The chemical spills out  until it can be isolated in 10 minutes.  The chemical vaporizes upon release. \n\n\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a rupture of a rail car containing vinyl chloride.  The entire quantity of vinyl chloride is assumed to be involved in an explosion of the subsequent vapor cloud.   \n\nThis scenario is chosen because it results in an off site end point distance , as required by EPA's risk management program rule.

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and (4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Vulcan-Geismar plant performs some form of a pre-startup safety review, which is dictated by the complexity of the modification.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.
