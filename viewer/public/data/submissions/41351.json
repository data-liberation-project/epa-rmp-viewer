The information contained in this executive summary will be submitted with Downer Grove Sanitary District?s (DGSD) Risk Management Plan.  \nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\n      DGSD?s goal in implementing the Risk Management Program is to reduce employee and public risk of injury or death from an accidental release of chemicals.  DGSD is committed to achieving this goal.\nFacility and Chemicals Description\n      DGSD is charged with the responsibility for wastewater collection and treatment services within its jurisdiction.  The District?s boundaries currently encompass approximately 20 square miles of DuPage County.  The District primarily serves the Villages of Downers Grove, Westmont, Oak Brook, Darien, and Woodridge, Illinois.  Adjacent, unincorporated areas in DuPage County are also served by the District.\n      DGSD currently operates one Wastewater Treatment Center (WWTC) treating an average of 11 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater and maintaining 232 miles of interceptor collection lines.  The District also provides other programs related to water resources such as industrial pretreatment programs.\n      The WWTC uses chlorine primarily for disinfection, sand filter cleaning, and activated sludge filamentous control.  Sulfur dioxide is used at the WWTC for dechlorination.\n      The DGSD RMP applies to processes involving the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  At DGSD, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used at the wastewater treatment plant.  The covered processes at DGSD meet the RMP Program 3 eligibility requirements.\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n      RMP*Comp software was used to determine the worst-case and alternative release scenarios at DGSD.  An EPA document, Risk Management Program Guidance for "

In response to the requirements in the Final Rule, April 9, 2004, a description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) is not included in this executive summary.\nGeneral Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n      In addition to the EPA?s RMP rule, DGSD also complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Program.  \n      At DGSD, several practices are important to the prevention program.  These practices are:\n* Inspection of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers upon receipt.\n* Rigorous inspections twice a day of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinder rooms.\n\n* Daily tests of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detector alarms.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n      DGSD has an excellent chemical handling history.  In the five years prior to June 1, 2004, no accidental releases from covered processes have occurred.  No deaths, injuries, or significant property damage have occurred either on or off-site.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n      DGSD wastewater treatment facility will rely on community emergency responders in the case of an accidental release of chlorine.  Employees are also trained to stop small chemical leaks on-site.  This training reduces the hazardous effects of minor releases and the potential for minor releases to have off-site effects.  \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n      An emergency action training program has been developed and implemented at DGSD.  The training program for emergency action provides employees with guidance on what to do in case of a medical, fire, and/or chemical discharge emergency.  This plan has been created with the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  \n      This training allows DGSD to quickly and safely handle all releases at the WWTC.\n\nMay 2004"
