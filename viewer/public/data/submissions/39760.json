All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention program are adhered to. The LWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB. The LWP chlorination system has been installed to disinfect the flow in the Lewisburg Water System. The water serves customers in the city of Lewisburg and some county residents. The Plant is located at 830 Old Farmington Road. The plant includes a chlorination room which contains ton cylinders of liquid chlorine under pressure, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels and instrument room. The amount of chlorine handled is six (6) one ton cylinders. The facility is manned 16 hours per day by on-site personnel and computer telemetry monitoring 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n\nC. The LWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n      -High element of training of operators.\n      -Preventative maintenance programs\n      -Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n      -Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of operators\n      -Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n      -Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n      \nChemical specific prevention steps include awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, availability of self-contained breathing apparatus(SCBA),and proper training of onsite personnel.  \n\nD. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past 10 years.\n\nE. The facility has "
