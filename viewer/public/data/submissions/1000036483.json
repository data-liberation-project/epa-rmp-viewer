Methyl Chloride is used to produce methyl based quaternary ammonium compounds at the facility.  This is the only storage tank for Methyl Chloride and the release is contained within a concrete dike.

The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) is 3.2 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire contents of 231,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  DMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Dimethylamine and the release is contained within a concrete dike.

Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Evonik employees, Chemtura employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Air Liquided employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.082mg/l) is 0.20 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp model, and the estimated duration of the release to the atmosphere is 20 minutes.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate case secnario selected is a 0.5 inch diameter rupture in a 2 inch storage tank transfer line that releases 5,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Evonik employees, Chemtura Corporation employees, Caterpillar Inc. employees, Air Liquide employees, and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.
