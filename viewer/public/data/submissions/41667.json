EMH&T has revised the pages of the original PSM and RMP prepared by Woolpert LLP in 1999. Since 1999, no improvements to the chlorine processes have occurred. As a result none of the procedures have been modified; however, portions of the Plan have been modified as requested by Ohio EPA.\nBACKGROUND\nThe State of Ohio has adopted many OSHA standards, including PSM. To clarify this issue in the RMP regulation, the Ohio EPA has reference to both regulations (the adoption of the OSHA regulations and the federal OSHA PSM regulation). On February 24, 1992, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued 29 CFR 1910.119 in the Federal Register, \"The Process Safety Management Standard\" (Standard). The purpose of the Standard is to \"establish procedures for process safety management that will protect employees by preventing or minimizing the consequences of chemical accidents involving highly hazardous chemicals.\" The requirements of the standard are intended to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of unwanted releases of chemicals, especially into locations which could expose employees and others to serious hazards.\nThe standard applies to any facility employing a process which involves the use of a chemical at or above the specified threshold quantities listed in Appendix A of the standard. Facilities impacted by the standard must develop a Process Safety Management Program to be in compliance. An essential element of the Process Safety Management Program is the preparation of a Process Safety Management Plan. The Plan consists of detailed procedures, safety information, hazard analyses, and training programs for each process which involves the use of any of the specified chemicals in quantities above the threshold limit.\nThe City of Zanesville Wastewater Treatment Plant has a "

This standard applies to any facility process that involves the use of a chemical at or above the threshold quantities listed in Appendix A under the Federal Register. Facilities that fall under this standard must prepare a Risk Management Program and Plan to be in compliance with this regulation. Risk Management Program requirements are presented at three program levels, based upon the eligibility criteria for each program.\nBased upon criteria of the standard, the City of Zanesville's risk management program and plan to follow was developed to meet the applicable requirements of program Level 3."
