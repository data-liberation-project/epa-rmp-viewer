This heavy oil must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels.  In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce less smog upon combustion by cars and trucks.  Alaskan North Slope Crude, while not as heavy as San Joaquin Valley Crude, also must undergo similar processing to produce motor fuels.  An overall block flow diagram of the refinery is included in Attachment B.\r\n\r\nCrude Oil begins its journey through the refinery at the Crude Units.  Desalters dehydrate the oil and remove salts electrically to reduce the oil\u00bfs corrosivity.  It is then sent to the distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight.  Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons.  The distillation tower produces six fractions:  wet gas/butanes, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil and resid.  The heaviest component, resid, is sent to the Feed Prep units for further distillation under vacuum.  After vacuum distillation,  the Feed Prep bottom product, which is made up of very heavy hydrocarbons and is solid at ambient temperature,  is sent to the Coker.  The Coker thermally cracks large molecules  into smaller ones.  These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels.  The Coker also produces petroleum coke, which is a fine black carbon powder.\r\n\r\nThe gas oil fractions from the Crude Units, the Feed Prep Units, and the Coker are still too heavy for use as motor fuels.  These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and/or the Hydrocracker Unit.  Both of these units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of a catalyst.  Catalytic cracking is more selective than thermal cracking.

The cracking process in the Hydrocracer occurs in the presence of Hydrogen gas.  Olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during the hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds.  \r\n\r\nThe Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) units remove sulfur and nitrogen from their feedstocks, creating Hydrogen Sulfide and Ammonia, which are separated and processed elsewhere.  These units also saturate olefins.  The HDS units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning gasoline, since the removal of these compounds is critical to preventing smog from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel.  The Hydrodearomatization (HDA) unit removes aromatic compounds from diesel fractions, a necessary step in the production  of producing cleaner burning fuels.  The Butadiene plant saturates the Butadiene generated from the Coker.  Butadiene is an olefin and is undesirable in gasoline.  The Reformer Units rearrange hydrocarbons from straight chains into branched chains, rings and aromatics; these compounds are desirable because they raise the octane number of the motor fuels.  Aromatic compounds created by the Reforming units are saturated in the Benzene Saturation Unit, ensuring their removal from clean fuel production.

These materials range in flammability from Pentane (with a flash point greater than -40? F) to Hydrogen (with a flash point of -100? F).  For reference, a flash point is defined as the lowest temperature at which a liquid will give off sufficient vapor to ignite on application of a flame.  Larger flash points indicate less flammability.  Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions involving these compounds.  For comparison, gasoline has a flash point of -45? F and diesel fuel has a flash point of 125? F.  Propane and Butane are flammable gasses with flash points lower than gasoline. \r\n\r\nAs part of refining crude oil to motor fuels, other regulated substances are generated in addition to the flammables.

These safeguards were either originally constructed in the unit or implemented as a recommendation from a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Compliance Audit, and/or Incident Investigation.  Safeguards are examined during a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) by the PHA team for their adequacy in detecting, preventing and/or mitigating any potential hazards of the process.  If a PHA team determines that the safeguards do not adequately protect against a particular hazard, they recommend additional safeguards to the process.\r\n\r\nAs part of the PHA study, potential hazards and their safeguards are examined in a rigorous, methodical fashion for a variety of scenarios.  The primary focus is on prevention of the occurrence of a scenario.  The following gives examples of safeguards designed for prevention of a potential hazard.  Safeguards protecting against excessive pressure include high pressure alarms, pressure safety valves, thermal relief valves, piping/flange/equipment pressure ratings, water separation facilitie"

Safeguards against low flow or no flow include low flow alarms, recycle streams, shutdown systems and check valves.  High and low levels are protected against by high and low level alarms and shutdown systems.  Safeguards against contamination include use of analyzers, check valves and standardized utility connections.  Prevention safeguards against explosions include furnace instrumentation.  Loss of containment is protected against by isolation valves, proper material selection for corrosion and temperature, avoidance of dead legs, periodic inspection, proper water draw and sampling facility design, locked valves, proper design of pipe bracing and vent locations, freeze protection, proper pipe rating, emergency block valves and excess flow valves.  Safeguards for instrument failure include periodic testing of critical safety devices, including pressure safety valves.  Many of the safeguards mentioned above are automatic safety systems that are commonly referred to as interlocks.  In addition, process areas vent to the refinery flare safety system, which safely burns the flammable material.  \r\n\r\nWhile the emphasis is on prevention of potential hazards, sometimes these events occur.

The program should include development of written procedures, training of maintenance personnel, inspection and testing of equipment, process for equipment repair and a method for assuring quality of process repair and construction.\r\n\r\nThe refinery\u00bfs Mechanical Integrity Program addresses the integrity of process equipment and instrumentation for safe and reliable operations.  The refinery maintenance program covers three types of maintenance:  1) preventative and predictive maintenance, 2) routine maintenance (repair), and 3) turnarounds.  Preventative maintenance is performance of equipment inspection and repair based on time and historical knowledge of the equipment.  Predictive maintenance involves utilizing technological methods of inspection to determine equipment condition.  Preventative and predictive maintenance used in combination determine the inspection and repair frequency of equipment at the refinery.  Routine maintenance is the repair or corrective maintenance of equipment as dictated by predictive maintenance, preventative maintenance and equipment condition.  A turnaround is maintenance of a process unit on a large scale.  A turnaround is the periodic shutdown of a processing unit for cleaning, internal inspection and renewal.  The process unit is opened up and its critical components are inspected and repaired during a turnaround.

Root Cause Analysis is an in-depth investigation method that determines the underlying causes of an incident.  The refinery utilizes the cause mapping method by Think Reliability to perform Root Cause Analysis.  This method is based upon a method developed by the Department of Energy.  The investigation involves gathering data by performing site inspections, conducting interviews of involved personnel and emergency responders and reviewing relevant documentation, such as regulations, standards, engineering data and refinery procedures.  This data is then analyzed by placing the information into a logic flow type diagram to determine the root causes.  The final report from a Root Cause Analysis includes the same incident investigation form as described above as well as a more comprehensive report about the findings from the incident.  The report will describe:  the location of the incident and equipment involved, date and time of incident, date and time investigation began, description of events leading to incident, description of conditions existing at the site prior to incident, description of how and why incident occurred based on findings, description of emergency response, causal factors and root causes identified, description of the nature and severity of losses suffered and a statement about specificity of incident to this or other processes.\r\n\r\nSerious and major level incident investigations are conducted by teams.

Hot work is defined as any work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations.\r\n\r\nThe refinery has a written permitting program to address Hot Work.  The purpose of the Hot Work program is to develop and implement consistent hot work practices and precautions to control tasks that may create sources of ignition.  The program also provides consistent planning and authorization of those tasks.  The Hot Work program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because it provides a consistent methodology to address prevention of fires that could potentially result from ignition producing work.  In addition, the Hot Work program satisfies the requirements of Section 2760.11 of the CalARP regulation and Title 8 California Code of Regulations Sections 4848 and 6777.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Work Permitting Program applies to all equipment or tasks capable of generating energy sufficient to ignite flammable/combustible materials, vapors or gasses.

      "SummaryText": "n operator was exposed to SO2 from Spent Sulfuric Acid.  An operator in an adjacent unit was attempting to start a spent acid pump.  The pump was vented.  The SO2 containing vapor entered the intake of the #3Reformer/#3HDS/Alky control room.  The inhalation resulted in a recordable injury that required medical treatment above first aid.  The incident lasted less than five minutes and it was estimated that less than 1.0 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide was released.  Weather conditions:  the weather conditions are unknown.  No other injuries were reported on or off site.  No agencies were notified of this incident.  Root Causes identified were as follows:  Root Cause #1 The pump start up procedure needs revision to not vent the pump to a safer location.  Root Cause #2 There is SO2 in spent acid that may readily off gas when the spent acid is transferred.  Root Cause #3 There is no means for detecting SO2 in this area.  Root Cause #4 The operators were not familiar with how to shut down the control room ventilation.  Corrective actions:  Revise the pump startup procedure (addresses root cause #1).  Include SO2 evolution concerns in the pump upgrade project (addresses root cause #2).  Provide operators with personal SO2 monitors (addresses root cause #3).  Review control room ventilation shut down with all operators (addresses root cause #4).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal, state and local regulations require the development and implementation of an emergency response plan that describes emergency preparedness and response and addresses notification of the public.  The emergency response plan is also required to address the use, inspection, testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment and the training of the facility\u00bfs emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\nThe refinery\u00bfs emergency response program is described in a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and it consists of an emergency response organization, procedures for response and equipment for response."
