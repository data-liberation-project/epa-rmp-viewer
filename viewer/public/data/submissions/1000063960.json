Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Full-Fill Industries, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental \n\nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \n\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \n\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of aerosol cans.  We have 2 \n\nregulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\n\nmethyl] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used as an aerosol propellant.  Propane \n\nis used as an  aerosol propellant.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \n\nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \n\nlimit the distances for each reported scenario to perform the required offsite consequence \n\nanalysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The \n\nconsequences of these scenarios are contained in section 4 and 5 of the RMP.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\n\n                Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \n\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \n\nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.
