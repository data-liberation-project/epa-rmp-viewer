Our facility is State inspected on a regular basis to ensure safety.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nOur worst case scenario would involve the total loss of product in the storage tank. When filled to capacity \n\nthis would amount to 80,000 pound of anhydrous ammonia.  Results of the RMP*Comp show that total \n\nrelease over a 10 minute period would have off site impacts.  Central Rivers has never had any kind of \n\nrelease at any of its storage facilities and we hope this record continues.  \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from out facility would not reach an end point off-site.  The \n\nalternative release using  RMP*Comp with a 5 minute release at 1000 lbs. per minute would have some off-\n\nsite impact.  Again Central Rivers has never had a release at any storage facility. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have never been any accidents at any of our sites causing death, injury or property damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is Central Rivers policy to notify the local \n\nfire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have \n\ncoordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and tours if needed to ensure \n\nthat they are familiar with our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has a strategy for \n\nresponding to the threat posed by and ammonia release."

We store and distribute a wide variety of Ag \n\nsupplies, anhydrous ammonia being one of these products.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and \n\nstored on site.  We refill 1000 and 1500 gallon tanks for area growers they use this as a source of nitrogen \n\nfor their crops\n\n\nThis location has an 18000 gallon storage tank which when filled to capacity will hold approximately \n\n80,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  We also have 17 - 1000 gallon nurse tanks and 1 - 1500 gallon \n\nnurse tank.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nCentral Rivers Coop has developed a Safety Committee involving employees from all locations.  This is to \n\nensure employee involvement on all levels.  Central Rivers goal is to have an accident free work \n\nenvironment and we hold monthly safety training sessions to instill this in our employees.  Before any \n\nemployee works with anhydrous ammonia or any other sensitive material they are required to complete \n\nsafety and handling training.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and \n\ncertification and hands on training.  Location managers are directly involved to make sure training is \n\ncomplete.  \n\n\nAll locations are required to have safety equipment checks at each fill.  Checks include valves, hoses, \n\nbleeder valves, gauges, water supply, gloves and goggles, tires, wheel bearings, relief valves and general \n\ncondition of equipment and these checks must be documented.  These checks involve a complete check of \n\nthe equipment being filled including all safety equipment is in working order.  The safety director is \n\nresponsible for checking these for accuracy.  Any equipment found to be defective is put out of service \n\nimmediately or corrected on the spot.\n\n\nOur storage tank is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves and hose break-aways.  \n\nThese measures are i"
