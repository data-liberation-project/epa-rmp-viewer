Chlorine is used in the disinfection of the wastewater, while Sulfur Dioxide is used to remove the excess chlorine from the water before it enters the Neshaminy Creek.\n\nFour one ton cylinders for storage and use of chlorine are on site in the Chlorine building. However, there are never more than three cylinders with Chlorine in them at any given time. Three one ton cylinders for storage and use of Sulfur Dioxide are on site in the Chlorine building. However, there are never more than two cylinders with Sulfur Dioxide in them at any given time.\n  \nThe Authority has had an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in place since February of 1990. In accordance with Sara Title III, the plan is reviewed, updated and approved on a yearly basis. The plan contains detailed information dealing with Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide emergencies. Each employee has reviewed the plan and participates in yearly safety training or training as needed. A yearly update of the plan is provided to Bucks County Local Emergency Planning Commission, Doylestown Township, Chalfont Fire Department and the State of Pennsylvania \n\nThe worst-case scenario provides for the accidental release of an entire cylinder of either Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide in ten minutes at 200 lbs/minute. Utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp (TM) model, the wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec and atmospheric stability classF, the distance to the Endpoint Limit was determined to be .9 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario provides for the accidental release of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide from a relief valve failure in ten minutes at 1 lb/minute. Utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp (TM) model, the wind speed of 3 meters/sec and atmospheric stability class D, the distance to the Ednpoint Limit was determined to be less than .1 mile.\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred in the last five years. Prevention Program 2 subsections 8.9a and b do not apply. However, the co"

The anticipated completion date of this project is July 31, 1999, resulting in the discontinued use and storage of both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide."
