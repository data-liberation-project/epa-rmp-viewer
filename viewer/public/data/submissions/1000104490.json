In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a Methyl Formate and/or TDI release.

The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of a regulated substance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Carpenter Co. - Riverside facility maintains and operates a process system comprised of Methyl Formate and Toluene Diisocyanate, 80:20 TDI blend (80 wt% 2,4 TDI and 20 wt% 2,6 TDI) hereby referred to as TDI. Not including unloading of the regulated chemicals Methyl Formate and TDI to their respective storage tanks,there is one process these regulated chemical are involved in.\n\nPolyurethane Foam Manufacturing Process: Equipment for the regulated substances involved in the manufacturing of polyurethane foam include: four 55,000 gallon TDI storage tanks, two 12,500 gallon TDI metering tanks, one 10,000 gallon Methyl Formate storage tank, one Methyl Formate booster pump, one Methyl Formate pump metering skid, two heat exchangers, and multiple TDI transfer pumps. Both Methyl Formate and TDI are individually piped and do not come into contact with one another until they meet at the mixing head where the foam is poured.
