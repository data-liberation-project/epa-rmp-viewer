              "Description": "The wastewater treatment process at this facility utilizes two regulated toxic substances - chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide units are separate in that they perform different functions.  However, these units are similar in operational characteristics.  The chlorine unit is adjacent to the sulfur dioxide unit, with the two units sharing a chemical feed building and storage area.  The Safety Section of the prevention program addresses both chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety.  Material Safety Data Sheets for both substances are included.\n\nAlan Plummer Associates, Inc. performed the hazard review on December 15, 1998, and updated the hazard review on April 6, 1999 to review modifications of the chlorine feed system.  This review was further updated in June 2004.  The hazard review covered both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Safeguards for both were found to be similar.  The recommendations that resulted from the Hazard Review generally apply to both substances.  The Hazard Review demonstrated that the City's risk management program for regulated substances is excellent.  Many of the recommendations that resulted from the Hazard Review are procedural in nature.  Duck Creek WRC responds to hazard review and safety issues on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Operations, Maintenance, and Training elements of the Prevention Program have been addressed, as a result of recommendations of the Hazard Review, through development of a single Procedures Manual.  This manual provices a single source of information for most of the day to day aspects of operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems for the facility.  Other actions resulting from the Hazard Review were development and presentation of a two-day RMP training course and video and increased documentation of training.\n\nA Risk Management Program Compliance Audit was performed in June 2002.  All significant findings of the Audit have been addressed.\n\nThe incident investigation element of the Prevention Program was addressed by including a form to be completed should an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide occur.  Also included are instructions for developing a team to investigate an incident, should one occur.  To date, no reportable incidents have occurred.",

The facility is owned and operated by the City of Garland.  This wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 46,000 pounds of chlorine and 16,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68, are stored or utilized at the facility.\n\nSafety Policies:\nThe City of Garland is fully committed to safety at the wastewater treatment plant.  The City recognizes the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 6 requirements to further refine its safety program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the plant and the Garland Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, should a release occur.  Finally, the City is committed to continuing to improve its risk management program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Duck Creek WRC.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe City's commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide is demonstrated by its excellent track record with these substances.  The Duck Creek WRC has not experienced as accident related to chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years or at any time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nAir dispersion modeling for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide have the same radius of impact for the worst-case scenario.  Residences are located within the worst-case radius.  No other public or environmental receptors were found.  As required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysis also developed alternative-release scenarios for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Realistic potential alternatives were modeled, with considera"

The resulting radii of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description:\nThe City's prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances in the air are minimized.  This component is used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program has also become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel.\n\nThe Prevention Program includes seven primary components:\n\n*Safety Information:  Up-to-date safety information has been compiled related to regulated substances, processes, and equipment.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n*Hazard Review:  Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard review have been resolved in a timely manner.\n\n*Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures will also be updated should a major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\n\n*Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n*Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Process equipment for regulated substance processes is inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n\n*Compliance Audits:  The prevention program is audited at least once every three years to evalua"

The initial compliance audit was conducted in June 2002 and deficiencies have been addressed.\n\n*Incident Investigation:  Should an incident involving a release, or near release, or a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe City of Garland has determined that the Duck Creek WRC will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The Garland Fire Department will instead be the appropriate local emergency response agency in such cases.  The Garland Fire Dpartmnt has the necessary training to respond to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks.  Duck Creek WRC personnel have coordinated with the Fire Department to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan regarding response to a potential release.\n\nThe facility's employees have a significant role in the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Should a release occur or be suspected, employees responsible for working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop release using normal shutdown procedures.  Facility personnel receive ongoing training in identification of potential releases, and in how to determine when emergency response personnel should be involved.\n\nDuck Creek WRC continues to work closely with the Fire Department to ensure that emergency response, should it become necessary, is efficiently and safely carried out.  Coordination may include:\n\n*periodic meetings between operators and Fire Department emergency responders to discuss emergency response measures\n\n*periodic inspections of the facility by Fire Department emergency responders to ensure their familiarity with routes to the facility, ingress and egress routes at the facility and layout of the chlo"

Prior to March 1999, the Duck Creek WRC stored chlorine in a large bulk tank.  While the bulk storage tank was carefully maintained and protected, the City decided to modify the chlorine system to feed from one-ton containers.  Modifications were completed in April 1999 and the system was switched over at that time.  Other modifications, including improvements to the sulfur dioxide system have been completed since 1999.\n\nThe City of Garland will continue to improve its risk management program for the wastewater treatment plant by responding to the recommended changes outlined in the Hazard Review, by ongoing training of personnel, and by continued coordination with emergency response officials.  As the wastewater treatment plant grows to meet the growing demands of the City, further improvements in the treatment process will be considered to manage risks associated with these regulated substances."
