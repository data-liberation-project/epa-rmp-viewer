Executive Summary\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Corporation Pulp & Bleached Board Division is a integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility, located at 144 Main Street, Baileyville, Washington County, Maine. The facility employees approximately 586 people, producing approximately 1,100 tons of bleached hardwood pulp and 340 tons of uncoated printing paper daily.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific (G-P), Pulp & Bleached Board Division (Baileyville, ME) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for G-P workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Baileyville. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substance regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide) - see topic 1.3\n \n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.5\n \n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see "

When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment. In addition to equipment design, operating procedures and training are established for each covered process, minimizing the risk of any accidental release. \n\nG-P, Pulp and Bleached Board Division limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility is coordinating efforts with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that the community is well aware of and prepared for, emergency response in case an accidental release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at G-P, Pulp and Bleached Board Division/Baileyville consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.

The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances.\n\nThe prevention of accidental releases at G-P, Pulp and Paper Operations is accomplished by utilizing an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management program. The PSM program consists of a series of policies that address the safe operation and control of the covered processes. PSM policies and procedures help ensure safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the covered process, including training programs with personnel (Mill employees and contractors).\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release to the maximum extent possible. This will be performed in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help minimize affects to the public and/or the environment.\n\nG-P, Pulp and Bleached Board /Baileyville developed an Emergency Response Plan (Georgia-Pacific's Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan consolidates State and Federal emergency response requirements for emergency response in \"one plan\". G-P, Pulp and Bleached Board provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel. Also, G-P designates an Emergency Response Coordinator to oversee response activities for each type of incident, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organization.\n\nIn order to effectively implement the policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager, Pulp and Beached Board Division/Baileyville Operations.\n\n\n1.2 Georgia-Pacific, Pulp and Bleached Board Division/Baileyville and Our Regulated Substance\n\nGeorgia-Paci"

      "SummaryText": "fic's Pulp and Bleached Board Division uses a Kraft chemical pulping process to convert hardwood chips into approximately 1,100 tons of high quality bleached pulp and 340 tons of uncoated printing paper daily. Pulp bleaching is accomplished with utilization of Chlorine Dioxide Solution. The Chlorine Dioxide System includes the generation (production), storage and delivery of chlorine dioxide. The process starts with the ClO2 generation and ends at the point of injection in the Bleach Plant. \n\nThe ClO2 solution produced is stored in two identical storage tanks, each with a capacity of 176,000 gallons. The quantity of ClO2 stored in each tank, based on a maximum concentration of 14 grams per liter (g/l) (1.4% by weight), is 20,550 pounds (lbs). Because each tank will contain ClO2 in an amount greater than the threshold quantity (1,000 lbs), both tanks are covered by the RMP Rule. Chlorine Dioxide is considered a Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n1.3 Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nG-P, Pulp and Bleached Board Division/Baileyville performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that, (1) could be more likely to occur based on the accident history of similar processes in the industry or scenarios identified in process hazard analyses conducted for the covered process and, (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred. \n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances."

These requirements include:\n\n- one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (chlorine dioxide)\n- one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (chlorine dioxide)\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific, Pulp and Bleached Board Division/Baileyville\n\n\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process - Chlorine Dioxide (Cl02) Solution System\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System is the rupture of a single storage vessel that has a 176,000 gallons of solution, containing 20,550 lbs of ClO2 (1.4% by weight) The RMP Rule mandates, that for the worst-case scenario, the analysis assumes loss of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel instantaneously (ten minutes). The released chlorine dioxide would form a liquid pool and evaporate in a vapor cloud under defined worst-case meteorological conditions.\n\nThe maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA Look-up Table approach, is greater than 25 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 13,600 people live within this distance.

During normal operations, one pump is in operation. The pump could pump approximately 900 gallons per minute for five minutes before the release might be recognized and isolated. This scenario would release 4,500 gals of solution, or 525 pounds of chlorine dioxide (at 1.4% concentration).\n\nThe maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA Look-up Table approach, is 0.36 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 170 people live within this distance. Public receptors located within this distance include a high school, recreational parks, and churches. Environmental receptors located within this distance include streams and the St. Croix River.\n\n1.4. Administrative Controls & Mitigation Measures:\n\n1.4.1. Chlorine Dioxide Process:\n\nThe existing Chlorine Dioxide Solution System process came on line in July 1998. The process was all designed to control and retain accidental releases within the process area (ClO2 Plant Building).\n\nThe bottom floor of the ClO2 Building is provided with sumps, which are connected with the wastewater treatment system. Each floor of the building, and outside area of the tanks has ClO2 gas detectors. These detectors are activated when the ClO2 concentration is approximately 1 part per million (ppm) at the surrounding area.\n\nThe two storage tanks are located half inside, and half outside of the ClO2 Building. All pipes, valves, and process lines are located inside of the building.\n\nFor the worst case scenario, loss of the entire contents of one storage tank in 10 minutes, the tank, area layout and elevation were designed to avoid the formation of a liquid pool of ClO2.

The facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA's PSM prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. \n\n1.5. 1 The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Georgia-Pacific, Pulp and Bleached Board Division/Baileyville Program Level 3 Prevention Program that address the EPA RMP Rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System.\n\n1. Employee Participation: The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of G-P employees are addressed. The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities for all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n\n2. Process Safety Information: The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operatio"

The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technical data of the process, and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the processes. The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all G-P employees, and the LEPC. All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained at the facility.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, including non-regulated substances in the covered process. MSDS's for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the control rooms so the operators have ready reference to this information. In addition, MSDS's are provided to the LEPC and/or Plant Emergency Response teams for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\nMany of the operating parameters are included in the technical information to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazard analysis, and (3) to help maintain the equipment to the design specification.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis: G-P performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If\" technique, supplemented with a checklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and, when appropria"

Operating Procedures: G-P operators, supervisors, and engineers work together to develop and maintain accurate operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and upset operating conditions. The operating procedures include:\n\n- Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n    - Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n\n    - Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\nThe facility personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of the operations, including initial start up, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, start-up following a standby condition or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations. The facility reviews and certifies the operating procedures annually.\n\n5. Training:   G-P trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The facility training program for process operators includes both the initial training and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substance in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written tests and oral reviews are used to verify that the employee understands the training materials before the employee can operate the process.\n\nThe operators are consulted annually about the frequency of the training and the materials to be used for the training. Recommendations from the operators are reviewed and changes to the training are implemented as appropriate.\n\n6. Contractors: G-P has established a"

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. G-P explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the facility safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the facility. The facility requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site. The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n7. Pre-startup Safety Reviews: G-P performs a safety review of new or modified equipment in the covered process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely. This review confirms that:\n\n- Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\n\n- Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place.\n\n- Employee training has been completed.\n\n- For a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\n\nA pre-startup safety review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that the appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity: G-P maintains the mechanical integrity of the covered process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. The facility mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards"

Hot Work Permit: G-P has established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the facility. The facility reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit form to comply with these requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form. The supervisor reviews the completed form before work can be initiated.\n\n10. Management of Change: The G-P \"management of change\" program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be replacements in kind are allowed without completing a \"management of change\" form. All other changes must be confirmed through the full \"management of change\" program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of the process changes are prevented, safety consequences of the changes are addressed, affected process safety information and operating procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n11. Incident Investigations: G-P investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.
