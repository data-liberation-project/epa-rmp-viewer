The RMP describes the program developed by the City and its operator, OMI/Thames Water Stockton, Inc (OMI-TW). to prevent accidental releases of chemicals that could cause serious harm to humans or the environment and to reduce the severity of releases that may occur.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used and stored at the tertiary facility, located off state highway 4 at John Turk Road.  Aqueous ammonia may occasionally be used and stored at the facility, although the likelihood is low.\n\nTreated wastewater is disinfected with chlorine to meet the treatment plant's permit requirements.  Since ammonia is present in all domestic wstewater, the addition of chlorine to the treated wastewater forms chloramines, which is more stable and persistent than free chlorine.  If the ammonia level in the treated wastewater is too low to form chloramines, ammonia must be added to treated wastewater prior to chlorination.  Should this be required, the plant has the operational flexibility to store and use aqueous ammonia.  As a rule this step is not required and aqueous is not normally stored or used at the treatment plant.  \n\nAfter the wastewater is disinfected, it is dechlorinated with sulfur dioxide to remove any residual chlorine prior to discharge of the treated effluent to the San Joaquin River.  \n\nLiquid chlorine is delivered to the treatment plant in 90-ton tank cars.  The maximum inventory at one time is two tank cars.  Liquid sulfur dioxide is delivered by tank truck and then transferred to the storage tank.  The maximum intended inventory of liquid sulfur dioxide at the plant is one 5,150-gallon tank.  Aqueous ammonia is only ordered when it is determined that insufficient ammonia is present in the treated wastewater to form chloramines.  In this situation, liquid ammonia (19%) would be delivered by tank truck and transferred to a 5000-gall"

The policy emphasizes the need for employees at all levels to accept full responsibility for safety and to perform their job duties in a manner that will assure the safety of OMI-TW employees and the public at all times.\n\nEmployees must be aware of the hazards of their work and are properly trained to perform their job duties safely.  Management is responsible for directing the enforcement of safety regulations with the emphasis on proactive incident prevention.\n\nThe City and OMI-TW have developed and compiled written safety information to enable employees to understand the hazards of working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide. A process hazard analysis has been completed to comply with Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations under Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations.  \n\nChlorine Prevention Plan\n\nThe chlorination system provides for the addition of chlorine gas in solution.  The vapor pressure of chlorine in the tank car forces liquid chlorine through the supply manifold to the chlorine storage tanks.  Liquid or gaseous chlorine is then drawn from the storage tanks to the evaporators.  Expansion tanks compensate for liquid expansion resulting from ambient temperature increases.  Rupture discs between the manifold and the two outermost tanks burst at approximately 400 psi to relive pressure in the tanks and prevent pipe and equipment damage.  A pressure switch activates an alarm when the rupture disc is burst.  The temperature required to increase the vapor pressure to 400 psi is 180 F, which will not be seen at ambient conditions.\n"

Should the water temperature drop below this set point, the valve closes to prevent carryover of liquid chlorine to the gas metering equipment.  The chlorine pressure reducing and shutoff valve will also close on power failure or on pressure drop.\n\nSafety equipment includes a chlorine gas leak detector that activates an alarm if the chlorine level exceeds 1.0 ppm, and two 30-minute rating self-contained breathing units.  A Chlorine Institute Emergency Repair Kit ?C? is located near the chlorine unloading area for immediate accessibility.  \n\nEach chlorine tank car is double lined and are equipped with pressure relief valves set at 360 psi.  The cars are within a locked fenced compound and continuously monitored by gas detectors along the fence perimeter and at the rail car domes.  The compound is continuously monitored by video equipment.\n\nSulfur Dioxide Prevention Plan\n\nSulfur dioxide is delivered by tank truck to the storage tank.  The tank is protected from rupture by overpressure by two expansion tanks mounted on the storage tank.  In the event of overpressure of 135 psi, the presssure relief will release.  The temperature required to increase the vapor pressure of sulfur dioxide to 135 psi is 135 F, which will not be seen at ambient conditions.\n\nLiquid sulfur dioxide is fed from the storage tank to the sulfur dioxide building where it is evaporated into gaseous form.

A pressure relief valve on each evaporator vents the sulfur dioxide if the pressure exceeds 275 psi. The sulfur dioxide pressure reducing and shutoff valve will also close on power failure or on pressure drop.\n\nEach sulfornator shuts off the flow of sulfur dioxide in the event vacuum is lost for any reason.  Provisions are made for excess pressure or vacuum to be automatically relieved.\n\nOne ambient sulfur dioxide leak detector is provided at the effluent control building which activates an alarm if the sulfur dioxide level exceeds the set point of 5 ppm.  Another detector is provided at the enclosure surround the sulfur dioxide storage tank.  \n\nAqueous Ammonia (19%)\n\nIn early 2004, OMI-TW modified the treatment process to eliminate the use of ammonia at the tertiary facility.  Prior to this period, anhydrous ammonia was used on a seasonal basis when the level of ammonia was too low to create chloramines.  With the process change, it is anticipated that ammonia will no longer need to be added.  However, the facility has the flexibility to use aqueous ammonia (instead of anhydrous ammonia) if needed to meet the conditions of the plant's discharge permit.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, aqueous ammonia will not be used or stored at the wastewater treatment plant.  If needed, however, aqueous ammonia (19%), will be ordered.  It would be delivered by tank truck and transferred to a 5000 gallon storage tank located on a concrete pad adjacent to the influent channel to the dissolved air flotation (DAF) units.  \n\nAccident History\n\nDuring the past five years, the facility had one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  No one offsite was injured.  The process has been changed to eliminate the use of anhydrous ammonia at the treatment plant."
