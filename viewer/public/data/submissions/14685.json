Facility Accidental Release Policy:  The owners, management, amd employees of Grange Supply Company of Odessa, Odessa, Washington 99159-0187, with the liquid fertilizer operations at the West-end of the property at 202 West Railroad, Odessa Washington 99159, are committed to the prvention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency reponse plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event on an accidental release.  2.  Facility Information:  * The primary activity at the fertilizer facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers tofarmers.  * Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  * At Odessa the anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into an 27,500 gallon above ground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Odessa in storage @ 85% of capacity is 23,375 gallons @5.15 pounds per gallon = 120,381 lbs.  * At Odessa the Aqua Ammonia is transferred by tank truck and unloaded into 2 - 30,000 gallon above ground stroage tanks at the liquid fertilizer site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia in storage at 95% of capacity at Odessa is 57,000 gallons @ 7.6 pounds per gallon = 433,200 lbs.  3. The Worst Case Release And Alternate Release Scenario's:  a. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios - The worst-case release scenario for the Odessa facility is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 120,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonim,  whick represent the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.
