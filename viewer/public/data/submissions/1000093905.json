We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have contracted with an Industrial Refrigeration Contractor to perform our preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \n\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge the previous operator had no releases or accidents related to our ammonia refrigeration system within the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the CalARP California Accidental Release Prevention Program handled at this facility. \n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health \n\nAct's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule and CalARP program 3 requirements. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participatio"
