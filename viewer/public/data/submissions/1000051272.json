Overall, these programs prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels, which are interconnected and separate vessels, which are located, such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThere was 1 accidental releases of ammonia in the last five years.
