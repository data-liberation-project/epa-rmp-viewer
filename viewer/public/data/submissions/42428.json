ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AN DEMERGENCY RESPONSE;\nThis facility complies with OSHA 1910.38 and EPCRA requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Garner Fire Department and request that they respond.\n\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF OR FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE;\nOur primary business activity is storage and handling of grain commodities and we also provide farm inputs to agricultural producers in our trade area.  One of the farming inputs we supply is anhydrous ammonia which we store and provide to our customers.  The tank capacities and quantities stored have been shared with the North Central Regional Planning District and with the Garner Fire Department.  \n\n3.    WORST CASE SCENARIO;\nOur worst case scenario would be the rupture of the largest container on site in a single catastrophic event resulting in a toxic gas release.  The quantity of anhydrous released, the distance to endpoint and any public receptors within that distance have been shared with the North Central Regional Planning District and the Garner Fire Department.  \n\n4.    ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO;\nOur alternate release scenario would be the rupture of a transfer hose while an anhydrous ammonia transport is unloading at our facility.  The quantity of anhydrous released, the distance to endpoint and any public receptors within that distance have been shared with the North Central Regional Planning District and the Garner Fire Department.  \n\n5.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM;\nOur emergency response program has been coordinated with the North Central Regional Planning District and the Garner Fire Department.  \n\n6.    FIRE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY;\nWe have not had any recordable accidents in the last five years at this facility. \n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SA"
