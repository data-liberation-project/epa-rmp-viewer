Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nThe acetylene production area is equipped with a deluge system which can be operated manually or passively. The facility also employs plant emergency trip stations so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\n\nThe propylene system is equipped with an emergency shutoff switch which when  activated closes the tanks main isolation valves.  The propylene production area also incorporates the use of the plant emergency trip station.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe Indianapolis facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years.
