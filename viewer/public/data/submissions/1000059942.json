The procedures assure that the considerations found in 40 CFR \u00a768.75(b)(1)-(5) are addressed prior to any change.\r\n\r\nThose employees affected by the change are notified and trained on the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews will be conducted prior to startup of  any new stationary sources or any modified stationary sources, when those modifications are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review confirms that prior to the introduction of regulated substances to a process: construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for new sources, a PHA has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and modified sources meet the requirements contained in the management of change; training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nCompliance audits are conducted once every three years to verify that procedures and practices developed under the RMP rules"

Incident investigations are conducted by both on site and corporate EHS personnel.  Once the investigation has been completed, a report is prepared and includes those items required in 40 CFR \u00a768.81(d).\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees are included in PHAs and have access to PHAs that have been completed.

The hot work permit is written to address the elements described in 40 CFR \u00a768.85(b).\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nMartin requires that contractors participate in the safety programs implemented by the facility.  Contractors are evaluated based on safety performance prior to being selected to perform work at the facility.

The facility handles substances considered hazardous by the U.S. EPA and has implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to training and procedures, the facility has implemented a Mechanical Integrity Program, emergency shutdown systems and warning alarms.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Plainview Fire Department, and other interested authorities, to mitigate any release, inform all affected parties and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nMRI handles anhydrous ammonia for the production of ammonium sulfate fertilizer and control of SO2 emissions from the sulfuric acid plant.  Ammonia is transported to the facility via tanker truck and unloaded into pressurized storage vessels.  From the vessels, the ammonia is transferred via piping to the ammonium sulfate plant or acid plant.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is managed as required under RMP Program 3 (or Subpart D) and OSHA's PSM program.  Program 3 requires that MRI have the process safety information for the hazardous chemical, conduct a process hazard analysis (PHA), create operating procedures, conduct training, implement a mechanical integrity program, implement a management of change program, conduct pre-startup reviews, conduct compliance audits, conduct incident investigations, ensure employee participation, issue hot work permits, and include contractors in the release prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Saf"
