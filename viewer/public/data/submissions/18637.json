In 1985, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) managed about 275 million metric tons of hazardous waste at licensed Resource Conversation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites.  Hazardous chemicals are a serious safety and health problem that continues to endanger human and animal life and environmental quality.  Hazardous chemicals are materials that are toxic, flammable or corrosive, can cause fires, explosions, and pollute the air, water and land.  Unless hazardous materials are properly managed, treated, stored, or disposed of, they will continue to pollute the environment in an uncontrolled manner.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued a final standard entitled Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (29 CFR 1910.120), specifically developed to protect workers in hazardous environment and to help them handle and manage hazardous chemicals and wastes safely and effectively.\n\nThe Response program outlines the protocol in which the City of Aspen will respond to an emergen"
