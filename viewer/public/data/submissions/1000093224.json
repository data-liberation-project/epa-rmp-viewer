This RMP was prepared in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112r and associated regulations and ammendments CFR Part 68. This facility is a research and development faciliy to formulate soups, sauces, marinated meats for all Wegmans stores. This system uses approximately 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention\r\nThe refrigeration system for Wegmans Culinary Innovation Center is regulated by the OSHA standard for process safety management (29CFR 1910.119). Wegmans meets the requirements for PSM at this facility and has applied this program as the Program 3 Prevention program for this RMP.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the PSM requirements, refrigeration system operators conduct regular walks to assess system condition and operation. Items requiring attention are acted upon immediately. Less serious conditions are logged and remedied in a timely manner. Preventive maintenance is conducted based upon manufacturer's recommendations and using manufacturer's parts and instructions.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nThe Wegmans Culinary Innovation Center refrigeration system is monitored by ammonia sensors that are wired directly to Wegmans Corporate Asset Protection (Security Operation Center), who work closely with the Gates Fire Department. In the event of an ammonia release emergency, Asset Protection will contact the Gates Fire Department and request they respond. If necessary, the Gates Fire Department will request the Monroe County HAZMAT team to also respond.\r\n\r\nThe facility has written emergency procedures. Several members of Wegmans emergency response team are trained in the use of personal protective equipment and will assist the Gates Fire Department in accident mitigation and response. The Gates Fire Department has partnered with Wegmans personn"
