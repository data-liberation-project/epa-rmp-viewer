Escalon Cellars, located on Highway 120 in Escalon, California is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for its employees, as well as protecting the local community and the environment from chemical releases.\n\nPURPOSE ? BTQCL ? Escalon Cellars has developed an accidental release prevention programs for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, and flammable chemicals. Through review and analysis of the following elements, BTQCL-Escalon Cellars has examined methods to reduce the likelihood that employees or the community may be exposed to hazardous chemicals due to catastrophic release:\n\nElement 1 ? Hazardous Chemical Process Review ? examined the hazardous chemicals employed, mechanical systems? integrity and design, employee training, standard operating procedures, and auditing and inspection techniques employed. \n\nElement 2 ? Hazard Analysis Techniques ? examined the potential hazards present, consequences of the failure of engineering controls, human factors, and failure siting. The Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) technique was chosen and employed for this purpose. \n\nElement 3 ? Review of Past Accidental Releases and Consequences.\n\nElement 4 ? Off-site Hazard Assessment ? determined the off-site impacts of release based on worst-case and alternative release scenario analyses. The vulnerable zones for the release covered by highly hazardous chemicals were estimated using a computer assisted air dispersion modeling program.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES ? Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements are typically triggered by manufacturing, handling, using, storing, processing, or on-site movement of certain quantities (referred to as threshold quantities) of chemicals deemed as hazardous. At the BTQC-Escalon Cellars facility, anhydrous ammonia process is the RMP regulated substance.  Anhydrous "

Through hazard analysis techniques, BTQC-Escalon Cellars has updated and refined its standard operating procedures and process and instrumentation diagrams for all covered processes under RMP requirements. This information has been employed for providing more comprehensive training and a better understanding by operators.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY ? Since BTQCL Company is a new owner / operator, there is no accident history to report. \n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE MEASURES ? BTQCL-Escalon Cellar?s Emergency Planning and Response Program is included in the winery?s Hazardous Materials Management Plan and Injury and Illness Prevention Plan.\n\nFor emergency release of hazardous materials, employees have been instructed to evacuate the area and notify their supervisor. The supervisor will assess the situation and notify the local fire department to respond, if warranted. \n\nThe local fire department can contact the Ripon HAZMAT Team to respond to hazardous material releases in a safe and timely manner. The local fire department is invited to tour the winery?s hazardous material storage areas annually.\n\nEmployees are notified to evacuate by: 1) winery siren, 2) verbal instructions, and/or 3) two-way radio communication.\n\nIt is primarily the Security Department and Cellar Manager?s responsibility to make the proper notifications in case of an emergency release.\n\nImmediate verbal notifications to agencies upon the release of hazardous materials from BTQC-Escalon Cellars may include: local fire department (9-1-1); National Response Center (800-424-8802); California Office of Emergency Services (800-852-7550); San Joaquin County Environmental Health (559-468-3420); and the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board ?

The program documentation will be updated as needed based on the audit findings as well as to implement current programs that BTQCL Company has in place at other similar facilities."
