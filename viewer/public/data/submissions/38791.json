The ammonia refrigeration process at High Liner Foods (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention rule and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  High Liner Foods has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of compressed ammonia systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \n\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan as required under OSHA-PSM, and through close communication with the Portsmouth Fire Department, High Liner Foods has emergency response procedures in place which comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHigh Liner Foods is a fish processing facility engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The facility maintains approximately 38,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As High Liner Foods? anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at High Liner Foods is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards I"

Process verification takes place through design audits by certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications are at least once every three years.  Contractors were recently retained to evaluate the three main components of the process:  the ammonia receiver and scrubber; the transfer lines inside and outside the facility; and the evaporative condensers.  Potential process failures were identified and corrective actions were implemented. \n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of High Liner Foods? daily operations.  PM is performed on a computerized schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases, the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by High Liner Foods exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors in the engine room, cold storage, and above the accumulators in the production area, are tested every six months.  At least once per year all valves on the process are exercised (turned full open and full shut). Relief valves are replaced on a 5-year schedule.  Differential pressure gages are replaced immediately upon discovery of any damage which may breach the integrity of the compressed ammonia process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the last five years, High Liner Foods has not had an accident involving compressed ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in the engine room, cold storage, and above the accumulators in the production area.  A ?horn? evacuation signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm is also activated at ADT.\n\nIn the event of a process release, ADT calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn c"
