              "Description": "The manufacturing process for anhydrous hydrazine process includes all process vessels and containers starting from the raw materials (chlorine tank car unloading and ammonia pipeline) to the finished storage areas.  All process vessels are included.  Everything in this prevention program applies to the unit.  We conducted a PHA and have incorporated the results into the process.  We comply with OSHA's PSM standard (Operating procedures, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, etc.) which aids in the prevention of releases of these RMP substances.  We have area detectors to aid in the detection of a release.  We have systems such as tank dikes and deluge systems to aid in the mitigation of a release.  Our primary prevention program is the employees who operate our process. These individuals are well trained to operate the process in a manner that will not release hazardous substances into the environment.  The site production schedule for anhydrous hydrazine fluctuates to meet the needs of our customers. In some cases the Hydrazine unit may not run for a whole year, or it may run 6-7 month in a year.  Using the philosophy of making our facility inherently safer we reduce the amount of raw materials on site in times of non-production.  (example- remove Chlorine railcars from plant within 7 days of the end of production.)",

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that this site provide an executive summary in the RMPlan.  This summary provides the following items: \nAccident Release prevention and emergency response policies\nDescription of stationary sources and regulated substances at facility\nOffsite Consequence analysis results\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\nFive year accident history\nEmergency Response Plan\nChemical Specific Prevention steps\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nArch has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable  releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nArch is located in Westlake, Louisiana.  Our facility produces hydrazine in the form of hydrazine solutions, anhydrous hydrazine, dimethyl hydrazine and methyl hydrazine using a variety of chemicals and processes.  Because of the nature of our facility, anhydrous hydrazine, dimethyl hyd"

In some cases the Hydrazine unit may not run for a whole year, or it may run 6-7 month in a year.  Using the philosophy of making our facility inherently safer we reduce the amount of raw materials on site in times of non- production.  (example- remove Chlorine railcars from plant.)   \n\nThe Lake Charles site has the following EPA regulated toxics: chlorine, ammonia, hydrazine, dimethyl hydrazine, and methyl hydrazine.   The following EPA flammables are also located on our site: dimethylamine and methyl amine.  Dimethylamine and methyl amine are never stored on the site at the same time.  \n\nThe following are the maximum storage capacities that can be found on our site:\n\nChlorine                                            360,000 pounds\nAmmonia                                          140,500 pounds\nHydrazine                                      1,980,200 pounds\nDimethyl hydrazine                           176,500 pounds\nMethyl Hydrazine                              180,700 pounds\nDimethylamine                                   270,100 pounds\nMethyl amine                                     270,500 pounds\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\nArch's worst case release scenario involves a railcar of chlorine emptying its contents over a ten minute time period.  Using EPA's plume dispersion calculation  (Lookup Tables) and the most detrimental weather conditions, it is estimated that significant public exposures would be realized a significant distance from the source of the release.  This assumes Arch has not taken any steps to mitigate the effects of the release.  Arch has signif"

In the case of the alternate release scenarios,  we examined the following releases:\n\nChlorine-- a release of chlorine resulting from overfilling the reactor.  We estimate 84 pounds would be released with no offsite impact.\n\nAmmonia-- a release from our ammonia pipeline would result in approximately 1780 pounds released with no offsite impact.\n\nHydrazine--we modelled a release that actually occurred when a tank leaked and 490 pounds of hydrazine (as part of a hydrazine solution) was released into the environment.  The model estimated no offsite impact.\n\n1,1 Dimethyl hydrazine-- we estimated 1510 pounds would be released should a transfer hose fail.  This would have no  offsite impact.\n\nMethyl Hydrazine-- we estimated a pipe leak would release 1700 pounds and would have no off site impact.\n\nIn all of the above cases, the general public would not be affected.  Only industrial personnel from nearby facilities would potentially be exposed to levels equalling or exceeding the ERPG 2 published concentrations.\n\nArch  has also examined the effects of releases involving our regulated flammable chemicals. Our worst case scenario involves a railcar of dimethylamine exploding.  The effect of this blast would have no impact on residential areas, only industrial personnel from nearby facilities would feel the blast.  In our alternate case release scenario involving flammable substances, we estimated 1800 pounds would be involved in a vapor cloud explosion of dimethylamine or methylamine. The farthest impact zone would not affect the general public. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at ARCH.  Because processes at the site are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation, they are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nARCH encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each accident prevention element.  In addition, the site has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issue.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  These teams typically have members of management and union employees from various areas on the teams. \n\nThe first is our BASS team which uses behavioral based safety techniques  to change the basic structure of work.  This process has a mission to create a no-name no-blame environment that enables employees to change at-risk behaviors through education, observation analysis and feedback so all employees can enjoy an accident free workplace.\n\nARCH's GOAL is ZERO team is implementing an intiative aimed at developing an environment where the employee culture develops an intolerance for incidents in the areas of safety, environmental, transportation and process operations.  The team is composed of a cross-section of the plant population charged with developing an effective plan, training peers, setting good examples"

With the intention that employee participation provides the freedom to determine just what is required to achieve zero incidents.  Behavior based studies generated from  the BASS observations, as well as intense root cause analysis of incidents that do occur, are also components of the overall Goal is Zero effort. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nARCH keeps a variety of technical documents that contain key information which maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assiged responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  These documents are available to employees upon request.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion and known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, ARCH documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Standard Operating Instruction (SOI).  ARCH ensures the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nARCH also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a ba"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nARCH uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with a What-If checklist to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted by individuals with operating, maintenance and engineering expertise and facilitated by someone with PHA expertise . This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe findings of the PHA team are converted in action items/projects which are then assigned to the appropriate personnel.  PHA items with a higher risk are given priority status for implementation.  All action items are tracked until they are complete.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, ARCH conducts periodic reviews of  the hazard analysis.  These reviews are conducted at least every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented, tracked and retained.  Once again, team findings are converted to action items and other projects for implementing the team's suggestions. \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nARCH maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temperary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of ne"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The Management of Change process ensures operating procedures are updated as process changes are made.\n\nIn addition, ARCH maintains key process parameter documents that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readliy available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, ARCH has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees undergo a computer based training session.  After successfully completing this training, the new employee undergoes an on-the-job training segment where the employee must demonstrate competancy in certain job related skills.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  In many cases,  that training is refreshed annually.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nARCH uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment,  ARCH has procedures in place to ensure that all contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe  manner,  (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform ARCH personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to thei"

Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS (PSSR)\n\nPSSR are conducted for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features,  procedures,  personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nARCH has established procedures and practices to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans and (5) applicable work practices to help ensure that they perform their job in a safe manner.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nARCH has long-standing, safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a procedure for the safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others) along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE \n\nARCH has a comprehensive system to manage change to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nARCH promptly  investigates all "

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and publishes these results for the whole facility to see.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, ARCH periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.   Compliance audit are conducted at least every three years.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
