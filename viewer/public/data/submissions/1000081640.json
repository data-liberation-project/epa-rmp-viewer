The Chemours Co. - Corpus Chrisit Plant has an excellent safety record and accidental release prevention history.   There has been one accidental release of a RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years that meets the RMP resubmission criteria.  The accidental release resulted in an on-site employee exposure to a RMP regulated substance that was an OSHA recordable injury.  There were no off-site impacts as a result of this accidental release.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nOur program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program can be summarized as follows:  In order that plant personnel are prepared, an emergency response plan is in place and updated regularly and all employees are trained for their role in the emergency response plan.  Since site operates on a 24 hour basis, the operations personnel comprise the on-site emergency response team.  The emergency response team is led by the shift team leader who acts as the incident commander and emergency response contact.  There are eight shift team leaders and detail shift team le"

      "SummaryText": "aders any one of them is available at any given time to direct emergency response.  The plant participates in emergency drills, both on-site and off-site.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  The plant site is a founding member and active supporter of the Coastal Plain Local Emergency Planning Committee.  We coordinate our plan with the San Patricio County emergency response plan.  If a major release occurs, the emergency alarm is sounded and the site's emergency control center is activated.  The site incident commander and emergency response team responds.  Community emergency responders are notified as appropriate and mutual aid agreements are exercised when necessary.  Incident investigations and corrective actions are identified and implemented.  The facility security plan meets and exceeds the Maritime Security (MTSA 105) regulations.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe following is a list of improvements that are on-going at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\r\n - Continue to enhance the site's process hazard analysis procedure (risk matrices) to include guidance for conducting risk reduction analyses which will facilitate consistent risk reduction decisions among PHA teams.\r\n - Continue expanding the site's incident communication practice to include other incidents. Those events or situations that can lead to an incident or near miss so key learnings are broadly shared and recurring events are eliminated.\r\n- Continue to improve community emergency planning and preparedness by actively supporting and leading the increased involvement and education of responders from neighboring counties and municipalities in the local emergency planning committee.\r\n- Continue to strengthen and reinforce the strong employee mentoring program and safe work practices initiative.\r\n- Continue improvements to further strengthen the overall mechanical integrity and quality assurance program.\r\n- Continue to enhance th"

      "SummaryText": "TION STEPS\r\n* We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place are in compliance wih the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  For our efforts in safety excellence, the Chemours Co. - Corpus Christi Plant is recognized by the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program as a STAR Work Site since 1984.  The facility's environmental management system is ISO 14001 certified since 2003.\r\n* Our accident prevention and safety programs can be summarized into these elements.  Designing for Safety includes a documented process technology system covering the hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.  It includes an strategically located extensive accident prevention and mitigation system.  It includes the requirement to choose materials of construction to provide mechanical integrity.  It incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as alarms, interlocks, and gas detectors.  Transportation vehicles are designed for safe handling.  Maintaining Our Plant includes identifying all process safety critical equipment and perfoming routine inspections to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  High housekeeping standards contribute to safe operation practices.  Equipment specifications meet or exceed acceptable engineering standards.  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance on the systems.  Maintenance personnel are trained, qualified, and experienced in preventative and predictive maintenance.  Operating Safely includes the requirement for operators and mechanics to follow approved procedures.  The process is continually monitored by computer control systems and operators.  Railcar transfers are under continuous surveillance by trained personnel.  And, even the subtlest changes are properly designed and completely documented.  Auditing Our Operations inlcudes the requirem"
