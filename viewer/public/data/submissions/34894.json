The program in place covers all aspects of OSHA's CFR 1910.\n\n\n\nRCSS has a program for employees covering lockout tag-out and Personnel Protective Clothing (PPE), PPE testing emergency response training, and confined space training. Yearly inspections are performed on all aspects of the process.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nRCSS is a refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerant. It is located on Highway 10 North, 10070 Old Stage Highway, Smithfield, VA 23430. The warehouse, which was completed in 1988, is a 124,000 square feet facility designed to freeze and store frozen commodities. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two stage recirculated system. It utilizes a roof top evaporative condenser.\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is the high-pressure receiver, which can hold up to 3393 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. If this vessel was damaged and all 3393 pounds released over a 10 minute period (the required assumption by the Risk Management Program parameters), 200 PPM could reach 0.80 miles from the release point as calculated by the OCA Guidance Analysis. The liquid is contained in the Machine Room."

      "SummaryText": " There is no passive mitigation system to mitigate the release of gas.\n\n\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario, which is more likely, would be a pipe leak that could leak approximately 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within a 10-minute period. A toxic endpoint level of 200 PPM is 0.08 miles from the release point as calculated by the OCA Guidance Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe facility was designed so that material-handling equipment would not accidentally damage ammonia piping. The facility is controlled by a computer system that can assist in reducing the quantity of ammonia released. The computer system can be controlled from off-site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe engineers have been trained to follow the PSM program guidelines established for this facility. Employees participate in regular safety meetings, safety inspections, and annual training classes on ammonia safety.\n\n\n\nA preventative maintenance program and facility check lists provide routine inspection of the refrigeration system. An annual inspection following the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IIAR) guidelines is performed on the equipment.
