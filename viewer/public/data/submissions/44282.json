Pure Pacific has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Pure Pacific policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Pure Pacific Greenfield facility is provides product cooling, processing and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.  This processing includes cooling, cleaning, cutting and packaging vegetables. \n\nThe facility is located in a rural area of Greenfield. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (System). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, which includes two previously separate refrigeration systems (both of which were less than 10,000 pounds). With the system change to a common system, the inventory is now over 10,000 pounds. The ammonia equipment is located inside and outside.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Rel"

The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nPure Pacific\u00bfs Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Pure Pacific is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\nKey objectives of Pure Pacific Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2. Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Pure Pacific.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Pure Pacific certifies operators following completion of operator training and Pure Pacific\u00bfs confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all Pure Pacific employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Pure Pacific\u00bfs Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Pure Pacific has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Pure Pacific Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7. Verification of Pure Pacific\u00bfs compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Pure Pacific personnel.

Minimize employee injury and illness.  (Addressed under Pure Pacific\u00bfs Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Pure Pacific facility had one accidental ammonia release in the last five years, though there were no injuries, deaths, evacuations or damage known on-site or off-site.\n\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nPure Pacific\u00bfs Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the Greenfield facility.\n\nThis plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \nUnder Pure Pacific\u00bfs Emergency Response policy, Pure Pacific employees who have been trained as First Responders may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  Pure Pacific will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or refrigeration contractor).\n\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.\nKey recommendations identified during study included:\n\n\u00bfImprove the alarm notification system.  \n\u00bfDefine written PM Schedule, including \u00bffail\u00bf test of safety components.\n\u00bfEstablish more written procedures, including safe work practices and maintenance procedures\n\u00bfRequest review and letter from project Structural Engineers to confirm seismic design of building and ammonia equipment supports/anchorage.
