The plant comprises 550 acres of land located off Highway 332. The facility is located about 50 miles south of Houston, Texas and was initially constructed by Roche Vitamins in the early 1990s. The operations changed hands in 2003 when Roche decided to revise its business strategies and to divest the Vitamins and fine chemical activities. DSM purchased the division and incorporated it into their Nutritional Products Group.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nDSM Freeport Operations is highly automated and is one of the largest producers of beta carotene (pro-vitamin A) in the world. Surrounded by other large chemical plants, Freeport Operations is ideally situated for chemical operations. EPA RMP Regulated substances above the threshold quantity used or stored at this facility are anhydrous ammonia (toxic), acetylene (flammable), and flammable mixtures containing acetylene.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe site maintains an active role in the community emergency response activities as a member of the industrial CAER group, the county LEPC, and by maintaining routine contact with Clute and Freeport Fire Departments. The plant conducts routine training in the emergency response procedures and conducts drills at least quarterly. Notification of the community and the public is handled through the Industrial CAER group which maintains sirens, telephone communication, a radio station, as well as other communication means. Further community communications tools are evaluated by these organizations on a routine basis.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DSM Freeport site believes that prevention is the key element of all activities and measures have been incorporated to ensure safety and environmental protection. All levels of employees have the responsibility to exercise maximum "

It is the intent of the management of this plant to protect the environment while maintaining an effective operating plant. We believe that environmental protection is an integral part of and in no manner separated from, the operations of this plant. In recognition of this and in the interest of appropriate management practices, we will constantly work toward: proper operation of this plant in order to protect the environment, consistent adherence to required operating practices and procedures designed to prevent environmental incidents, conscientious observance of all federal, state and corporate environmental standards, minimization of the generation of all waste materials, and where feasible, dedication to reuse and recycle. \n\n\n\nThe site is currently governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and achieved the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program Star certification on April 19th 2004. Employees participate in all elements of these programs. The site achieved certification to the revised ISO Quality Standard (ISO 9001:2000) and added certification to the Environmental Standard (ISO 14001:1996) to its list of accomplishments in 2003.\n\n\n\nDSM Freeport conducts regular HAZOPs for the process to identify potential hazards as well as controls, systems, and recommendations to mitigate those hazards. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed. The facility maintains Operating Procedures and Process Safety Information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the facility. The facility also has processes in place for Training, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, Management of Change (MOC), Employee Participation, Hot Work Permitting, and Contractor Safety Performance to ensure continual commitment to safety.

Continual improvement is utilized by the site to pursue operational excellence. Being a true manufacturing center of excellence, Freeport is committed to the safety of our employees as well as the protection of our environment and community. The facility continually uses the MOC/ PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified. The facility also uses extensive facility siting procedures/requirements, to continuously evaluate personnel safety and process hazards."
