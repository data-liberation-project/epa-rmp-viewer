Accidental release prevention of anhydrous ammonia is a must in our operation. We have in place a continuing employee training and update program. As well and equipment and tank preventative update policy. In the past 5 years we have had no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Our Emergency Response Program has been presented to ourlocal Emergency responders which include local fire dept and the local ema director. As new technologies become available and economicaly feasible we will consider adding that to our preventive program."
