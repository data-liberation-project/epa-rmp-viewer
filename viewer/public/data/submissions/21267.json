Heartland uses and stores anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in their Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) in excess of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold Quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Heartland is implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  \n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for Heartland utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function  as the heat transfer medium.  The System contains five (5) high stage compressors, two (2) low stage compressors and three (3) booster compressors.  The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling on four (4) of the compressors and thermosyphoning oil coolers on the remaining six (6) compressors.\n\nThe System contains four (4) evaporative condensers to convert the high pressure ammonia gas into high pressure liquid. After the high pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory of 16,000 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia,  includes two (2) high stage recirculators which provide high temperature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes one (1) low stage recirculator which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.\n\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the low temperature accumulator to the suction of the low stage compressors.  The discharge from the low stage compressors goes to the high stage recirculators, which provide ammonia vapor to the suction of the high stage compressors.  The dischar"

The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the Heartland Refrigeration System in good operation.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases at Heartland during the last five (5) years.\n\nThe equipment listed below is inspected daily.\n\n  \u00bf  all refrigeration compressors\n  \u00bf all ammonia pumps\n  \u00bf all condensers\n  \u00bf all ice houses\n  \u00bf all heat exchangers\n  \u00bf all spiral freezers\n\nShould there be an ammonia release, the Itta Bena, Mississippi Fire Department (IBFD) will respond.  Should the need for an evacuation occur, the LeFlore County, Mississippi Sheriff's Department  will notify all households within a 1.5 mile radius.  \n\nAnnual in-house employee training programs maintain and continually improve safety at Heartland."
