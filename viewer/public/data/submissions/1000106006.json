Crude oil is delivered to the refinery via tank trucks, then processed and refined into various petrochemical products and commercial petroleum products such as jet-A, naphtha, and diesel fuel.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for the facility is 2911.  \n\nLazarus Energy has made safety their top priority.  Lazarus's commitment to safety is evident in their track record, which shows they have not had a major incident in the last seven years.  Senior Management has been highly committed to safety and implementing safety procedures.   They use the slogan of safety as their #1 priority and operate with the philosophy of doing the right things the right way. \n\nLazarus has a total of 3 covered processes.
