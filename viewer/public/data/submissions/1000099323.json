Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Lanxess Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nUnforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Union County Sheriff, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nOur Central Plant's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis. The facility operates five RMP-covered processes, which utilize four regulated substances. These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, and phosgene [carbonic dichloride]. The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization. \n\nBromine is obtained from brine and used for chemical synthesis. \n\nChlorine is used in the bromine replacement process. \n\nPhosgene [carbonic dichloride] is used for chemical synthesis.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\n\n\nThese scenarios include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  The worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process. The offsite consequence analysis was performed per 40 CFR 68.25 using EPA's RMP Comp. \n\n\n\nOne alternative c"

The analysis was performed per 40 CFR 68.28 using EPA's RMP Comp.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State of Arkansas Building Code. A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Central Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Hazards Operability study or HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Central Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the pr"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Central Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices carry out maintenance operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Central Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training by local supervision to deal with the modification.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Central Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Central Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigati"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the Root Causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Central Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. The Central Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  When contractor employees are brought on site before starting work they are required to watch the \"Contractor Safety\" video and annually thereafter.\n\n\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Central Plant had an accidental phosgene release at the TCO unit with a recordable lost-time injury on October 16, 2021.  The release occurred inside of a dedicated brick building with a designed ventilation and scrubbing system.\n\n\n\n6.

In addition, the plan is updated annually to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Coordination with the Union county Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Lanxess are aligned in their efforts to protect the community from accidental releases of chemicals. \n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Central Plant plans to continuously improve and update operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment to original specifications or design codes, and develop and implement safety improvement capital projects. These are some of the major steps we take to improve safety at our facility every day."
