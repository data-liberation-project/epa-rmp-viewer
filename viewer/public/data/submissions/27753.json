      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN ---- It is Valspar's policy to operate its plants in a manner which protect its employees, the public, and the environment.   It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Valspar Coatings-Garland has a detailed, practiced Emergency Action Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental release.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION and REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:    The Valspar Coatings Garland Site is a manufacturer of consumer paints, coatings resins, and a variety of coatings such as coatings for beverage containers.   Vinyl acetate is a key raw material in the production of Valspar's latex resins.    As a key raw material, the site maintains a reasonable inventory to respond to production demands.  Peak customer demand for latex resins may require the plant to store as much as 28,000 gallons in a storage tank.   This may involve the use of railcars to supplement raw material supplies.  Current inventory is typically below 15,000 gallons and orders are not placed until tank storage is below 10,000 gallons.   The facility storage tank is located in a concrete and earthen bunker, equipped with a dike capable of handling the entire contents of the vessel.   \n\nThe facility also has a warehouse which stores and ships consumer paint products.  The products include aerosol spray cans which utilize propane as the propellant. \n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:    The worst case scenario for VA is the release of the entire contents of a railcar into the containment dike.  This scenario will be unlikely due to the design, maintenance, and operation of the system.  According to the EPA guidance table for calculating the consequence of a VA release, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  At a distance of 0.4 miles, the EPA has determined the VA air concentration does not pose a threat to the public.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for propane is the release of the largest aerosol spray can.

      "SummaryText": "e largest container is a 16 ounce spray can which contains 0.4 pounds of propane.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp (TM) Version 1.02 software and EPA's OCA Guidance, the distance to endpoint is 0.006 miles or 18 feet.  Because of limitations in the software provided by EPA, the distance to endpoint had to be entered as 0.1 miles and the quantity of material released as 1 pound.  The actual amount of material released is 0.4 pounds which results in a distance to endpoint of 0.006 miles.  There are no public receptors within this distance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL PREVENTION STEPS:  The facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.  Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:   The Valspar Coatings Garland plant has never had an accident involving VA which resulted in injuries, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:   In the event of an emergency involving VA, it is our policy to notify the Garland Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.   Contact with the LEPC will also be immediately initiated.  Members of the fire department routinely inspect the facility as well as other federal, state, and local agencies.    We have contracted with a qualified emergency response firm to aid in the cleanup of a release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  We have an ongoing and continuing process to update and review our manufacturing process for safety considerations."
