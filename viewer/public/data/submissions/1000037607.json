      "SummaryText": "Since Hawkins, Inc was founded in 1938, the company has become a critical source of chemical products for\r\ncommunities and businesses across the upper Midwest. For example, municipal and industrial water\r\ntreatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for water disinfectants and other treatment products,\r\nequipment and expertise.\r\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Roseville, Minnesota, with branches that meet local needs in thirteen neighboring\r\nstates. The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water\r\ndisinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.\r\nHawkins has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan for its Tulsa, Oklahoma facility where its primary\r\nactivity is to receive and distribute packaged products such as chlorine for use by individual customer\r\nfacilities.\r\nThe Risk Management Plan that Hawkins staff has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool; it\r\nhelps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others. Risk Management Plans are developed by\r\nfacilities that have sufficient quantities of any of 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle\r\none of those materials.\r\nThe product covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is Chlorine. Chlorine and bleach (sodium\r\nhypochlorite) are well-known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, waste water, food processing\r\nequipment, swimming pools, etc.\r\n\r\nRisk Management\r\nHawkins provides products critical to meeting the region's public health and the manufacturing needs. Some\r\nof these products pose risks, which is why all Hawkins employees share a commitment to safety. Our safety\r\npolicy states:\r\nHawkins, Inc. recognizes its obligation to provide all employees with a safe and healthful workplace and to\r\nensure that operations do not impact neighbors. The Company has provided, and will continue to provide,\r\nthe human, physical and financial resources necessary to meet this objective. We expect"
