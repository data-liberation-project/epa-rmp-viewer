Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia.

Under normal conditions, the hydrocooler contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nSuction Accumulators\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulators is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulators receive vapor from the flooded accumulators and separate any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulators drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessels. Each main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulators contain low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessels\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessels is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulators. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessels reach the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the com"

The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers and the thermosyphon vessels. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to both the high pressure receivers and thermosyphon vessels. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nThermosyphon Vessels\r\nThe purpose of the thermosyphon vessels is to provide a supply of liquid ammonia necessary to cool the oil in the compressors. The thermosyphon vessels receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to the thermosyphon oil cooler on each screw compressor. Excess liquid in the thermosyphon vessels is piped to the high pressure receivers. High pressure ammonia vapor formed in each oil cooler is returned to the thermosyphon vessels. Under normal conditions, the thermosyphon vessels contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nOil Coolers\r\nThe purpose of the oil coolers is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through it.
