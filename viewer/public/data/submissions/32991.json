Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAnderson Development Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training in the processes at our facilities.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained personnel will respond to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our training and response efforts with the Gary Fire Department which provides additional emergency response administrative capabilities.\n\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nADC-Gary manufactures a range of specialty chemicals including styrene butadiene resins, urethane curatives, and high purity organic borate compounds.  We have one hazardous material at our Gary plant which is subject to the Risk Management Plan regulations.  Our maximum inventory of 1,3 butadiene exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nADC has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements.  Our Gary facility meets all requirements of State Building Codes and Indiana OSHA?s Process Safety Management standards for chemical processes, as well as the community Right-to-Know notification requirements of EPCRA and TRI.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program in place at the ADC-Gary facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information ? Detailed records of process safety information describing chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs are maintained for all proce"

      "SummaryText": "sses.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? Comprehensive HAZOP studies are conducted for our chemical processes to ensure that all potential hazards are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology for these logic analysis is generally a software package of ?what if? checklists.  The studies are performed by teams of qualified personnel from engineering, safety, management, and operations who are familiar with the operational details of each particular process.  The studies are revalidated at intervals of three years or whenever major process changes occur.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed.  \n\nOperating Procedures ? Written operating procedures are maintained for all processes.  These procedures cover initial startup, normal operations, temporary conditions, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and routinely followed by process operators.\n\nTraining ? Our comprehensive training program is the basis for certification of the process specific competency of each operator.  Refresher training is provided every three years at the time of PHA reviews.\n\nMechanical Integrity ? ADC performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure reliable operations.  Process equipment inspected includes:  reactors, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency generators and shutdown systems, pumps, and control systems.  Maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel trained and certified in maintenance practices.  All identified deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change ? Necessary process changes to chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures are made in accordance with methodical written management procedures.  Process operators and maintenance personnel are informed of and provided training to safely and reliably deal with necessary process modifications.\n\nPreStartup Safety Reviews ? Whenever startups of new processes or modifie"

Extensive reviews of all compliance aspects of accident prevention programs are performed every three years.  Prompt corrective actions are performed upon audit completion.\n\nIncident Investigation ? Any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in the release of a hazardous substance is promptly investigated.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of each incident as well as to identify any corrective actions to prevent releases from occurring.\n\nEmployee Participation ? Process safety and accident prevention are a team effort.  All process employees are included in discussions concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  All process employees have access to all information in the accident prevention program, especially information from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors ? ADC hires numerous area contractors to perform specialized maintenance and construction activities.  The safety programs and performance of all contractors are evaluated and continually monitored.  All individuals working for contractor firms hired by ADC receive annual safety training from ADC's Safety Department.  ADC informs all contractor workers of known potential hazards related to each project?s plan of action.  All contractors are also informed of emergency response procedures and required to cease working should an accidental release occur.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of RMP regulated chemicals from ADC?s Gary facility which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.

All emergency response equipment if regularly inspected and serviced.  The emergency plan is promptly updated to include response to any process changes.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nADC strives to continuously improve and update operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment to meet or exceed original specifications or design codes and to develop and implement safety improvement capital projects."
