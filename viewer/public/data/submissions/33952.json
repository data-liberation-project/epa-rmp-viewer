Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThe Pictsweet Company is committed to all federal, state and local laws on safety and health in the workplace. Pictsweet provides information to associates about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as Supervisor-Associate meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications.  \n\nAssociates and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training.  The training covers potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards. Each associate is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.  Associates must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.  Associates who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis company operates three cold storage warehouses and performs vegetable processing, freezing, and packaging"

The plan contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures, escape routes, critical operations shutdown procedures, procedures to account for all employees, rescue and medical duties assignment, means of reporting fires and emergencies, name of responsible person, alarm system, training and fire prevention.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility's RMP and PSM programs are works in progress and are constantly being reviewed and revised. Operating procedures and PHA's are reviewed periodically. Incident investigations are initiated and recommendations are made and followed through following any event that did or could have resulted in a release of chemical. The PSM program is audited by both internal and external teams. The findings of such audits are addressed. In order to stay abreast of the most current ammonia refrigeration safety news the company is involved in and monitors the proceedings of ammonia refrigeration associations and standards-setting bodies such as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Industrial Refrigeration Consortium."

      "SummaryText": "at this site.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide these cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is approximately 142,000 pounds. Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consists of a three temperature level, dual stage system which operates at -35\u00b0F, -20\u00b0F, and +15\u00b0F suction, and condensing with evaporative and shell-and-tube condensers at 160 lbs/sq. inch. Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for the engine room. The system provides cooling for three cold storage warehouses, a packaging area, plate freezers, belt freezers, and water chillers.  \n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nPre-startup Safety Review\nContractor Qualifications and Safety Programs\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one accident that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68 at this site in the past five years. The accident was caused by hydrostatic hammering of liquid ammonia at the dead end of a liquid header. The piping ruptured under stress and 3,000 pounds of ammonia were released from the system. The release did not result in any off-site consequences nor did any injuries occur on-site. As a result of the incident investigation of this release, the company modified the design of the system piping and control software to prevent future occurrences.\n\nE. Descript"
