Humboldt Creamery (Facility) is located at the intersection of State Highway 1 and State Highway 211, and is approximately 3 miles west of Fortuna, California. The site is situated adjacent to the Eel River. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the Facility. The system provides cooling for ice cream production and finished product storage. Humboldt Creamery utilizes a computerized Refrigeration Control System (RCS) to monitor and control the refrigeration system. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nHumboldt Creamery prepared the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) / Risk Management Plan (RMP) / Process Safety Management (PSM) program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the Facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the Facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility, Humboldt Creamery personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency actions to implement and relies on services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team. Humboldt Creamery will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the CalARP/RMP/PSM program.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe CalARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used b"

      "SummaryText": "y the Facility. Humboldt Creamery has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Humboldt Creamery ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to an Emergency Control Box. To prevent over pressurization, operators can manually equalize pressure of vessels or relieve pressure from the system by discharging vapor at the Emergency Control Box. Ammonia vapor released to control pressure can be directed to the relief header or mixed with water prior to discharge to the lift station. Additionally, pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves at or below the maximum allowable working pressure.\n\n\n\nOther safety features at the Facility include: \n\nAmmonia Detection System\n\n?    Ammonia detection sensors are installed in production areas and machinery rooms that have ammonia equipment\n\n?    There are eight locations with ammonia detectors that provide warning at 25 parts per million (ppm) and alarm at 50 ppm\n\n?    Production area sensors shut off liquid ammonia to equipment upon activation\n\n?    Ammonia detection system provides audible and visual alarm signals\n\n?    Additional ammonia detection equipment is installed in the engine room to shut down the system at 2 percent prior to reaching the lower explosive limit of approximately 16 percent\n\nEmergency shutdown and control systems\n\n?    Component specific safety shutdowns\n\n?    Safeties are tested annually\n\n?    Pressure relief valves on vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure are replaced at least every 5 years or if they are acti"

The Humboldt Creamery is a non-responding Facility. Facility personnel will initiate an evacuation and notify offsite responders in the event of an uncontrolled release of ammonia. The Fire Department or Incident Commander will take charge of the emergency response and response team and direct operations when an emergency is declared and will remain in charge until the emergency is ended.
