The WWTP de-chlorination system has a sulfur dioxide storage room and a sulfonation feed room.  Equipment at the facility includes liquid sulfur dioxide containers, sulfur dioxide gas manifolds, vacuum feed system, sulfonators, safety equipment, sulfur dioxide leak detectors and an emergency scrubber system.\n\n\tTypically twelve (12) one-ton containers of chlorine are on site.  Two (2) of the twelve (12) containers are hook-up online.  Eight (8) one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide are usually on site with two (2) of the eight (8) containers hooked-up on line and two (2) of the eight (8) containers hooked-up in stand-by mode.  The WWTP is manned twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, by a minimum of two operators capable of responding immediately to either a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak indicator alarm that may occur.\n \nC. Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as Worst-Case Release and Alternative Scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, stating that, the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel, one-ton container, is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative Scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis for the WWTP was conducted with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n1. Based on the tables and information provided for a worst-case chlorine or sulfur dioxide release, the following was determined:\ni. The Worst-Case Release Scenario, as defined by EPA, would be for a one-ton container of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to release, as a gas, in a ten-minute period.\nii. The toxic endpoint for the chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas is 3 ppm."

The distance from the release site to the toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles  (It should be noted that the design of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide feed system [vacuum feed] and the presence of an emergency scrubber system make the possibility of the EPA described worst-case scenario practically impossible.\n\n\n2. The Alternative (Release) Scenario was evaluated with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  For the WWTP a possible alternative release scenario would be a leak of chlorine gas from a flexible stainless steel tubing (pig tail) connection to a one-ton container.  Such a leak would not have an impact outside the facility boundaries.  The reason for this is because of the active mitigation measures that are in place.  These are:\ni. Vacuum feed system and pressure relief vents\nii. Building enclosure providing 45% reduction of the release rate\niii. Chlorine fixed detectors\niv. Emergency scrubber, that ventilates, captures and treats 99.9% of the chlorine gas.\n\n3. The Alternative (Release) Scenario for the sulfur dioxide system was evaluated with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  For the WWTP a possible alternative release scenario would be a pressure relief valve release of sulfur dioxide through 1/8-inch i.d. sulfur dioxide gas pipe.  Such a leak would not have an impact outside the facility boundaries. The reason for this is because of the active mitigation measures that are in place.  These are:\ni.

Accidental Release Prevention Policy\nThe Town of Ocean City Division of Public Works accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the US EPA Prevention Program are adhered too.  The Division of Public Works, Emergency Services and Emergency Management continue to evaluate and improve its procedures and practices with regards to its accidental release prevention policy.\n\n\tThe Division of Public Works and Emergency Management response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB. System Description and Regulated Substance Handled\nThe Ocean City Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) treats the wastewater from the Town of Ocean City and West Ocean City area and discharges the cleaned water to the Atlantic Ocean.  The WWTP is located at 6401 Seabay Drive (64th Street Bayside, west of Coastal Highway) in Ocean City, Maryland.  Disinfection of wastewater is part of the treatment process as required by both the EPA and Maryland Department of the Environment.  After disinfection is completed the chlorine is removed from the effluent stream with sulfur dioxide and the clean effluent is discharged to the Atlantic Ocean via the outfall pipe.  This process is known as de-chlorination.  Both the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are regulated by 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are stored and handled at the WWTP for the disinfection (or chlorination) and De-chlorination processes.  The WWTP chlorination system has a chlorine storage room and a chlorination feed room.  Equipment at this facility includes liquid chlorine containers, liquid chlorine manifolds, chlorine liquid evaporator, chlorine"

Five-Year Accident History\nNo reportable accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\nThe WWTP has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Town of Ocean City Public Works Division and Emergency Management, which include the Public Safety Group (Fire Company, Emergency Medical Services, Police, Coast Guard, Hazardous Materials Team, Emergency Management, Risk Management and Public Works Division).  The program includes an organizational structure of emergency responders and their responsibilities.  Emergency response to a leak at the 64th Street WWTP would include selected and trained personnel from all the Public Works and Public Safety Groups.  Emergency-response drills and emergency-response procedure evaluations are conducted annually.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nHandling procedures and emergency response procedures will be evaluated annually over the next five years.
