      "SummaryText": "International Paper owns and operates a large Bleached Paper Board mill in Augusta, Georgia. The mill is fully integrated: from incoming wood to Kraft pulping process to coated final product.\n\nAll aspects of safety and environmental stewardship, are top mill and corporate priorities as stated in the Corporate Agenda:\n  =Vision - We will be responsible members of the communities where we live and work.\n  =Principles of Excellence \n        -We respect and protect the environment, and the health and safety of\n         our fellow employees.\n        -We are good citizens who actively participate in our communities.\n   =Corporate Goals   - Accident-free workplace.\n                      - Continuous improvement in environmental performance.\n                      - Elimination of environmental incidents.\n                      - Active involvement in communities where we live and work.\n\nThe regulated substances used at the mill are Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide. Chlorine is used in the treatment of water for the mill operations; and Chlorine Dioxide is manufactured on-site for bleaching of wood pulp. \n\nThe worst case scenario in this RMP assumes the release of the contents for the largest storage tank.  The entire quantity of the 1% chlorine dioxide solution is assumed to spill instantaneously into a diked area and then evaporate at a rate determined by the model.  The worst case atmospheric conditions are assumed in this scenerio.  With this 2009 resubmission, the dispersion model was updated to the DEGADIS Model.\n\nThe most likely release scenerios would have no offsite impacts, but we can envision a alternative release scenerio with both chemicals that would have off-site impacts. With these alternative release scenerios, atmosheric conditions are assumed to be normal.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Chlorine Dioxide would be the breakage of a process pipeline between the solution storage area and one of the bleach plants. Assuming that the delivery pump could not be s"

      "SummaryText": "hut down it is expected that the discharge would last for 30 minutes before the mill's Emergency Response Team could suit up and stop the flow. The alternative release scenario under the above assumption was modeled and the potential impacted area includes receptors such as residences and other industrial sites. In actual fact the loss of flow would trigger the alarms in the bleach plant, the reason for the alarms would immediately be investigated and the system would be shut down in much less than 30 minutes. Also, while the spill would be outside of the storage tank containment area, The Emergency Response Team would be deluging the spill with water to lessen the impact of the release.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Chlorine is the cylinder relief plug fails one of the ton cylinders at the water treatment plant. Under this scenario the opening in the cylinder would allow the liquid Chlorine to escape and vaporize, taking 8 minutes to leak down. The model used to determine impact is EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) model using normal atmospheric conditions. The model indicates that such a release has the potential to impact neighboring industrial sites and very limited residential areas.\n\nBoth of the toxic chemicals discussed above are also covered under the mill's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Being a part of a PSM program, enhanced training for both operations and maintenance personnel is in place for all of the covered processes as well as the Distributed Control System alarm systems to alert operations should the covered systems develop leaks or more major faults.\n\nTraining and preparation for a release include on-site emergency response teams for each shift, trained to the Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) technician level. These teams receive annual 40 hour training at an off-site fire academy and drill monthly under the direction of the in-house fire chief. There is a site emergency response plan, emergency operations center and on-site medical departmen"
