Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Union Ice to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Union Ice implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility is located at 6100 E. Sheila Street in Commerce, California.  The facility is situated approximately 0.25 miles west of the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) near the Washington Boulevard exit.  The facility was constructed in phases between 1954 and 1973.  The facility, which covers 13.3 acres, also includes building space for tenants.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is primarily commercial/industrial with some residential areas to the north.  \n\nThe primary business of the Union Ice facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for food products such as meats, fruits, and vegetables.  In addition, the facility also manufactures and packages party ice.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consists of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low"

Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (6\" Hg) to 30 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 140-160 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\n3.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\na.  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\nb.  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\nc.  California's Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Union Ice to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Union Ice's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has"

      "SummaryText": " been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will send an alarm to an off-site monitoring company if an ammonia release is detected.\n\n4.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on a review conducted as part of the Hazard Assessment (June 2004), there have been two ammonia-related incidents: January 29, 2003 and April 30, 2003. The January 29, 2003 incident was due to a failed tube in Ice Machine #5. Approximately 800 pounds of ammonia were released. Local responders were notified and employees in the immediate area were evacuated. No offsite consequences occurred.\n\nOn April 30, 2003, a failed joint between a valve and pipe caused a release of approximately 80 pounds of ammonia. Local responders were notified and responded to the facility. Personnel in the area were instructed to shelter-in-place. No offsite consequences occurred.\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  1). save lives;  2) minimize and avoid injuries; 3) protect the environment; and 4) minimize property damage.\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedure"

Several analyses have been conducted at this facility including the following: \n\na.  Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\nb.  What If Analysis;\nc.  seismic assessment; and\nd.  series of safety checklists.\n\nAs part of the PHA revalidation of the previously conducted studies and the analysis of recent modifications to the refrigeration system, recommendations were made to improve the overall safety of the system.  The key planned changes to the system include a continued effort to improve upon all elements of the PSM / RMP program."
