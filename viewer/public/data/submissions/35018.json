The plant is a conventional turbidity removal plant that utilizes chemical coagulation,flocculation,sedimentation and filtrationto remove suspended particles from the Raw River Water of the Ky. River. Our facility has had a great record on Chlorine Safety over the past five years, We have had no accidental releases in the past five years. Our prevention program consist of an on site Ground Water Protection Plan (Permit Number KPDES  KYG640081)  That shows we make a official Monthly inspection of the GWPP and an every two hour Operational inspection of the chemicals listed as operational chemicals in the GWPP .In addition to the GWPP we are part of the Jessamine County Emergency Operation Plan.  Hydrofluosilicic acid is mentioned in the Jessamine EOP but ours is 23% and not 50% and not a Regulated Toxic Substance and it is not  in our RMP.

Nicholasville is 6 miles west of the water plant. Water plant southeast to Richmond is 7 miles. We would recommend mass evacuation depending on the severity and the quantity. Have 911 notify Madison County. There would not be necessity to have in-place sheltering due to evacuation of the public. Ref. Jessamine County EOP, Annex F for sheltering and Annex EE for evacuation procedures. Re-entry into the area will be restricted until officials deem the area safe. Only the Incident Commander will authorize re-entry. Area hospitals in Lexington possess the capability to decontaminate and treat patients exposed to the chemical. EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT ON HAND/TRAINING/EXERCISING: Two S.C.B.A. and a ton cylinder repair kit are on site. Emergency phone number 1- 800-6546 and 911 are posted. Procedures are in place for Leaks, spills and evacuation purposes for employees to study. Community: Refer to the Jessamine County Emergency Operation Plan, ERIL, for county emergency response equipment available to respond to a release at the facility. Local emergency response personnel are trained to OSHA 1910.120 awareness, operations and technician level. Jessamine County has established exercise schedule, which includes three (3) functional, and one (1) full-scale exercise every four years of which the Nicholasville Water Treatment Plant personnel are willing to take part in annual training exercises with city fire and local DES staff.  SPILL CONTAINMENT/CLEAN-UP/DISPOSAL: A release of HFS would most likely be contained to the respective storage room and would not need to be contained and collected by plant personnel. Chlorine will vaporize immediately but can be exhausted outside from its storage and usage area; however, following any chemical release, those personnel-taking place in confinement or containment would need to be decontaminated.
