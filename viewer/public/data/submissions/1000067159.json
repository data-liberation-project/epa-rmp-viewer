      "SummaryText": "The City of Mount Holly and the Mount Holly Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel are committed to the safe operation of the wastewater treatment facility.  The plant uses chlorine to disinfect wastewater to maintain public health, and sulfur dioxide to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to discharge. This is to protect the receiving stream water quality.\n\n \n\nThis facility treats 2.0 to 2.3 million gallons of influent wastewater each day.  The design of this facility does allow the potential to treat up to 4.0 million gallons per day.  The wastewater is biologically treated through an extended aeration process and disinfected via chlorination.  In the disinfection process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution.  The treated wastewater is allowed to mix with the chlorine solution in a contact chamber, killing pathogens that are dangerous to humans, animals and aquatic life that remain after biological treatment. The wastewater is then treated in a similar manner with a mixture of sulfur dioxide and water in a contact chamber to reduce the chlorine content prior to discharge. This is done to reduce the chlorine level to acceptable discharge limits before discharge to the Catawba River\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are regulated toxic chemicals by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine and 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Mount Holly Wastewater Treatment Plant stores a maximum of four one-ton chlorine cylinders (approximately 8,000 pounds of chlorine), and three one-ton cylinders (6,000 pounds) of sulfur dioxide; and, is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide also makes the facility subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements.\n\n\n\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The alternative toxic release scenario is "

      "SummaryText": "a slower release approximated as a one square inch hole 12 inches below the liquid level of the a cylinder.  Again, this would involve a release of 2000 pounds, over a longer period of time.  These releases could affect local populations.\n\n\n\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  All tenets of the Process Safety Management program are included by reference into this RMP.\n\n\n\nAspects of the release prevention program include written operations procedures, inspections of equipment, employee training, automatic shutoff equipment,  a chlorine gas detection monitor and alarm, and a separate sulfur dioxide detection monitor and alarm system.  As a testament to these programs, the Mount Holly Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had a chlorine nor sulfur dioxide release in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency response to accidents and releases is coordinated with the Gaston County LEPC.  In the event of a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify the LEPC and evacuate the facility.  Trained LEPC staff will evaluate the situation and make further decisions.\n\n\n\nAgain, the City of Mount Holly is committed to operating all of its facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  Compliance with these regulations is only a portion of the city's commitment."
