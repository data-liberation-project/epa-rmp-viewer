Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Pactiv are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of  processes involving regulated substances.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \r\nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket.  We have one substance present at our facility which is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is butane; and is referenced in this document by the term regulated substance.  The regulated substance at our facility is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  These products are also often referred to as blowing agents or expansion agents .\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard.  A number of processes at our facili"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nPactiv maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our covered process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Seismic activity consequences and prevention activities are considered during HAZOP studies.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Pactiv maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nPactiv utilizes a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these covered processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every  two years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nPactiv carries out routine, periodic maintenance inspections and preventive maintenance on covered p"

Releases of regulated substances are only responded to by on-site Pactiv personnel if incidental.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our covered process.   In addition, emergency response equipment (fire extinguishers, etc) is regularly inspected and serviced. \r\n\r\n6. Continuous Improvement of Safety\r\nOur primary goal for Pactiv is to protect the safety and health of our associates, the users of our products and the community in which we operate.  Our facility has exemplary occupational safety and health programs which encompass employee involvement, recognition for safe work, partnership with OSHA and continuous hazard identification activities.  Continuous improvement efforts have evolved from basic compliance inspections of equipment and facilities and measuring frequency rates, to that of behavioral observations, trend analysis, networking between various peer groups and focus on the quality and value of our efforts to create the desired results."

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections  are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures at Pactiv are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Covered process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pactiv.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nPactiv conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the requirements set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nPactiv promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a potential release from reoccurring.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facilities implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\r\n\r\nHot Work \r\nThe facility maintains a hot work program and issues a hot work permit for hot work conducted on or near the covered process.  Hot work is performed by qualified personnel who complete each permit and fulfill its requirements prior to the start of a hot work operation.  These permits are kept on file until the conclusion of the hot work operation.    \r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractorA\u00bfs safety performance and program is carried out.
