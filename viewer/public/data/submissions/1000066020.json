As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol-ICP completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that is stored in quantities above the applicable RMP reporting threshold. \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Facility produces fuel, beverage, and industrial grade ethanol from corn using a dry mill process. The fuel and industrial ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) to render the distilled alcohol unfit for human consumption; denaturant (natural gasoline) is added to the distilled alcohol at a concentration of approximately 2 percent by volume. Pacific Ethanol-ICP intends to use natural gasoline as a denaturant, which is a flammable mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated components above the threshold limits: iso-pentane, pentane and butane.  The maximum amount of denaturant (natural gasoline) on-site is estimated to be 666,689 pounds. The denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in an above ground storage tank with an internal floating roof as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the process of loading a barge, railcar or tanker truck.  The denaturant tank is located in the center of the facility at one of the tank farms, which includes secondary containment. Pacific Ethanol ICP has evaluated worst and alternative case scenarios as it relates to this reportable substance. Emergency response actions for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented. Pacific Ethanol-ICP has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  Pacific Ethanol-ICP also has a trained HazMat Team made up of management, maintenance, and operations pe"

The denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in secondary containment to minimize the potential for off-site migration of spilled material and to allow for prompt response in the event of a material release. It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol - ICP to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of natural gasoline, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol - ICP to notify the Tazewell County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Pekin Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the Facility, as needed based on the extent of the emergency.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nPacific Ethanol-ICP maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of natural gasoline. The Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is very similar to the prevention program required under Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM). Pacific Ethanol-ICP's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility's PSM Plan. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nPacific Ethanol-ICP has not had any accidents related to the RMP-regulated substances which may have caused onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nPacific Ethanol-ICP has a written emergency response plan that provides guidance to ensure employee safety in the event of an emergency. In general, the ERP provides procedures for employees to report a fire or other emergency; procedures for response actions, emergency evacuation; procedures to for employees who remain "

In addition, the Facility has coordinated with the Tazewell County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is a part of the written community Emergency Response Plan. The Pekin Fire Department provides first response for all Facility emergencies. A site map, SDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained by the Facility.  Pacific Ethanol-ICP has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  Pacific Ethanol-ICP also has a trained HazMat Team made up of management, maintenance, and operations personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nPacific Ethanol-ICP will have completed a Compliance Audit in October 2017 and a Process Hazard Analysis in September 2017.  The actions from these activities will improve safety at the facility and should be completed by December 2018. Pacific Ethanol-ICP standard operating procedures are currently under review and evaluation with an anticipated completion date of October 31, 2017\n\n\n\n"
