      "SummaryText": "The Joseph B. Blake Water Treatment Plant (WTP) of the Centennial Water and Sanitation District (CWSD) stores chlorine in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a Risk Management Plant (RMP) is required.  Chlorine is used at the WTP primarily to disinfect the drinking water prior to distribution.  The WTP also stores ammonia, but maximum inventory is well under the RMP threshold quantity, and is not regulated under RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP consists of three compliance programs; each with progressively stricter compliance standards.  The chlorination process at the WTP is subject to Program 2.  Program 2 consists of three major parts.  The first part is the Hazard Assessment, which is performed to determine the effects of a release of a regulated substance on the public.  The second part is a Prevention Program, which consists of seven elements designed to improve the safety system and decrease the likelihood of release.  The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which deals with an release if one should occur.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment includes examining the WTP's 5-year accident history, as well as worst-case and alternate-case scenarios.  The WTP's accident history of the chlorine system reveals that no accidents have occurred within the past five years.  The toxic endpoint, a location at which an individual could be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm for up to one hour - is determined using the Environmental Protection Agency's RMPCompA? computer program.  An estimate of the population effected by a release of chlorine is also determined, in addition to sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nRMPCompA? determines the radius to the toxic endpoint at 1.3 miles using conservative assumptions.  The worst-case scenario assumes that 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released during a period of ten minutes, although the property of chlorine causes a freeze-and-thaw cycle that would decre"

Additionally, the cloud from a chlorine leak would disperse relatively quickly, which would further decrease the possibility an individual within the toxic endpoint to be exposed for the assumed period of one hour.\n\nAlternate-Case Scenario\n\nAn alternate-case scenario involving a chlorine release through a broken valve during unloading is also evaluated.  RMPCompA? calculates the radius distance of this scenario at less than 0.1 miles.  This alternate-case scenario is considered to be more representative of the effects likely in the event of a release and the assumed meteorological conditions are less conservative than those used in the worst-case scenario.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe RMP includes a Prevention Program, which consists of seven elements designed to improve the safety of the system and decrease the likelihood of a release: Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audit, and Incident Investigation.  \n\nA new Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was conducted on April 7, 2009 to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases at the WTP.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WTP has and Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the water and wastewater treatment plants.  The plan is a controlled document with limited distribution.  Three copies of the ERP are maintained by the CWSD Director of Water and Wastewater Operations, and the Douglas County Sheriff and Littleton Fire Rescue have one copy each."
