All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Creek WRF utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before it is returned to the Ocmulgee River.  Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation and electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\r\n\r\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical \u00bftoxic endpoint\u00bf.  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \u00bfthe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.\u00bf  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Creek WRF Risk Management plan includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOperator Training\r\n\u00bf\tPreventive Maintenance Program\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Specific Safety Equipment\r\n\u00bf\tSafe and Effective Standard Operating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Review of Equipment and Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tAuditing and Inspection Programs\r\n\u00bf\tComprehensive Management Program\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Creek WRF has an acti"
