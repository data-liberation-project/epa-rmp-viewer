Visual inspections are conducted with each delivery to insure that the chlorine cylinders are in good shape prior to connecting them to the chlorine feed system. The staff monitors the chlorine use on a daily basis using scales to weight differentials to determine use. The system uses automatic pressure monitoring and alarm devices to alert operations staff of problems with the chlorine feed system. The facility plans to have only one 1-ton chlorine cylinder valve open at any one time.",

Berea's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is this facility's written policy and procedure to call the Berea Fire Department and notify the Madison County LEPC.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Discussion:  The facility provides water for the City of Berea, Berea College, and customers in Southern Madison County and Eastern Garrard County. The facility stores chlorine in a maximum of four 1-ton chlorine cylinders.  Typically, the largest volume of chlorine in storage at any one time is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is used in the water treatment plant to supply up to 4 million gallons of water per day to  the City of Berea, Berea College, and customers in Southern Madison County and Eastern Garrard County.   The system consists of a storage tank room, chlorine feed system, chlorine vacuum system,  and a safety air monitoring system (for chlorine).  Chlorine is an extremely toxic substance but the remote location of the facility reduces the likelihood of public risk in the unlikely event of a leak or spill.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps:  The installation of the chlorine system was a result of the new water treatment plant installation in 1990.  The facility installed the system according to recommendations by the Chlorine Institute, applicable standards, and applicable Federal, State, and Local code.  Individual components of the chlorine delivery and feed system comply with NEC, NEMA, ASME, and Chlorine Institute recommendations.  The chlorine storage and feed system is located in a locked room with a manual exhaust fan and vent "

      "SummaryText": "that is used during staff entry into this location.  The chlorine cylinders are delivered by Univar, chemical and cylinder inspection, testing, and certifications are maintained by this vendor.  Installation included the use of mechanical and electrical equipment specifically designed for chlorine service.  A chlorine gas sensor is located in the chlorine storage room to alert staff of a release prior to entry to this room.  This sensor has a remote alarm that alerts the operator via beeper 24-hours per day.  \n\n\n\nAll operators receive annual training to maintain their certification as water treatment system operators.  Training is monitored by the Kentucky Public Safety Commission and the Kentucky Division of Water.  Training consists of classroom training in the areas of safe system operation, water quality monitoring, routine water system monitoring and control, and general water treatment plant operation.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no major releases of chlorine from this process in the last five years that had any environmental impact.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility's policy is to immediately call the Berea Fire Department and the Madison County Local Emergency Planning Committee in the event of an emergency involving chlorine at this facility.  The local responding agencies have reviewed the facility's system and the Berea Municipal Water Treatment Plant invites these responding agencies to conduct onsite awareness and inspection tours whenever possible.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  The Berea Municipal Water Treatment Plant has completed a renovation and upgrade (2010).  In the process, the chlorine storage and feed room was renovated to include installation of new chlorine feeders and a new ventilation system. No major safety initiatives are planned in the near future."
