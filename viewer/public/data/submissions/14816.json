THE FACILITY \n\n      THE  OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF BLOMKEST FERTILIZER INC. ARE \nCOMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\nIF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE \nLOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE\nTHE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIROMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILTY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR\nSALE TO FARMERS. \n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n    THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 280,000 POUNDS WITH OUR\n30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED\nWOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE\nOF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK  RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE\nMAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 131,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME\nOF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE \nDISTANCE THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12  MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD\nREVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE \nENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM ) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM. \n\n    THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE \nAND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL\nSTANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCC"
