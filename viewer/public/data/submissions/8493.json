      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nCity of Maryville \nWater Filtration Plant\nJune 1999\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Maryville Water Filtration Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the City of Maryville Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is, as the name describes, a water treatment facility serving Blount County. Chlorine is the one regulated substance present at the facility. Chlorine is maintained in 150 pound cylinders and is used in the treatment of drinking water.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine is 2550 pounds. \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nTo perform the required off site consequence analysis for the facility, we have used the software program, RMP*Comp, provided by the Environmental Protection Agency. The program provides the calculations needed for the analysis. \n\nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. \n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from the Water Treatement Plant. The release scenario consisted of 600 pounds of gaseous chlorine being released simultaneously from four 150 pound cylinders in a ten minute time period. Under worst case weather conditions namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.  The toxic end"

      "SummaryText": " point for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. This type of release could have a considerable off site impact. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of  150 pounds or 1 cylinder of gaseous chlorine released in a ten minute time period. Under neutral weather conditions, Class D, and 3.0 m/s windspeed the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles. This type of release would not have an impact off site.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario was selected because the most likely event to occur would be a break in a connection or pigtail on the cylinder. This type of release would be limited to one cylinder. Procedures and preventative maintenance have been established to reduce the possibility of this event. Chlorine detection units are installed and allow for quick detection of chlorine leaks. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency. This facility is also subject to the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nThe following section briefly describes the elements of our release prevention program.\n \nProcess Safety Information \nThe City of Maryville Water Filtration Plant maintains a detailed record of the written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses was a What If/Checklist. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the Water Filtration Plant mainta"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining\nThe facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees operating covered processes are completely competent in the operating procedures. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: piping systems, relief and vent systems and controls. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted. These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations. \n\nCompliance Audits\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions re"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe management of the Water Filtration Plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning safety issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the implementation to the RMP rule. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, we hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Contractors are informed of the potential hazards related to the work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of procedures for emergency response in the event that an accidental release should occur. \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years . However, there has been one accidental release during this period. It involved a small chlorine release during changing of chlorine cylinders. Employee retraining has been implemented. \n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response. We have coordinated with the City of Maryville Fire Department in the event of a release.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility plans to continue improving their prevention programs in all areas to ensure employee, environmental and community safety."
