              "Description": "The Silane system incorporates several preventative actions that ensure a safe and leak free system.\n\n\n\nAll Silane handling is performed per written standard operating procedure by trained employees. The Silane system is not modified except through management of change process. Preventative maintenance is performed on the Silane system. Ready for Startup Review is performed after significant maintenance / alteration to system. Process hazards are identified and mitigation verified by process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\nA visual inspection of the Silane system is carried out prior to each use of the system. Silane leakage will leave a white or brownish type staining (silicon dioxide powder) on the system components when the Silane comes in contact with air. Following the visual inspection a leak check is performed with high-pressure helium to the working pressure of the system. A final system check is the vacuum leak check. In this test the system must hold a certain level of vacuum for a specified amount of time in order to be certified leak-free.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the transfer of Silane is taking place from the bulk source only the required amount of bulk Silane is valved open to the system, minimizing the amount of Silane that could potentially escape should a leak occur and reducing the amount of time an operator would need to isolate the bulk source of  Silane. The Silane operation is constantly monitored while the system is in use. At the end of each workday all sources of Silane are closed off and isolated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Silane filling is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This cross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill condition to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Silane system is constructed with a minimal amount of threaded connections and is welded wherever possible. All piping material is 316L stainless steel. All valves on the Silane system incorporate a double seal design and offer the highest leak free integrity. Emergency shutdown buttons are strategically placed and allow the operator to quickly stop the flow of product should an emergency situation arise.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greatest hazard of Silane is flammable potential. Silane is a pyrophoric gas that burns upon contact with air. Operators wear personal protective equipment including flame resistant clothing. The Silane filling system is in a Class 1, Division II room. Fire detection/suppression systems are in place at the fill system and bulk source. The bulk source is staged in an area surrounded on three sides with fire walls.\n\n",

The Hydrogen Chloride system is not modified except through management of change process. Preventative maintenance is performed on the Hydrogen Chloride system. Ready for Startup Review is performed after significant maintenance / alteration to system. Process hazards are identified and mitigation verified by process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a daily basis the operator performs a visual inspection of the Hydrogen Chloride system looking for any signs of leakage which would be indicated with signs of corrosion, discoloration of system parts, or fuming. As part of the standard operating procedure, the system is subjected to a pressure test with helium up to the working pressure of the system to verify the system is leak free prior to any introduction of Hydrogen Chloride into the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hydrogen Chloride bulk source is a tube trailer consisting of 6 tubes. During use, only one tube is allowed to be open at a time, restricting the amount of product in the system should a leak occur and reducing the amount of time an operator would need to close and isolate the bulk source of product.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hydrogen chloride is withdrawn from the tube trailer gas phase and not liquid phase, reducing the volume of product in the piping should a leak occur. At the end of each workday all tubes on the Hydrogen Chloride trailer are closed (isolated).\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen Chloride is a corrosive product. The entire fill system is constructed of 316L stainless and hastelloy components, offering resistance to hydrogen chloride corrosion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weight of hydrogen chloride for cylinders being filled is monitored as part of standard operating procedure using scales maintained under a calibration program. Weight monitoring minimizes the potential to have overfilled cylinders.",

The Chlorine system is not modified except through management of change process. Preventative maintenance is performed on the Chlorine system. Ready for Startup Review is performed after significant maintenance / alteration to system. Process hazards are identified and mitigation verified by process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chlorine system is given a daily visual inspection prior to use for the purpose of detecting any leaks. Chlorine leaks would be evident from signs of corrosion and/or discoloration of the system parts\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the standard operating procedure and prior to each pressurization with hazardous gas, the system is checked for leaks with helium. The system is verified leak free prior to the introduction of Chlorine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chlorine system is constructed of 316L stainless steel and hastelloy components to minimize any corrosion effects from chlorine.
