Introduction:\n\n\n\nThe  Royster-Clark  Nitrogen Niota terminal  is  an  ammonia\n\nterminal  that  unloads ammonia barges from the  Mississippi\n\nRiver into a storage tank.  The ammonia is then loaded  into\n\ntrucks   for  transportation  to  agricultural  distribution\n\ncenters.  The facility has been in operation since 1967.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen Company, Niota Terminal, has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto plant personnel or contractors since operations began in\n\n1967.\n\n\n\nB.   Accidental Release Prevention and Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Niota facility has an excellent\n\nsafety record with no deaths to plant personnel or\n\ncontractors since it was constructed in 1967.   In addition,\n\nthe plant has operated without a lost time accident for over\n\nthirty-two years.  There have been no RMP reportable\n\nreleases of toxic chemicals in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen facility in Niota has\n\nincorporated a safety vision that states, \"We, the employees\n\nof Royster-Clark Nitrogen, utilize teamwork, communication,\n\nand education, with the full support of management, to\n\nachieve safety excellence.\"   Royster-Clark Nitrogen\n\nemployees utilize this vision statement as a reminder of the\n\npriority of achieving safety excellence.  Employees are\n\nhighly involved in creating and implementing safety programs\n\nand safety systems at the facility, with a focus on\n\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the Safety Program include:\n\n\n\nu    Extensive employee participation in the development,\n\n  implementation, and review of safety systems and programs at\n\n  the facility.  All employees participate in an annual\n\n  evaluation of the safety programs at the facility.\n\n\n\nu    A well developed training program that ensures that\n\n  employees are knowledgeabl"

Examples of employee participation include\n\n  updating and compiling technical documents, networked\n\n  computers that provide all employees instant access to up to\n\n  date safety information, participation in Process Hazard\n\n  Analyses, and continual employee training.\n\n\n\n\n\nu    Royster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive program to\n\n  help ensure that hazards associated with the various\n\n  processes are identified and controlled.   Within this\n\n  system, each process is systematically examined to identify\n\n  hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\n\n  manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nu    Royster-Clark Nitrogen has well-established practices\n\n  and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems,\n\n  relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors,\n\n  and emergency shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nu    Training of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview\n\n  of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency\n\n  response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices.\n\n\n\nu    Royster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive system to\n\n  manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that\n\n  process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls\n\n  are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that\n\n  existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected\n\n  chemical hazard information, process operating limits,\n\n  equipment information, and procedures are updated to\n\n  incorporate these changes.
