PPG also trains distribution center employees in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling procedures, and fork truck-driving safety.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG?s overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is to ?market, distribute and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.?\n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled.\n\nPPG?s Albany Distribution Center (Albany DC) is a recent addition to PPG's Automotive Refinish Business Unit.  The Albany DC stores automotive refinish paint, primers, and related products and distributes them to both internal refinish distribution centers and external distributors (jobbers) throughout North America.  The Albany DC stores products in various size containers, including aerosol spray cans.  Some of the aerosols contain propane and butane, which are regulated subsuances and are used as propellants.   \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nThe Albany DC aerosol storage process is classified as a Program 1 process because the worst-case scenario has no off-site impact and because there were no accidental releases in the past 5 years that meet RMP criteria.  The facility has certified that no additional prevention steps are needed.\n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nThere have been no releases in the past 5 years that resulted in an on-site or off-site impact.\n\nEmergency response program.\n\nThe Albany DC coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are"
