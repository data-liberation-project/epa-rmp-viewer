This commitment is demonstrated by our dedication of staff and resources to our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and self-audits.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Wateree Water Treatment Plant is rated to treat up to 6 million gallons per day of potable water production.  The facility provides water to the cities of Lugoff and Elgin and other areas within the county. In order to provide water that is free of harmful bacteria and pathogens, chlorine, considered potentially toxic by the US EPA, is used as a disinfectant for the water.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations related to the safe handling of chlorine. \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine stored at the plant is larger than the threshold quantity for this chemical as listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  As a result, this RMP addresses chlorine at the Lake Wateree facility.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Wateree facility has had no major chlorine releases or accidents in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the South Carolina OSHA program.  The elements in the program include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audits, incident investigations, management of change, pre-startup reviews, contractors, employee participation, and hot work permits.  Addressing the requirements of each element provide the foundation of the LEWA Lake Wateree Water Treatment Plant's accidental release prevention program.  The program is integrated into the operation of the chlorination system by senior management and operations staff.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine containers are stored inside a building in a ded"

As part of the recently completed plant upgrade, a chlorine scrubber with associated equipment and ductwork was installed in 2003 to mitigate any consequences of a chlorine release.  The scrubber system is designed to capture and neutralize a chlorine release up to 2,000 pounds in quantity.  Additional chlorine leak detectors and automatic controls were added as part of the facility upgrade.\n\n\n\nLEWA has established a program to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas. The prevention plan, presented in the Risk Management Program, consists of procedures and training designed to prevent accidents, including:\n\no  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\n\no  Employee Training \n\no  Preventive Maintenance Program (Mechanical Integrity)\n\no  Accident Investigation and Documentation\n\no  Compliance Audits\n\no  Process Safety Information\n\no  Process Hazard Analysis\n\no  Management of Change\n\no  Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\no  Use of Contractors\n\no  Employee Participation\n\no  Hot Work Permits\n\n\n\nThe LEWA Lake Wateree Water Treatment Plant has an emergency response program in place to enable the facility to effectively respond to a chlorine release, minimize injuries, lessen the impact to the surrounding community, and provide guidance to emergency response personnel.  The operating staff is trained to respond to chlorine releases with established procedures on seeking outside assistance as needed, public notifications, etc.  The LEWA has coordinated an emergency response plan with the following agency:\n\n\n\nLugoff Fire Department\n\n892 Highway 1, South\n\nLugoff, SC 29078-9345\n\n803-438-2911\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"
