      "SummaryText": "The emergency response procedures are contained at the front of the Risk Management Plan Manual and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. \n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from various field wells.  High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL which is stored in two 48,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in one 42,000 gallon skim tank and two 16,800 barrel bulk atmospheric storage tanks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances. The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane. For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written prevention plan is not required. Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the Risk Management Plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
