      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nRRI Energy operates a coal-fired, electric power generating station in New Florence, Pennsylvania. This 1,750-acre facility, known as Conemaugh Station, is located 13 miles northwest of Johnstown, PA, between the Conemaugh River and Route 32008. \n\nConemaugh Station employs approximately 200 full-time staff and a considerable number of contract employees.  The secondary economic impact of the facility on its many material and services suppliers is significant.  For example, the station provides employment for an estimated 1200 coal miners and about 100 truck drivers.\n\nThe facility generates 1700 MW of power from two identical, 850 MW units. Each unit has a pollution control system, including electrostatic precipitators for particulate, wet limestone scrubbers for sulfur dioxides, and special burners to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nReliant Energy\u00bfs policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES \n\nThis facility is a coal-fired, electric power generating station.\n\nb. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES - Anhydrous ammonia is used at Conemaugh station as a flue gas conditioner.  The ammonia improves the ability of the electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) to remove particulate from the flue gas.  In this process, the ammonia is converted to ammonium sulfate and removed from the flue gas as particulate.  \n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials are stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\n\nc. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is transported, stored and conveyed as a liquid up to evaporators. A single 12,000-gallon tank located outdoors adjacent to the Unit No. 2 ESP is used to store the anhydrous ammonia liquid. The storage tank is kept under pressure"

      "FacilityID": 54425,
      "SummaryText": "to maintain the ammonia in liquid form. Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tank is not filled above the 85% level.\n\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\na. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario assumes that the ammonia storage tank catastrophically ruptures and the entire contents are released onto the pavement in 10 minutes.  The quantity released in the 10-minute event is calculated as:\n\n18,000 gallons * 85% * 5.17 lb/gal = 52,734 lb\n\nb. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes that the entire contents of a 6,300-gallon ammonia tank truck are spilled into the paved unloading area over a 10-minute period (due to, for example, an unloading hose rupture). The quantity released in the 10-minute event is calculated as:\n\n6,300 gallons * 5.17 lb/gal = 32,571 lb\n\nBecause both the ammonia tank truck and the ammonia storage tank have excess flow valves which would close upon the increase in flow from a hose rupture, this is a very unlikely scenario. However, the use of excess flow valves was not considered in the alternative release calculations.\n\nc. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT \n\nThe offsite consequences of these accidental releases were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*COMP, version 1.07).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include highly improbable weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, and the highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity observed over the previous three years. The more typical meteorological parameters used in analyzing the alternative release scenario include a mean wind speed of 9.1 mph and \"D\" atmospheric stability.\n\nThe maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*COMP model is 2.6 miles for the worst-case scenario.  This represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case weather conditions"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 2,
      "FacilityID": 54425,
      "SummaryText": ") could pose a hazard to the public.  For the alternative release scenario, the maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*COMP model is a more realistic 0.4 miles. \n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThere are many safety programs in place at Conemaugh station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\n\n- A comprehensive process safety management (PSM) program has been implemented for all ammonia process equipment.  This includes daily visual inspections, periodic mechanical integrity checks, and operator training.\n\n- The ammonia storage tank is a registered pressure vessel that is built to exacting standards.\n\n- Ammonia tank trucks are only unloaded during daylight hours on weekdays.\n\n- The ammonia storage tank is administratively controlled to 85% of its full capacity.\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nNo accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 have occurred during the past five years at this site.\n\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release of ammonia would occur, the station has prepared a detailed written emergency response plan.  This plan has been in place for many years, and yearly drills are held to test the plan under simulated conditions.\n\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nAll station safety programs, including the emergency response program, are reviewed periodically for improvement opportunities."
