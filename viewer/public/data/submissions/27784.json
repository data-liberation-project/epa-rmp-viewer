Overhill Farms, Inc.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOverhill Farms has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the Refrigeration System at its Vernon facility to enhance its already existing safety programs.  Overhill Farms is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  Overhill Farms staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The Refrigeration System, that contains the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, is used for freezer operation and chilling water.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOverhill Farms has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include a discussion of the overall approach elected by Overhill Farms for implementation at the facility, key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, threats and civil disorder, earthquake, potential imminent danger to personnel, chemical spill, and ammonia health hazards \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Refrigeration System at the Overhill Farms is a two-stage system comprised of compressors, evaporative condensers, a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, a glycol heater, two water chillers, an intercooler, a thermosyphon vessel, a recirculator, and an accumulator.  \n\nThe Refrigeration System at Overhill Farms provides the cooling medium for several spiral freezers, holding freezers, a 34?F Cooler, shipping and receiving docks, one glycol heater and two water chillers.  The Refrigeration System contains anhydrous ammonia that continuously circulates through the system."

      "SummaryText": "  Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the system provides the needed cooling effect.  \n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nWorst-Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: It is assumed that liquid ammonia is released from the largest vessel that is the High Pressure Receiver.  Per the instructions of the regulation, the release is postulated to occur in 10 minutes.  Since the vessel is located outside of a building, passive mitigation measures were not incorporated into the calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used as specified in the regulation.  The reference table included in EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm.  The result shows that offsite areas may be affected.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios were considered.  Scenario Description: ALT-1: A ? inch equivalent diameter opening on a liquid pipe, which is 10 feet above the ground, at 150-psig pressure and remains under pressure until the entire charge of the system is emptied.  ALT-2: Same as ALT-1 except that the equivalent diameter is ? inch.  This scenario models a leak from valve packing or a pipe connection.  However, the selected opening diameter is very conservative given the typical opening sizes experienced in similar situations.  The meteorological conditions specified in the regulation for alternative scenarios were used.  The reference table included in EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm.  The downwind distances for these scenarios are significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  However, in these cases also, offsite areas may be affected.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOverhill Farms has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to manage the safety aspects of the Refrigeration System.  In addition, comm"

      "SummaryText": "on industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by industry sources.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are ammonia detectors situated in all those compartments where ammonia is present.  \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Overhill Farms Refrigeration System is newly constructed.  Therefore, there have been no incidents where ammonia has been released to the atmosphere.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and management system improvements are being considered and implemented as a result of the technical studies done in the course of the development of the PSM and RMP Programs.  These improvements include a few instrumentation additions to the system, installation of vehicle barriers to protect equipment from vehicles, and several administrative changes that address specific practices and procedures regarding ammonia delivery, training and other tasks related to the operation of the Refrigeration System."
