      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \r\n \r\nPanther Creek Processing Facility owned and operated by Tall Oak Midstream, LLC is committed to the same brand of safety and environmental excellence that all other company assets promote. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. The facility is a Program Level 1 facility, since there are no public receptors within the worst case scenario distance. The facility does maintain their emergency action plan and communication with the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10. the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the Panther Creek Gas Plant (one process) is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor. Within the past five years, the Panther Creek Gas Plant has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(g)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignature - _________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTitle - _____President, C3 Resources________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nDate Signed - ___3/5/2022___________________________________________________"
