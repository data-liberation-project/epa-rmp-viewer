Health, safety and enviornmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrour ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the enviornment and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at this facility ( the stationary source) is the storage, handling and care of fertilizers and outher agricultural products.  Anhydrous ammonia, which is used for manufacturing 10-34-0 fertilizer, is also received and stored at the facility.  The Maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 320,000 pounds stored in two (2) 34,200 gallon rail tank cars or truck trailer. The maximum fill level of each real car or trailer is 85% of the total tank capacity.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when both rail tanks cars or trailers are located ath the facility are at the maximum fill level of 85%.\n\n\n\nApproximately once or twice each year 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, superphosporic acid and water in a converter reactor.

The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia release would be approximately 160,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentratiuon extends off site and public receptors are within the disatance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration         (0.14 mg/L) is 2.82 miles. There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                     The alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the rail car.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of apporximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic end point concentration (0.14mg/L) is 1.18 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the release prevention program elements for he liquid fertilizer manufactureing process. \n\n\n\n1) Process Safety Information:  The process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.

The process hazard analysis reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause and accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor relaeases.  The results of the process hazard analysis reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n3) Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures for the process are readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  The operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary so that they reflect current practices and changes to the process or equipment. \n\n\n\n 4) Training: All operatiors of the process equipment participate in a training program.  Initial training consists of classroom type instruction that covers health and safety hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n                                                         \n\n 5)  Mechanical Integrity:  A written mechanical integrity program is used to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, and be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA).                                                                                                                                                                    \n\nPlanning Changes to improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures"
