Box 106, Hornick, Iowa 51026\nFor Locations at:\nBlencoe, Correctionville, Hornick, Mapleton, Pierson, Turin, Washta,\n\nExecute Summary\n\n1. Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in heating and grain drying.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) varies by location:\n\n            Tank Size (gallons)    Pounds\n              100 %                          85 %\nBlencoe, IA        30,000            131,325        \n    Nurse Tanks      42 @ 1,000        183,855    \n    Total        72,000            315,180                        \n        \nCorrectionville, IA     25,000            109,438        \n    Nurse Tanks  21 @ 1,000              91,927\n    Total        46,000            201,365\n    \nHornick, IA        11,000             48,152\n            30,000             131,325\n          8,000              35,020\n    Nurse Tanks  42 @ 1,000            183,855        \n    Total        91,000            398,352\n\nPierson, IA        12,000             52,530\n            30,000            131,325\n    Nurse Tanks     21 @ 1,000              91,927\n    Total        63,000            275,782        \n\nWashta        18,000             78,795\n            12,000                   52,530\n            12,000             52,530    \n    Nurse Tanks  24 @ 1, 000        105,060            Total        66,000            288,915\n    \nMapleton, IA    12,000             52,530\n            12,000             52,530\n    Nurse Tanks  37 @ 1,000            161,967\n    Total             61,000            267,027\n    \n    Turin, IA        12,000             52,530\n                12,000              52,530\n        Nurse Tanks     29 @ 1,000            126,947                Total        53,000            232,007    \n    \n3.

      "SummaryText": "lternative Release Scenario.  \na. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 109,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of 200 PPM) is .9 miles at the location with the largest storage.\n\nb.     The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint for anhydrous ammonia (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n    \nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous \nAmmonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\n5.        The Five Year Accident History\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has had one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n- 12-24-98: At the Blencoe Location:  118,450 pounds were released; the town of Blencoe was evacuated. This incident occurred when a railroad car derailed, hitting the anhydrous ammonia tank, shearing off the piping, including the excess flow valve.  No deaths, injuries, environmental damage or property damage occurred, except to our storage tank and the railroad car.\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program.    \n\n        Western Iowa Coop has:\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and Community Right to Know information as required under SARA Title II (EPCRA).\n\nc.
