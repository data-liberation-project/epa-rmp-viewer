Renosol Seating endeavors in all its activities to promote a better environment. Renosol Seating recognizes that our activities have impacts on our employees and the surrounding community. It is our desire to reduce adverse impacts of our business by:\n\n- continually reviewing daily activities and practices relative to their effect on health, safety and the environment; and \n- taking measures to prevent pollution and injury, conserve resources, minimize waste, improve working conditions and comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations and other requirements.                                                                                   \n- we will seek new methods to balance the constant need for development with a commitment to protecting the environment by continuous improvement.\n- we will work and communicate with customers, governments, local communities, employees, and suppliers to identify and resolve environmental issues. \n\nRenosol Seating is a member of the Suppliers Partnership for the Environment, a trade association comprised of automotive and vehicle suppliers who work in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.)\n\nRenosol Seating of Farwell, Michigan, manufacturing plant has been registered to ISO-14001:1996, the worldwide environmental management system standard. While Renosol Seating has always taken care to ensure compliance to environmental standards and to protect the health and safety of its employees, ISO-14001 provides important guidelines for continuing to examine and improve its environmental management systems.

      "SummaryText": "strations, Ltd., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSF International. It is accredited by the Registrar Accreditation Board (RAB) and the Dutch Council for Accreditation (RvA.).\n\nThrough these and other initiatives, Renosol Seating has implemented a system that holds each employee accountable for the safety and environmental performance of the company.\n\nThe Renosol Seating facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\nThe Farwell, Michigan facility produces liquid polyurethane systems and polyurethane seating, headrest, armrest and console cushions for the automotive industry.  Two types of foam lines are utilized at the facility \u00bf an MDI line (Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate) and a TDI (Toluene diisocyanate) line.  The other major chemical component to the product is polyol.  The maximum storage capacity for polyol storage to include raw polyol and formulated polyols for the entire facility is estimated at 183,250 gallons; 5,400 gallons for MDI, and 28,600 gallons of TDI.  \n\nOnly the TDI process is subject to the RMP requirement.  The TDI is transferred into three indoor storage tanks from railcars.  From the indoor storage tanks, TDI is transferred via hard plumbed lines to smaller retaining tanks for daily use.  \n\nThe TDI foaming line consists of 1 - thirty station race track design line and 2 - twelve station carousel lines with each station containing either a multiple of bend or bucket seat molds.  One of the carousel lines usesa soy product material with TDI instead of the polyol.  The general process consists of the first station, the foam (mixture of TDI and polyol) is mechanically poured into the mold.  The lid to the mold is then immediately closed and clamped shut.  The foam is cured as it rotates through the various stations.  The lid is then opened and the foam seat is removed.  The mold is vacuumed clean and a wax release agent is applied to the mold so that it can be used again.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific"

      "SummaryText": "prevention steps:\n\nThe Renosol Seating Farwell Plant complies with a variety of environmental and safety programs including waste management, air emissions controls, storm water pollution prevention, spill prevention, community right-to-know programs (EPCRA), hazardous materials management, emergency response and many others.  Renosol Seating, LLC has exceeded minimum efforts to comply with these requirements by implementing an ISO 14000 Environmental Management System.  Central to these efforts is a consistent effort to prevent incidents and accidents, including chemical spills.  \n\nOver the years, Renosol Seating has invested in equipment, employee training programs, procedural improvements and made various facility improvements to support these prevention efforts.  With respect to prevention of chemical-related incidents, Renosol Seating has made several investments.  Renosol Seating constructed containment systems to contain any spills including containment systems that are integrated into railways serving the facility.  These containment systems include concrete and pavement in outdoor chemical delivery and unloading areas, a spill containment pan integrated into the rail line serving the facility.  The TDI is stored indoors within a concrete containment system constructed in an integral fashion with the building.  Strict procedures are also followed when materials are unloaded including the requirement that a person observes the unloading of the entire freight car.  \n\nFixed air monitoring equipment is installed within the building to provide an early warning of any TDI release.  These monitors are inspected and tested on a regular basis to ensure their accuracy and functioning ability.  The principle of detection is based on a chemical reaction caused by the presence of TDI on a chemically impregnated paper tape. A sample of plant air is drawn through the tape by a pump. When TDI is present in the sample, it causes a stain to form on the paper tape. The intens"

      "SummaryText": "ity of the stain is proportional to the concentration of TDI in the sample. A photo diode monitors the stain intensity as a chemical reaction occurs on the paper.  If the intensity of the stain is above a pre-set level, the alarm relays are initiated and an indication is shown on the LCD display.  The display shows flashing bells to indicate that the instrument is in alarm mode.  The alarm condition persists until a reading below the alarm set point is reached. No employee is allowed back into the area until a reading of below the set alarm is reached (5 ppb is the alarm level). \n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nThere has been one incident involving TDI in the last five years.  A minimal amount of TDI was released when a hose line on the foaming process ruptured.  One employee complained of exposure but was not injured.  No offsite impacts resulted from the release.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nRenosol Seating has made a significant effort to communicate the elements of its response program with local emergency responders.  Members of the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Commission have visited the facility.  The facility\u00bfs Environmental Health & Safety Specialist is currently scheduled to obtain the 40-hour HAZWOPER training, among other emergency response training updates and requirements.  Facility personnel involved with the TDI process receive regular training on pollution prevention and emergency response.  This training includes participating in an emergency drill which is documented.   Alert systems are also in place at the facility.  As previously described the facility is equipped with TDI air monitoring devices to provide early warning of a TDI release.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nRenosol Seating continues to review its programs and procedures and make improvements where necessary.  At this time, no significant improvement needs have been identified."
