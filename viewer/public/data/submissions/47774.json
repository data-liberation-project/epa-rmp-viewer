Town Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant is located in Lexington, Kentucky, 301 Lisle Industrial Avenue and is operated by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government - Division of Sanitary Sewers. The primary function of this facility is the treatment of wastewater, in doing so chlorine is used for disinfection purposes and sulfur dioxide is for the neutralization of chlorine in plant effluent.  The probability of a release at this facility is classified as low to medium.  The chlorine storage building with a full scrubbing facility should prevent any major release from leaving the area.  Should a leak of a chlorine cylinder or sulfur dioxide cylinder occur, the onsite personnel (LFUCG employees) and surrounding population would be immediately vulnerable to exposure.  In the event of a release, there may be possible human health impacts to on-site employees.  A residential area to the North as well as property and the environment would be affected.  Contamination near the facility is possible.  A worse case release could affect an area over 2.0 mile radius and impact a sizeable residential and institutional population.  The Lexington Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) Division of Sanitary Sewers has invested ample and considerable time in devising and implementing accidental release prevention programs and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nTown Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant applies a holistic and proactive approach towards risk management.  The LFUCG has devised a reliable maintenance program, identifying management policies, preventive maintenance practices, plans, and procedures to identify and minimize risk at the plant.  Preventive maintenance consists of daily and weekly "

A data sheet is printed out daily indicating the maintenance and check schedule of all equipment and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe LFUCG manages risk proactively by reduction and avoidance.  To date no accidents or leaks have occurred at the Town Branch facility.  Management and employees of the LFUCG reduce risk by conducting manual inspections and routine maintenance checks.  The LFUCG identifies, evaluates, and analyzes potential risk situations in order to minimize a potential hazardous event at the plant.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak would occur, LFUCG employees, and the LFUCG Fire Department are well prepared and trained to remediate and or mitigate the situation.  LFUCG employees are trained in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  They are also trained on initial startup procedures, normal operating procedures, temporary operating procedures, emergency operating procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, normal shutdown procedures, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary    cont:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances at the Town Branch facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Worst case and alternative release scenarios were developed for both of these regulated chemicals in order to determine the impact it would have on the immediate community.  The risk analysis for both was modeled with EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The results for this modeling is described below; however, it should be noted that the likelihood of leaks of this size and nature occurring are absolute worst scenarios and are not likely to occur.  The Town Branch WWTP has invested millions of dollars to ensure the proper precautionary systems and equipment was installed to protect against leaks of a worst-case magnitude.  These precautionary measures are best exemplified in the alternative release sc"

The EPA defines a worst-case release as the following:\n\n\n\n* The release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure, and\n\n\n\n* The release that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint for the regulated toxic substance.\n\n\n\nOnly passive mitigation measures were considered for the off-site consequence analysis for both scenarios (No active mitigation measures were considered).  The only passive mitigation at Town Branch applicable for these scenarios was enclosure of the toxic gases in the building.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine at any given time is no more then 20 tons and no more then 8 tons for sulfur dioxide. The largest quantity of both chemicals were determined by taking into account administrative controls rather than absolute capacity of the pipes.  Town Branch uses administrative controls that limit the quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that can be stored in a pipe at any one time.\n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case release for chlorine via a pipe leak at Town Branch, using only passive mitigation measures is 8,000 lbs with a release rate of 440 lbs/min.  The duration of the release is 10 minutes with wind speed calculated at 1.5 m/sec.  Considering these factors, the maximum effected radius or distance to the endpoint is calculated at 2 miles (based on EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables for Chlorine Gas).  Within this 2-mile radius, approximately 66,000 people could potentially be affected.  Residences, schools, hospitals, and recreation areas are all within this specified area and could potentially be affected.\n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case release for anhydrous sulfur dioxide via a pipe leak, using passive mitigation measures is 4,000 lbs with a release rate of 220 lbs/min.

If a chlorine leak does occur it will be detected by leak detectors in the chlorine room or in the pump room.  In the event of a chlorine leak in the feed room, or the tank storage room, the following systems would be activated.  If a leak detector detects chlorine gas, the ventilation systems and the alarm systems will be activated.    The alarm system consists of both an audible and a visual alarm in the building.  There will also be a visual alarm and audible alarm outside the building.  An alarm is also on the main computer systems, so if an operator is in the computer room he will see and hear the alarm.  When the leak detectors are activated, they will cause the ventilation systems to shut down.  Following the shut down of the ventilation system, the scrubber system is immediately automatically activated.  This system will remove the contaminated air from the feed or storage room via intake piping.  Chlorine gas will settle to the lower portions of the room, where the air intake piping is located, allowing it to be picked up and pulled into the caustic tank room where it is passed through the caustic solution.  This solution neutralizes the chlorine gas that is in the air and returns the scrubbed air back into the chlorine tank storage room and feed room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary    cont:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ventilation systems, which are associated with the chlorine tank storage room, are checked every 30 days for operational condition.

The seals and all controls associated with this pump are checked to make sure they are operable.  Upon verification of the three units, ventilation, leak detectors, and scrubber, the system is then activated to verify operation.\n\n\n\nAlternative systems are in tact if failure of engineering or administrative controls were to occur.  In the event of a failure of the ventilation system, should there be a leak in the feed room or tank room, the caustic scrubber would still be activated automatically.  Upon investigation of these units, if it is found that the ventilators failed to shut down, the ability to manually override them and to manually shut them down by turning off the power in the motor control center room is available.\n\n\n\nIn the event that there is a malfunctioning leak detector, a number of things could occur.  If a leak detector has a weak cell or a bad battery, these two scenarios will activate the alarm system.  Upon investigating the alarm, the operator can determine whether it is a true leak or a malfunction of the system using a portable gas monitor.  If it is determined that the leak detector has malfunctioned, the system does have the ability to lock that particular unit out of the sequence.  This does not disarm the other five units that are in place.  The likelihood of having all six malfunction is remote.\n\n\n\nIf for some reason, the caustic scrubber pump would not run automatically, there is a manual override available to kick the pump on.
