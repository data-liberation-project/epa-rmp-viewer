The plant uses chlorine to disinfect the water. Treated water is then distributed citywide for use in homes, industry, and for fire fighting purposes.\r\n\r\nThe raw water is treated through the use of alum flocculation process and disinfected with chlorine. In the disinfection process, a chjlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution. The treated water is mixed with the chlorine solution in a contact chamber, killing pathogens that are dangerous to humans, animals, and aquatic life after flocculation treatment.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR 68, and therefore any process utilizing more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. The City of Cherryville stores up to a maximum of three (3) one-ton cylinders (approximately 6,000 pounds) of chlorine and is therefore subject to RMP requirements. The storage of chlorine also makes this facility subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.\r\n\r\nThe worse case toxic chemical release scenario is a release from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten (10) minutes. The alternate toxic chemical release scenario is a slower release approximated as a one-quarter inch hole, twelve inches below the liquid level of the cylinder. This would involve the release of about 1,000 pounds over a slightly longer period of time. These releases could affect local populations. \r\n\r\nTo prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard. All tenets of the Process Safety Management program are included by reference into this RMP.\r\n\r\nAspects of the release prevention program include operating procedures, inspections of equipment, employee training, automatic shutoff equipment, and a chlorine gas detection monitor and alarm.

In the event of a chlorine accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify the LEPC and evacuate the facility. Trained LEPC staff will evaluate the situation and make further decisions.\r\n\r\nAgain, the City of Cherryville is committed to operating all of its facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Compliance with these regulations is only a portion of the city's commitment."
