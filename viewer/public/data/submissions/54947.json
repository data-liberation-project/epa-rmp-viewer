Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nRoy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations of the Clean Air Act in June 1999. Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland staff is highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \nRoy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland is located at 1785 East Beamer St., Woodland, California in the county of Yolo. The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 11,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 51,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 30,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 390,000 pounds. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aq"

Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \n\n-Risk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\nAutomatic/Manual Shutdown\n   -Well designed Relief System.\n   -The history of the Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Roy Riegals Chemical"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe facility?s maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 51,000 lbs.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM.  The 500 lbs state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program is also exceeded.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 and EPA RMP Program Level 3. \n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n   -Process Safety Information\n   -Process Hazard Analysis\n   -Operating Procedures\n   -Training\n   -Mechanical Integrity\n   -Management of Change\n   -Pre-Startup Safety Review\n   -Compliance Audits\n   -Incident Investigation\n   -Employee Participation\n   -Hot Work Permit\n   -Contractors\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan. See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\n\nThe facility?s charge of aqueous ammonia is 92,000 lbs.  Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lbs threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Roy Riegals Chemical Co., - Woodland is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 24% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantity of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%. For the reasons mentioned above, the Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and EPA RMP Program Level 2.\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Prevention Program 2 elements include:\n\n   -Safety Informaion\n   -Hazard Review\n   -Operating Procedures\n   -Training\n   -Maintenance\n   -Compliance Audits\n "

General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia were addressed.  The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact. \n\n-The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required.
