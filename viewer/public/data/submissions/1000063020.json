This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our facility adheres to federal and state regulations, industry standards and practices, internal process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of company and industry experience. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe Yorktown terminal is located at 2201 Goodwin Neck Road, Yorktown, VA, 23692. The terminal is owned by Plains Marketing, L.P. The terminal has 2 processes that contain materials above the threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the RMP rule.  All covered processes contain regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The flammable mixtures typically contain primarily propane and butane. The processes are propane and butane storage and propane and butane rail operations.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n \n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario \n\nThe Yorktown terminal has performed worst case scenario (WCS) analyses as required by the rule, and has shared this information with local emergency responders as well as the surrounding communities. \n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario \n\nThe alternative release scenario for the terminal is a rupture of a loading hose while loading a butane railcar. Under this scenario, the release is isolated within 10 minutes. The maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint"

Because processes at the terminal that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n\n \n\nEmployee Participation\n\n \n\nThe Yorktown terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the terminal accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the terminal. \n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n \n\nThe terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the terminal has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table.

In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\n \n\nThe terminal also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n \n\nThe terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and tracked. Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures \n\n\n\nThe terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process (when necessary). These procedures are developed by experienced operators or supervisors and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them in accordance with the management of change process. \n\nIn addition, the terminal maintains Safe Operating Limit Tables that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining \n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n \n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce at varying staffing levels depending on maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform terminal personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) \n\n\n\nThe terminal conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
