Huestess Waste Water Treatment Plant is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures through various training, safety, emergency and accidental release prevention programs, and overall process safety management.  The City is responsible for the training of all employees at the waste water treatment plant.  All new employees are provided training in the following topics, at a minimum:  the requirements of Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, chemicals used in the plant, how to read and get information from MSDS's, process hazards, use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedures, understanding process safety management, and the location of MSDS's, PSMP, and other safety information.  In addition to initial training, employees are trained on various topics related to the facility and its processes once every two weeks.\n     The E.H. Huestess Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located in southeast Cayce, adjacent to the Congaree River.  The plant currently has a daily process capacity of 9.5 million gallons per day.  The following processes provide both primary and secondary treatment and disinfection:  bar screens and grit removal system, activated sludge, disinfection using chlorine, dechlorination using sulfur dioxide, pH adjustment using sodium hydroxide if needed at the headworks, and at Pump Station #1 about 3/4's of a mile upstream of the wastewater treatment plant also located adjacent to the Congaree river, the use of Magnesium Hydroxide. Aerobic sludge digestion, and sludge thickening using belt press and drying beds.  The following substances (and the maximum quantity stored of each) are used in the treatment processes:  chlorine (6000 lbs), sulfur dioxide (4000 lbs), sodium hydroxide (8000 gal. at 25% solution), Magnesium Hydroxide (5500 gal. at 59% solution) and Clarifloc SE 506 Polymer (1000 gal.).Hydrated Lime (2500 lbs.)  Of these substances, only chlorine is held above EPA's threshold level, which"

Personnel safety measures and emergency health care responsibilities are also outlined in this plan.  Training which includes drills for practice in the event of an emergency release is provided at the time a new employee is hired and is also provided in refresher training courses which are provided at least every three years to current employees.  Additional safety training is provided every week on a variety of topics related to processes specific to the plant."
