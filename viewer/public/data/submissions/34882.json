The computer system can be controlled from off-site also.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe engineers have been trained to follow the PSM program guidelines established for this facility. Employees participate in regular safety meetings, safety inspections, and annual training classes on ammonia safety.\r\n\r\nA preventative maintenance program and facility check lists provide routine inspection of the refrigeration system. An annual inspection following the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IIAR) guidelines is performed on the equipment.

The program in place covers all aspects of OSHA's CFR 1910.\r\n\r\nCCS has a program for employees covering lockout tag-out and Personnel Protective Clothing (PPE), PPE testing emergency response training, and confined space training. Yearly inspections are performed on all aspects of the process.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nCCS is a refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerant. It is located on Highway 87 North, Tar Heel, NC 28392. The warehouse, which was built in 1992, is a 179,000 square foot facility designed to freeze and store frozen commodities. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two stage recirculated system. It utilizes a roof top evaporative condenser.\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is the high-pressure receiver, which can hold up to 10741 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. If this vessel was damaged and all 10741 pounds released over a 10 minute period (the required assumption by the Risk Management Program parameters), 200 PPM could reach 1.80 miles from the release point as calculated by the OCA Guidance Analysis. The liquid is contained in the Machine Room. There is no passive mitig"
