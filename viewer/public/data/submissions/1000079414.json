The RMP was prepared in compliance with both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  This resubmittal includes an updated narrative description (in this Executive Summary) of the AES Redondo Beach aqueous ammonia accident prevention program, the data elements required by the most recent USEPA RMP regulations, and represents a thorough review of operating and maintenance procedures, and a review of the process hazard analyses previously conducted.     \r\n\r\nAs documented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis prepared for the 2001 RMP revision, the additional SCR system installed for Unit 5 & 6 did not result in an increase of the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) impact distance for ammonia, the hazardous substance of concern, from the original June 1999 RMP. The OCA has been reviewed and confirmed for the 2004, 2009, 2014 and this 2019 resubmittal  Therefore, in accordance with USEPA regulations at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, at 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4), an RMP update filing with the USEPA was not required since the OCA impact distance did not change by more than a factor of two. The California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.10 also does not require a filing of an updated RMP under the CalARP Program if the OCA impact distance does not change by more than a factor of two unless the proces"

The 2001 RMP was not filed with the USEPA since an update was determined not to be required under federal regulations. The 2004, 2009 and 2014 resubmittals were submitted to the Redondo Beach Fire Department and USEPA. In 2016/2017, authority/responsibility for the CalARP program was transferred from the Redondo Beach Fire Department to the Los Angeles Fire Department Health Hazardous Materials Division.  \r\n\r\nAs before, for this 2019 RMP resubmittal, AES Redondo Beach LLC is preparing and resubmitting the RMP as a single integrated program document which includes both SCR deNOx systems, and is intended to reset the 5-year resubmittal period to run through the expected December 2020 facility closure. Due to the construction of new power plants in Long Beach and Huntington Beach, the AES Redondo Beach facility will cease operations by December 2020 and will undergo demolition following that.      \r\n\r\nThe 2019 RMP resubmittal process included the following and no changes to the system have occurred since before the previous resubmittal:\r\n\r\n1.\tAs an inherent part of the June 2016 and May 2019 Triennial RMP Compliance Audits, the SCR systems and programs were reviewed in summary by an experienced multi-disciplinary team of AES Redondo Beach personnel (operations, environmental, engineering and maintenance), facilitated by a HazOp-experienced ESCI EnviroServices, Inc. licensed Professional Engineer (who completed the Audit).

The AES Redondo Beach, LLC facility is located in the northwestern corner of the City of Redondo Beach, California.  SCE retained the electrical transmission facilities (e.g. the switchyards and power distribution lines).\r\n\r\nThe AES Redondo Beach, LLC power generating facility burns natural gas in boilers to produce steam. The steam is used in turbine generators to produce electricity. Currently, the station actively operates four primary boiler/steam turbine generating units, designated Units 5, 6, 7, and 8. Units 5 and 6 are operated from a common control room and are rated at 175 megawatts (MW) each.  Units 7 & 8 are operated from a common control room and are rated at 480 MW each.  \r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, due to the construction of new power plants in Long Beach and Huntington Beach, the AES Redondo Beach facility will cease operations by December 2020 and will undergo demolition following that.      \r\n\r\nThe basic flow path of each boiler is as follows:  (1) combustion air is supplied by fans to the air preheater where it is heated, (2) the heated air is mixed wi"

The amount of NOx that the station is allowed to emit is regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).  In 1991 - 1992, the SCAQMD revised its Rule 1135 which reduced the allowed NOx emissions and specifically required that SCE (the previous owner of the generating station) install a NOx emission reduction system on the two largest boilers - Units 7 and 8.  In 1993 - 1994, SCE installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx Control System on Units 7 and 8, which are operated from a common control room.  Identical SCR systems were designed and installed by the same firm, Noell, Inc., at several Southern California SCE generating stations.   \r\n\r\nIn December 2001, AES completed installation of an additional SCR system within the existing boilers of Units 5 and 6 to further reduce NOx emissions from the AES Redondo Beach, LLC facility.  This installation included one new 20,000-gallon double-walled aboveground aqueous ammonia storage tank and associated metering pumps and SCR catalyst grids."

      "SummaryText": "The SCR process involves injecting aqueous ammonia into the boiler flue gas in the boiler's convective pass. The ammonia/flue gas mixture flows through a catalyst installed between the convective pass and the air preheater.  In the presence of the catalyst, the ammonia and NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor, which exits out the boiler stack.  About 90% of the NOx is removed in this manner. The SCR system uses a 29.4% aqueous ammonia solution in the SCR system. The aqueous ammonia for Units 7 and 8 is stored in a 20,000-gallon double-walled underground storage tank; the aqueous ammonia for Units 5 and 6 is stored in one aboveground, double-walled tank with a containment berm.  Both installations feature a bermed tank loading area which is connected to a subsurface emergency containment sump.  Aqueous ammonia is one of several hazardous materials used at the facility that are critical to the safe and continued generation of electricity for the community.  As AES Redondo Beach utilizes aqueous ammonia over the federal 10,000-pound RMP threshold, the facility and the SCR process are covered under the federal and state Risk Management Prevention program. \r\n\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE:  WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nSeveral potential release scenarios were evaluated as part of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA).

The underground containment pipe is compression fitting 4\" PVC schedule 80.  Power Piping Code ANSI B31.1 recommends piping hanger spans of 8 1/2 feet for 1 1/2\" diameter pipe  (water service) at 1g-loads. The corresponding maximum weight stress level from Table 121.5 of the ANSI B31.1 Code, 1989 edition, is 2300 psi. Since the seismic g-load for the subject area is .3g in any horizontal direction, the combined load is only .42g in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the allowable seismic span is estimated to be 200 feet (using (1.0g/0.42g) x 8.5 feet = 20 feet). The seismic span for the aqueous ammonia piping is less than 10 feet in every case. In addition, the pressure stress is negligible since the maximum aqueous ammonia pressure is only 90 psi.

These procedures generally include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tUnit start up (boiler and flue gas blower) and operation;\r\n\u00bf\tSCR system normal start-up, normal shut down and emergency shutdown;\r\n\u00bf\tSCR system on-line operational procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tAqueous ammonia ordering and truck unloading procedure.\r\n\r\nOther AES Redondo Beach procedures potentially impact the operation of the SCR system and storage tanks, but are not directly related to SCR system or tank operations. These include general safety and fire protection policies, procedures and practices. The SCR system's general operation and maintenance is governed by these policies and practices where they apply.\r\n\r\nThese operational procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to assure they are current and accurate.  The last informal review was conducted as part of the RMP Triennial Compliance Audit in May 2019 and the 2018 PHA.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by annotating/revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through a formal management of change process.  The facility maintains several master sets of operational and maintenance procedures including a set in the relevant control room.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, AES Redondo"

      "SummaryText": "Beach has implemented a training program for all employees and contractors involved in operating or maintaining the SCR systems.  As an integral part of the safety and hazardous materials training, training which includes the safe receiving, operation and maintenance of the SCR system and associated tanks is provided to all personnel who are or may be working with the SCR system and/or aqueous ammonia.  This training is accomplished utilizing resources available inside and outside the station.  In general, new employees receive basic training in plant operations if they not already familiar with such operations and all new workers working with the SCR system or associated tanks are trained in the SCR system operating procedures as well as the specific hazards of ammonia.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. The most recent RMP-related training was conducted 9/4/2018.\r\n\r\nThe specific individual training programs at AES Redondo Beach is supported by the facility's Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and written safety procedures manual, which emphasizes communication of safety hazards and requirements on a continuous basis, as well as general safety and safe work practices training.  As noted elsewhere in the RMP, hazardous materials emergency response training is also provided.  Training documentation is maintained by the facility.  \r\n\r\nThe SCR system and other safety training at AES Redondo Beach may be performed in various formats and environments including classroom, field-based, on-the-job, safety meeting, team meeting and informal 'one-off' type interactions.  In addition, the facility's current aqueous ammonia vendor implements its own training program f"

At AES Redondo Beach, the ammonia vendor also has participated in the facility's on-site training related to ammonia handling.  The local fire department, Redondo Beach Fire Department, has also participated in on-site ammonia training.\r\n\r\nInitial SCR system operational and maintenance training was conducted for all station operations, maintenance and engineering personnel at the time each SCR system was constructed/installed as an integral part of each system's initial system start up and performance evaluation.  The training was conducted/supervised by the SCR system manufacturer/design company.  The training was both formal classroom-based and field-based.  A separate RMP program implementation training class was conducted in 1999 detailing the management and compliance requirements and responsibilities of the RMP/CalARP program.  Annual multi-media environmental training includes a module for management and compliance requirements and responsibilities of the RMP/CalARP program. The most recent RMP-related training was conducted 9/4/2018.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures and hazards to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted as an integral part of the AES Redondo Beach ongoing safety training program, but is assured met at least every 3 years.  At AES Redondo Beach, periodic refresher training has included the hazards of ammonia, ammonia truck delivery, loading and emergency procedures, off site consequences, general emergency response, and SCR system maintenance.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, and (4) correcting identified deficiencies.  In combination, these activities form a process that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Equipment-specific maintenance requirements and specifications for the SCR systems and storage tanks are contained in the multi-volume set of SCR System Operating and Maintenance Manuals provided by the two SCR system designers, NOELL and Mitsubishi.  Facility maintenance personnel use these manuals and the procedures contained therein as the primary references whenever performing SCR and storage tank inspection, maintenance, test and necessary repair/replacement.  These maintenance/operational procedures are maintained readily available to relevant personnel at the AES Redondo Beach facility.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel have received initial formal classroom training prior to initial SCR system startup as discussed in 'Training'.  SCR system equipment was incorporated into the AES Redondo Beach existing Preventive Maintenance Program.  The facility tracks and documents all manufacturer and regulatory-required maintenance and inspection activities, including a tickle file system for the Preventive Maintenance Program, on AES's computerized maintenance tracking system.

During any related or adjacent maintenance activities (whether or not on the SCR system and tanks), any damage observed during these activities is repaired/replaced as appropriate.\r\n\r\nDesignated facility personnel perform daily housekeeping inspections, which specifically include the SCR system and tanks. As part of the facility's Clean Water Act/Hazardous Waste (RCRA) compliance program, all equipment is visually inspected by designated facility personnel a minimum of twice each shift, with the results documented at least weekly on the inspection report.  Any damage or malfunction noted is reported and appropriately corrected.  Safety equipment associated with the ammonia systems (eye wash/shower, respirator protection, etc.) is also routinely inspected as part of the facility's ongoing existing occupational safety programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, AES Redondo Beach periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the risk management and accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  This audit reviews each of the USEPA-required prevention program elements to ensure that they are up-to-date and are being implemented and will help identify problem areas and if necessary take corrective actions.  Compliance audits are conducted by a team lead by AES compliance personnel assisted by an outside RMP compliance auditing consultant.

Should an RMP-reportable accident occur in the future, AES Redondo Beach will revise the RMP to include information about the accident within six months of the accident's occurrence, and revise the incident investigation information in the RMP.  Specifically, AES Redondo Beach will revise (1) the date of investigation to reflect the date of the investigation of the accident being included in the five year history; and (2) the expected date of completion of any changes due to that accident investigation, and submit a corrected RMP within six months of the date of the accident.  As stated previously, there have been no accidents meeting this threshold since SCRs have been in use at AES Redondo Beach.  There have been no recordable accidents of any kind involving the SCR system."
