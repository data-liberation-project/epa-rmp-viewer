(Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures.\n\nIts committment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n\"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the\n\nenvironment.\"\n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nRinchem Company Inc., Salt Lake City stores chemicals for the semiconductor industry. There are only four substances regulated under 40 CFR part 68 - Aqueous Ammonia Solution, Chlorine, Acetylene and Ethyl Mercaptan  - that is stored above the threshold quantity at this facility. These materials are not involved in any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed containers and cylinders. Rinchem is located in an industrial part of town with a mixed residential/commercial population nearby. The Warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials. There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as secondary containment at the docks and dikes in the rooms where the materials are stored. The liqud chemicals in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations. Toxic gases at the facility are stored in a secured, monitored gas pad with toxic gas detection capabilities. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state\n\nregulations, (2) engineering controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n\nThe areas of compliance include:\n\n- having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n\n- on"

It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the\n\nsupervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians. Training is an essential\n\nelement of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most\n\naccidents. The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for\n\nall new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors\n\nwho perform the tasks at the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving aqueous ammonia, chlorine, acetylene, or ethyl mercaptan  at this facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nRinchem has a emergency action plan. The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public. The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. Our employees are trained in the action plan to evacuate and call the appropriate responding agency to clean or stop the release. The facility does annual drills to insure employees understand what needs to be done in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our\n\nfacilities. Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventative measures are\n\nadequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe. However, we are"
