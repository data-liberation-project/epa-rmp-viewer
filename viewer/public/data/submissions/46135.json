As such, Aurora Cooperative has developed policies and procedures for the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia as well as response to potential releases. These include:\r\n1. A commitment to meet regulatory requirements related to the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n2. Training programs for all employees involved with handling anhydrous ammonia.\r\n3. Regular and thorough preventative maintenance of fixed and portable anhydrous ammonia equipment to assure compliance with regulations as well as to identify and correct potential defects.\r\n4. The training and equipping of key operations personnel to take aggressive emergency response actions using proper personal protective equipment in accordance with 29CFR1910.120(q).\r\n5. Coordination of emergency response plans and public protective actions with Local Emergency Responders and Local Emergency Planning Committees, where active.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program for anhydrous ammonia storage facilities at Aurora Cooperative involves four primary objectives. All anhydrous ammonia plant operators receive training on the hazards and safety procedures related to handling anhydrous ammonia. This training includes:\r\n1. Physical Hazards, emergency procedures and first aid.\r\n2. Plant normal and emergency start-up, o"

Plant design, including physical protection from identified hazards such as vehicular collision and installation of emergency shutoff valves.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThis fixed facility has experienced no reportable accidental releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nEmergency response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is accomplished by one of three methods, depending on the severity and anticipated duration of the release.\r\n1. For minor releases, most commonly caused by a valve leak or failure during operation and that are quickly isolated, trained operators, working from an upwind and safe location will isolate the leak to minimize the amount of product released. Safety equipment available to operators at all times includes indirect vented goggles, chemical resistant gloves, and air purifying respirators.\r\n2. For a more serious release that may be difficult to isolate, trained operators will notify city and county emergency management via the local sheriff\u00bfs office emergency telephone number along with a description of the difficulty, expected duration, recommended community protective actions and the need for assistance, if any. Hazmat-trained operators working with local emergency responders will don appropriate personal protective equipment to isolate the release. Protective actions for the public will be implemented as well as actions to minimize environmental impact from the release.\r\n3. In the event of a release that cannot be isolated due to the nature of the damage/failure or due to the lack of adequate personal protective equipment, the county emergency management organization will be notified via local sheriff\u00bfs office emergency telephone number, along with a description of the nature of the problem, recommended community protective actions and request for assistance, if any.
