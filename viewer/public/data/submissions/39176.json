ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of ammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all United Dairy, Fike?s Division personnel who operate the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n     The United Dairy, Fike?s Division PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its Ammonia Operating and Management Systems.  The United Dairy, Fike?s Division PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Engine Room Manager and the Principle Chief Refrigeration Engineer, have been deeply involved and they (along with the Refrigeration System Operators) assume the major responsibility for operating the Hazardous Material process safely.\n\n     The United Dairy, Fike?s Division Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the local Public Emergency Response Agency.  All United Dairy, Fike?s Division employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division operates an Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, Heat Treating and many, many more.  Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA a"

SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical Studies and Reports that are also required.\n\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE United Dairy, Fike?s DivisionACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division conducts annual in house emergency action training and maintains a relationship the local Public Emergency Response Agency to practice and update their Emergency Response Program\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division conducts an annual PSM/RMP progress audit of their PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements. United Dairy, Fike?s Division considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be a \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability and usefulness.\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division emphasizes and insists on \"employee participation\" from their ammonia process operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n    United Dairy, Fike?s Division provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program and management system with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia process employee.\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      United Dairy, Fike?s Division recognizes that even good PSM/RMP Programs require constant attention and improvement.  The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" truly becomes \"second nature\".\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division expects to improve PSM/RMP and safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program:\n\n (1)   Employee Participation is the \"Key\" to a successful program. Ammonia Process Managers and Operators have been deeply involved in Verifying P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n(2)    The United Dairy, Fike?s Division PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based,  (b)user friendly,  (c) includes \"one-on-one\" involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and  (e) written to be understood and used by both Ammonia Managers and Process Operators. \n\n(3)   All recommendations developed during the PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA) were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  United Dairy, Fike?s Division expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n(4)  Programs are audited regularly to improve the process as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations."
