      "SummaryText": "Tuscan Dairy manufactures fluid milk and beverage products at our plant in Union.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our product chillers and refrigerated coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\nA.  Describe the Accident Release  Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nTuscan Dairy takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe TCPA Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety systems.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates a refrigeration system with ammonia as the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Union plant.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n-  Employee Participation Program\n-  Process Safety Information\n-  Process Hazard An"

Five Year Accident History\n\nOne ammonia-related accident occurred at the Union plant in the past five years.  This incident involved injuries to two employees due to equipment failure.  The equipment was replaced following an investigation of the accident.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Union plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia  spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The plant response team utilizes employees who are trained to enter and stop an accidental ammonia release.\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTuscan Dairy is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective.  Planned improvements include computer control upgrade."
