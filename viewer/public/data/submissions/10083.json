The Facility Policy:\n    \n-The Owners, Management, and Employees of Farmers Co-op Oil Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire dept., or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n.\n2. Facility Information:\n\n    -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and propane sales and delivery.\n    -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. \n    -Propane is recieved, stored and distributed for home heating, farm and commercial business uses.\n    -The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 320,000 lbs. with our two 18,000 gal. storage tanks and nurse tank stock.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck transport tanker holding 40,000 lbs.\n    -The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 240,000 lbs with our two 30,000 gal. storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of truck transport tanker holding 40,000 lbs. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n    \nA.(1) The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 lbs., which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is .94 miles.\n\nA.(2) The worst case release scenario for propane is the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoin"

      "SummaryText": "t is .43 miles.  \n\nB.(1) The alternative release scenario of anhydrous ammonia is a 2 minute release from a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n     \nB.(2) The alternative release scenario of propane is the failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is (factor of .67 times .43) .29 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n     \nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  And NFPA-58 rules for propane.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History:\n     \nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n     \n- The facility has:\n\n     a. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information  as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n     c. and coordinate with the local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n     \nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia and propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
