Approximately 290 residents may be affected by this release. Systems in place to minimize the potential impact of this release include:  alarms on critical process parameters, tanks specifically designed for chlorine storage with recessed valves, experienced operators, and hazards assessment.\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Methyl chloroformate\n\nClinton Labs uses methyl chloroformate in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  The alternative case release scenario for methyl chloroformate involves a multiple vessel spill. This would allow 1,500 pounds of methyl chloroformate to be released in 108 minutes.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nClinton Labs has experienced four minor accidents as defined by Title 40 CFR 68.42 in the five year period prior to June 21, 1999.  Following is a brief description of each accident:\n\nOn August 2, 1995, a charge hose was disconnected from a tanker truck unloading ammonia.  As a result of the disconnect, residual liquid ammonia in the hose vaporized and exposed an employee.  Less than one pound of ammonia was released.  This incident did not impact the community; however, a plant employee was exposed to the ammonia vapors.  The employee was subsequently checked by medical personnel and released.  As a result, administrative controls and procedures were improved.  Affected employees were made aware of this and trained as needed.  This incident is identified as AccidentHistoryID:  8.  An amount of one pound was entered in the RPM Submit data field 6.5(b) because the program will not accept values less than one pound. \n\nOn March 17, 1995, a release of less than one pound of bromine occurred when a hazardous waste line was being cleaned.

This incident did not impact the community; however, a plant employee was exposed to a small amount of bromine vapors.  The employee was subsequently checked by medical personnel and released.

The Clinton Laboratories Neighbor Team helps keep the phone numbers used by CAN up to date by contacting the plant\u0012s near neighbors in Parke and Vermillion counties once a year. .                                                                                                                                                                           \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS\nSite emergency response teams undergo regular training by security coordinators and officers. These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country. In an emergency situation, a member of the plant security staff becomes the incident commander. The plant safety and security staff have responsibility for custom-designed, state-of-the-art response equipment. Vehicles on site include an ambulance, a fire fighting foam truck, a hazardous materials response truck and a rescue truck.   .                                                                                                                                                                           \n\u0015 FIRE BRIGADE/HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HAZMAT) TEAM\n-Team members are employees who hold full-time jobs in other parts of the plant. Around 80 people from various work shifts make up the team.\n-Professionally-trained responders are always on site, and all responders wear pagers when not at work.\n-Hazardous material response includes responding to hazardous spills or vapor releases. Responders are trained to use proper equipment and techniques to stabilize a hazardous area and rescue employees w"

      "SummaryText": "Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), a global research-based pharmaceutical corporation, is dedicated to delivering innovative pharmaceutical-based healthcare solutions that enable people to live longer, healthier and more active lives.  Lilly manufactures both human health products and animal health products at its Clinton Laboratories facility (Clinton Labs).  Clinton Labs is located approximately five miles north of Clinton, Indiana.  Excavation work to build Clinton Labs began in March of 1969; operations began in June of 1970.  Clinton Labs is located on a 700-acre site.  The plant itself includes 85 buildings on 140 acres.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Clinton Labs has designed and implemented, including:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n5. Five-year accident history\n6. The emergency response program\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nClinton Labs is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances. Clinton Labs has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. Clinton Labs\u0012 accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chem"

      "SummaryText": "icals.\n\nClinton Laboratories has a Plant Emergency Manual that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nClinton Labs plays an active roll in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also host plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nClinton Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (BPM), on the north end of the plant, manufactures bulk drug substances for human health products.  BPM makes the intermediate form of these products and ships them to other sites for finishing into capsules or pediatric medications.  Animal Health, on the south end of the plant, manufactures feed additives and other animal health products.  These products are finished and packaged on site for worldwide delivery to customers.  The third functional area, site services, is located primarily in the center of the plant, with other buildings throughout the p"

THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n \nEPA's RMP rule requires that Clinton Labs provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for the facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nLilly uses anhydrous ammonia as a feed stock for fermentation.  This worst case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of the tank (88,000 pounds) to escape in ten minutes.  According to the EPA\u0012s RMP Comp and EPA\u0012s standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic end point is 5.4 miles.  Approximately 10,000 residents may be affected by this release.  Administrative controls, including written operating procedures, limit the amount stored in the tank to 88,000 pounds, which is approximately 52 percent of"
