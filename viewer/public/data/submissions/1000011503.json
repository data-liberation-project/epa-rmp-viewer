Executive Summary  68.155\nThe City of St. Augustine Utilities Department operates the City of St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant #1 at 254 West King Street, St. Augustine, St. Johns County, Florida.  This plant is one of three water plants operated by the City.  The West King water plant is the only facility that has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Water Treatment Plant #1 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe City of St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n    The City of St. Augustine has a management system in place which is lead by the Public Works Director, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n    The City of St. Augustine maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Water Treatment Plant.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the City of St. AugustineA?s water plant Document Managemen"

AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA SITE  (b)\nThe City of St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant employs eleven (11) full-time and (1) one part time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n1.2.1.    SITE DESCRIPTION  (B)(1)\n    The site is owned and operated by The City of St. Augustine and managed by itA?s Utilities Department.  The site is located at 254 West King Street, City of St. Augustine, in St. Johns County, Florida.  The 5 acre site is located in a block area,  boarded by Palmer Street on the east, Travis Lane on the west, Rail Road Avenue on the north and West King Street on the south.\n    The Plant includes a separate chlorine storage open air building and adjacent control distribution system that is contained in a two separate process rooms of the main water plant pump building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  The City also stores 150 pound chlorine cylinders in an adjacent open air building.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.2.2.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n    Chlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 2,500 pound threshold quantity.  The City of St. Augustine chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine in one ton containers is received, stored and distributed to four process control systems. \n    Chlorine is an EPA listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive."

It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n\n1.3.    WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a A?worst case releaseA?.  The second is a more probable A?alternative release scenarioA?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that A?the &#61628; shall assume that the &#61628; maximum quantity in the largest vessel &#61628; is released as a gas over 10 minutesA?  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarioA?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpoint.A?  The EPA  specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The  3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individualA?s ability to take protective action.A?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, A?to estimate the population potentially affected.A?\n1.3.1.

This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of St. Augustine accidental release prevention program is based on EPAA?s RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the City of St. Augustine Fire/Rescue Department the Police Department and St JohnA?s County Haz Mat Team.\n1.4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\n    Plant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.

Equipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  This system is only inches long leading from the chlorine container to the pressure regulator bolted to the containers.  \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a chlorine monitor which detects the presence of chlorine in the ton storage area.  There is a chlorine monitor in the separate #150 lb. cylinders storage area.\n\n1.5.
