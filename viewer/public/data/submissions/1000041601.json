              "Description": "SuperValu's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The Plan includes a regular preventative maintenance  program (Mechanical Integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety review and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe appraoches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. SuperValu has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents. The program has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure that the PSM program is being implemented. The PSM program also incorpoares the facilities emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordiation of emergency response activities with the local fire department and other emergency reponse agencies.

This building complex includes a Perishable Warehouse with an ammonia refrigeration system which contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The closed ammonia refrigeration system at the Perishable Warehouse contains a maximum intended inventory of 16,400 pounds.  The facility is located in a urban setting in the industrial region of Green Bay, Wisconsin.  The facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Access to the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel.  Most of the service work is done by a service contractor.\n\n\n\nAn OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program is in place at the Perishable Warehouse.  Under that program, the major components of the process are inspected regularly.  Operating condidtions are continuously monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset.  The readily-distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the constantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing piping and equipment is located that even the slightest release may have occurred.  Most piping and all key shutoff valves are located on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions.  Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment from areas of safety, such as the maintenance and compressor room areas, were installed many years ago.  The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans, and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area.\n\n\n\nAs a testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years which have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nThe Brown County LEPC has included the "

The adjoining Ashwaubenon Fire Department maintains a successful HAZMAT squad that is constantly available to provide resources in the event of an accidental release.  Supervalu - Green Bay has adopted the Integrated Contigency Plan format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its on-site Emergency Action and Response Plan.  Under this plan emergency training and practice drills are frequent and cover a multitude of potential scenarios.  Four key managers become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammoni releases, and their duties are as follows: (a) coordination of and direction to on-site and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\n\n\n\nSupervalu - Green Bay continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it.
