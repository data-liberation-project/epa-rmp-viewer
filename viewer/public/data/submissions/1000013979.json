We operate under the policy for Environmental, Health and Safety of our parent company - General Electric.  The Spirit of the Letter states: \n\nGE is committed to achieving environmental, health and safety (EHS) excellence. This is a responsibility of management and employees in all functions. GE will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business. Our programs must combine clear leadership by management, the participation of all employees and functions, and the use of appropriate technology in developing and distributing GE products and services.\n\nRequirements\n-Comply with applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations.\n-Take appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, and to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment. Consider evolving industry practices, regulatory requirements and societal standards of care.\n-Assess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project. Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of GEA?s products and services.\n-Eliminate unreasonable risks from GEA?s facilities, products, services and activities.  \n-To the extent reasonably practicable, reduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution, and conserve, recover and recycle materials.\n-Continue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of GEA?s operational strategy.\n\nFacility Description and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGE Betz Inc., manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals that are primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers, refineries and cooling towers.

Depending on our customers' need, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000 gallon truckload quantities.  Similarly, the raw materials we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\nGE Betz - Beaumont Plant covers a total of 106 acres of land, of which only about 40 acres is used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities, outdoor material storage and parking lot.  The balance of the property consists of access roads, open lawn and idle areas.\n\nAllyl Alcohol, Epichlorohydrin, Formalin, Propylene Oxide and Dimethyamine are stored onsite in aboveground storage tanks.  Each of these products have unique properties used by our customers to help treat their waste or process waters.  Propylene oxide is used as a component of a polymerization inhibitor product used by the chemical industry. The use of such inhibitors help the chemical industry save energy and reduce waste and fouling in the equipment.  Epichlorohydrin (EPI) and Dimethylamine (DMA) are \"building block\" chemicals we use to make some of our other products.  Products made with EPI are used in the paper industry to help equipment function efficiently.  The benefit is the waste reduction.  Products made with DMA are used to clean water in water treatment facilities.  Allyl alcohol is used to manufacture dispersants used to reduce fouling in boilers and heat exchange equipment. The benefits are reduced energy consumption and increased equipment life.  Formalin is a raw material used in the production of flocculants used to clarify water and reduce dangerous levels of sulphur in crude oil.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to id"

The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of operating procedures, processes for insuring proper training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals, preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases, processes for managing changes in the process and conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur.  The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAt the GE Betz - Beaumont Plant we have not had any accidental releases that resulted in significant death, injury, property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage in the past 5 years due to the use or handling of Allyl Alcohol, Formalin, Propylene Oxide, Epichlorohydrin and Dimethylamine.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements:\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities\n- Fire extinguisher training  \n- Fire drills conducted by our facility\n- Spill and release control instructions\n- Evacuation procedures and external response notifications\n- Incident coordination with local emergency responders\n- Incident analysis and review with all plant personnel, and identification of procedure changes\n- Annual program review and re-training \n- In applicable regions: Hurricane preparedness and plant readiness procedures\n\nRecent and Planned Changes To Improve Safety & Environmental\n\nSince our original su"
