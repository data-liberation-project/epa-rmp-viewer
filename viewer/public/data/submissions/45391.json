This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Beef Packers, Inc. business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Beef Packers, Inc. facility is a commercial beef slaughter house and processing facility.  The main facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to the Kill Floor area, Offal Storage rooms, Chill Coolers and Boning Rooms. The Kill Floor  is cooled by two packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units. There are four Carcas Coolers and two Offal Storage rooms that are cooled by ceiling mounted fan coil units.  There are five Boning Rooms that are cooled by a combination of three packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units and ceiling mounted fan coil units.  A computer system provides substantia"

      "SummaryText": "The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \u00bfdump box\u00bf contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n    \nThe ammonia system at the main facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the main facility is treated as a single process.\n\nWest Coast Grinding is a beef grinding and packaging facility located on the Beef Packers, Inc. property.  This is a separate facility with a dedicated ammonia system that provides cooling to a single grinding room.  A ground mounted ACUair unit provides room cooling.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves and expansions valves.  From there, low pressure liquid is piped to the ACUair unit, where it passes through  solenoid valves and hand expansion valves and into evaporator  coils.

The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in the grinding room, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \u00bfdump box\u00bf contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n    \nThe ammonia system at the Grinding facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the Grinding facility is treated as a single process.\n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Beef Packers, Inc. facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The systems contain a total charge of approximately 30,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures"

In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia through the course of our normal safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n4. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOn July 3, 2001 Beef Packers, Inc. had an accidental release of ammonia at its facility.  The insident happened around 2:00pm.  At this time a pressure relief valve on the roof of the facility releaved due to overpressurization in the associated vessel.  The overpressurization was determine to be the result of operations on the plant water system which affected water pressure leading to an upset in the ammonia refrigeration system.  The duration of the release was estimated at 7 to 10 minutes before the pressure relief valve reseated.  The amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 600lbs. Residents near the Beef Packers, Inc. facility were able to smell the ammonia vapors and were instructed to shelter-in-place until the ammonia passed by and disipated.  Within two hours of the insident the Fire Dept. and the Governer\u00bfs Office of Emergency Services were notified.  The G.O.E.S. file number is 01-3831.  As a result of the insident Beef Packers, Inc. determined to modify the refrigeraiton system such that the vessel in question and others like it were removed eliminating the pressure relief valves and the potential for further accidental releases of this nature.\n\n5. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8"

Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. To better prepare for this type of action, initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place within the next year. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nAt least once each year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Beef Packers, Inc. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Beef Packers, Inc. business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely th"

Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Beef Packers, Inc. now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00bfliving document\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Beef Packers, Inc. employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Beef Packers, Inc. will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
