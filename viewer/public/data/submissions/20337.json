The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\nKuehne Chemical has in place three programs designed to address accidental release prevention and emergency response issues.  These programs have been reviewed and approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  The first program is the Discharge Prevention Containment and Countermeasure Plan.  This plan is designed to ensure Kuehne Chemical has the appropriate precautionary procedures in place to address likely release scenarios.  This plan focuses on release prevention.  Second, Kuehne Chemical has in place a Discharge Cleanup and Removal Plan.  This plan is designed to ensure Kuehne Chemical has the ability to initiate a response to a release.  The DCR plan outlines actions Kuehne Chemical intends to take to mitigate the effects of the release and to minimize off-site impact.  The third plan is Kuehne Chemical's Emergency Response Plan.  This plan provides emergency response information for the most likely emergency incidents and release scenarios.  The plan addresses on-site and off-site response activities for both HAZMAT and medical related incidents.  This plan includes the recommendations established in the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities\n\nB. The stationary source and regulated substances handles;\n\nAt the South Kearny facility, Kuehne Chemical repackages and distributes chlorine and sulfur dioxide.     \n\nC. The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario:\n\nEPA has designated the \"Worst Case Release Scenario\" to be based upon the total failure of the largest tank or vessel at the facility and a total release of the hazardous substance in a"

As stated in \"A\" above, Kuehne Chemical has three major programs in place, which addresses accidental release prevention issues.  Furthermore, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act has regulated Kuehne Chemical since the programs inception.
