If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity of Verdegaal Brothers, Inc is the storage and sale of fertilizer.  For this RMP, a non hazardous fertilizer is producted from a mobile reactor.  The The substance(s) that are occasionally stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received via rail car and reacted with Phosphoric Acid to produce ammonium poly-phosphate fertilizer.  This end product is considered non-hazardous.  This fertilizer is utilized for land application in crop production.  The reactor utilized in this process is not the property of Verdegaal Brothers, Inc.  It is a private company that travels with this equipment to various states providing service for retail fertilizer locations.  No employee of Verdegaal Brothers, Inc is involved in this processing.  The sole reason the regulated substance is on Verdegaal Brothers, Inc property is for the purpose of making this non-hazardous end product fertilizer.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternate Release Scenerio\nThe worst-case release scenerio for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represent the volume of the largest rail car at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.  The alternate release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has developed a written Business Emergency Response Plan.  The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1919.120, EPA 40 CFR part 264, subpart D and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - FRP - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements within this plan include employee training.  SARA Title III reporting requirements and Community Right-to Know pre-planning and emergency response information.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe users of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc (ANSI K61.1); California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\" and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admiistration, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental releases or near misses of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvements is an on-going process at the facility, and by the owner of the reactor.  Periodic evacuations are performed to assiss the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia rail cars pr processes at the facility."
