The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receivers\n\nThe purpose of each high pressure receiver is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condenser and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system; it is located on High Pressure Receiver 3. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters th"

Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators in the cold storage rooms is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. The liquid ammonia enters the bottom of the evaporator coil and as the liquid boils into a vapor, it rises through the coil and returns to the connected flood accumulator. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporator (Direct Expansion)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporator in the hallway is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporator receives liquid from the high pressure receivers. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator.

Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporator contains low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nMain Suction Accumulator\n\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\n\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receivers. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain, by gravity, into High Pressure Receiver 3. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphe"

Each compressor has an integral oil separator that receives the high pressure vapor and separates residual oil from the ammonia so that the oil can be returned to the compressor. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condenser\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condenser is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators and compressors to the atmosphere. The evaporative condenser receives high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supplies high pressure liquid to High Pressure Receiver 3. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. Water is contained in the sump of the condenser, which is then pumped and sprayed over the ammonia coil. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condenser contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nAmmonia Detection\n\nThere are two (2) stand-alone ammonia detectors and one sampling system installed at Arctic Cold Storage, LLC.

The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each compressor package:\n\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\n\nLow Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\n\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\n\n\n\nHigh Level Float Switch\n\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\n\n\n\nMain Liquid Feed Shut-Off Valve (King Valve)\n\nThe high pressure receivers are equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Refrigeration Switch (E-Stop)\n\nThe machinery room is equipped with an emergency refrigeration switch (e-stop) that controls power to the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room. The switch can be activated in an emergency by accessing the ECB.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Process Classification\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Arctic Cold Storage, LLC consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
