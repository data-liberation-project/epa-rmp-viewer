      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is for the 8,500-gallon aboveground storage tank system containing 37% formaldehyde solution at the AgroChem facility located in Saratoga Springs, New York. This RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68, Subpart G, and is required for all facilities that store greater than a threshold quantity of a hazardous substance regulated under 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde solutions are classified as a toxic chemical per the OSHA and EPA standards, with a threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds and 15,000 pounds, respectively. The facility's formaldehyde storage system was expanded to include an 8,500-gallon aboveground storage tank with the result that total formaldehyde capacity is approximately 28,345 pounds. Hence, an RMP must be prepared and implemented.\r\n\r\nThe AgroChem facility has one covered process, the 8,500-gallon aboveground storage tank system containing 37% formaldehyde solution. Because the release of formaldehyde has the potential to impact offsite receptors, and because formaldehyde is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR \u00a71910.119, the process has been determined to be a \"Program Level 3\" process. The basic process safety management program elements for a Program 3 process are covered in detail in the \"AgroChem Process Safety Management Program\".\r\n\r\nIn addition to the PSM elements, the RMP regulations require that subject facilities evaluate the consequences of off-site releases. The scenarios used in AgroChem's consequence assessment were selected from a review of the process hazard analysis conducted in February of 2017.  A summary of the scenarios are as follows:\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario at the AgroChem facility would be the catastrophic failure/spill of the 37% formaldehyde 8,500-gallon storage tank into the tank's secondary containment system within the bulk chemical storage room.  The secondary containment system is approximately 2,"

      "SummaryText": "100 square feet by 3 feet in depth.  The maximum release quantity was conservatively estimated to be an almost instantaneous 8,500 gallons from a catastrophic failure into the tank's secondary containment system.  It should be noted that the formaldehyde solution is typically warm/hot during delivery operations at approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit and this temperature was conservatively used to determine the evaporation of formaldehyde within the bulk storage room.  Using evaporation equations obtained from Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals with Applications (1990, Daniel Crowl, Joseph Louvar), the evaporation rate of 37% formaldehyde solution from the secondary containment system is 11.0 pounds per minute (1.2 gallons per minute).\r\n\r\nFor the worst-case release, EPA requires that a worst-case set of meteorological conditions be used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint.  This includes a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F (extremely stable). Under these conditions, a vapor cloud could travel the greatest distance with minimal dilution or dispersion. It also assumes uniform release rates, wind speed, and wind direction. Again, these are extremely conservative worst-case assumptions designed to assure that the worst possible scenario is addressed.\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario was calculated using the calculated formaldehyde evaporation rate and the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis (EPA 550-B-99-009, March 2009) Reference Table 4, which equated to a distance of 0.4 miles. This is the farthest distance that a formaldehyde cloud could travel under the worst-case release scenario. The residential population within this mile radius of the plant was estimated to be approximately 5 (5 housing units). This figure is based on 2010 census data for Saratoga Springs within the potential release radius using the MARPLOT software.  The facility"

      "SummaryText": "'s emergency procedures for evacuation, notification and response include evaluation of wind direction.\r\n \r\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nEPA requires that owners/operators identify and analyze at least one alternative release scenario, in addition to the worst-case. This is defined as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such credible scenario exists. This generally implies the need for a relatively large release rate. While there are several possible failure scenarios at the AgroChem facility, few of these produce off-site impacts that affect populations or environmental receptors. \r\n\r\nThe worst alternative case scenario was determined to be a release of formaldehyde solution from the 8,500-gallon aboveground storage tank from a pump or valve failure/leak into the secondary containment system within the building. It was assumed that the failure occurred after hours on a Friday, such that the discovery of the leak/spill would not occur until Monday morning.  By this time, it is conservatively assumed that the entire contents of the 8,500-gallon tank would be released into the secondary containment system.  Using evaporation equations obtained from Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals with Applications (1990, Daniel Crowl, Joseph Louvar), the evaporation rate of 37% formaldehyde solution from the indoor 8,500-gallon tank secondary containment system is approximately 11 pounds per minute (1.2 gallons per minute).\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios use a more realistic set of meteorological parameters including an atmospheric stability class of \"D\" and a wind speed of 3 meters per second. These parameters provide significantly greater dispersion than the worst-case parameters.  \r\n \r\nThe calculation of the toxic endpoint distance from the release of formaldehyde within the secondary containment system located in the building using the evaporation equations obtained from Chemical Proces"
