Lushton complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Henderson Fire Dept. and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  There is no full-time employee at this site.\n\nWe used Degadis to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  We have these passive and active mitigation devices including drains, excess flow valves, relief valves, check valves and manual shut-off valves.  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in the transfer hose.\n\nWe comply with all applicable state codes and regulations and have attended Ammonia Safety and Maintenance School sponsored by the Nebraska Fertilizer & Ag-Chem Association.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program is in the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Henderson Fire Dept. and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department:  members of the fire department have inspected our system.  The facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to"
