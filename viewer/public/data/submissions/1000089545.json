If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Montrose Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency. \r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Ft. Madison Terminal is owned by GROWMARK Inc., propane is received via pipeline and stored in pressure tanks.  From these vessels, propane is loaded into tanker trucks for distribution.  Propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Ft. Madison Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal; however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has developed the worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld from the Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations. \r\n\r\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAt the Ft. Madison Terminal we handle propane that is recognized by the EPA as a regulated, flammable substance.

Madison Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this terminal include:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7 Emergency shutoff valves at each loading hose supplied with cables for remote closure in the event of a hose rupture or piping break.\r\nA\u00b7 Level, pressure, temperature and relief instrumentation on storage tanks to help prevent overfilling.\r\nA\u00b7 Hydrocarbon gas detectors located in the area of the truck loading pumps and the truck loading area, the most likely locations of a leak.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm and trigger the emergency shutdown system.\r\nA\u00b7 Excess flow valves on the inlet lines and outlet lines for each storage tank to shut-off the tank during large release situations.\r\nA\u00b7 Solenoid operated valves on each storage tank liquid inlet and outlet line, which can be activated by hitting the emergency shutdown button.\r\nA\u00b7 Product flow to the two truck loading lanes controlled via an Accuload III system which monitors mercaptan addition, verifies proper grounding, and records the amount of product loaded..\r\n\r\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operational performance which includes the prevention of incidents, injuries, and releases at the facility.
