This facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program due to the type and quantity of toxic chemical that is located onsite. \n\n\n\nThe Coughlin Power Station's environmental, safety, and health policies empha the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. The Coughlin Power Station has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years. One part of these programs is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated toxic substance stored onsite above the applicable threshold quantity. There are no RMP regulated chemicals that exceed RMP thresholds. \n\n\n\nChlorine is also stored on site; however it is stored in quantities below the threshold quantity for chlorine. It should be noted however that chlorine is stored in quantities above the threshold quantity under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\nThe Coughlin Power Station has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, to its employees, and to the preservation of the environment. One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The Coughlin Power Station utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  The Coughlin Power Station's"

In the event of a release, trained emergency response teams will make necessary efforts to contain, mitigate, monitor, and/or stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe USEPA has defined a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\" A Worst-Case Release Scenario (WCS) analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process. WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and an ambient air temperature of 25?C (77?F). Topography for WCSs is distinguished between rural and urban. Rural terrain was chosen as a conservative input.\n\n\n\nToxic gases include all regulated toxic substances that are gases at ambient temperature (temperature 25? C, 77?F), even if they are stored as liquids under pressure or refrigeration. For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.\n\n\n\nFor toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface. For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released for the pipeline is assumed to form a pool. Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in the consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids. In this scenario, the Toxic Endpoint was determined to be 0.14 mg/L using the RMP*Comp program.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, being the only toxic substance exceeding the threshold quantity, was determined to result in the WCS for re"

The distance to the endpoint of a 10-minute release of the entire quantity of the anhydrous ammonia was calculated using the RMP*Compprogram and determined to be 3.6 miles. Based on this distance, a WCS of this toxic would affect a population of approximately 721 individuals. The approximated affected population data was obtained from the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) Version 10C. \n\n\n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those cited for a WCS. One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a covered process that exceedsthreshold quantity. For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fence line. Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\n\nA single ARS for the anhydrous ammonia is required under Risk Management; however two separate hypothetical but likely to occur release scenarios were identified for the anhydrous ammonia and the more conservative scenario with the greater Distance to Toxic Endpoint was chosen for use.\n\n\n\nAs per the regulations at 40 CFR 68.28, COPS considered the following scenarios as alternative scenarios:\n\nTransfer hose releases due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling \n\nProcess piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds&#8232;Process vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure\n\nVessel overfilling and spill, or overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks&#8232;Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill\n\nOther failure scenarios identified under 40 CFR 68.67 [Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)]\n\n\n\nHowever, all of the"

A 1-inch hole in the vessel causes an airborne release from a one-inch opening at a pressure of 145 psia. The release is assumed to continue for 10 minutes as the liquid vaporizes immediately. The height of the liquid column above the hole is approximately two feet. The release rate of the anhydrous ammonia was determined to be approximately 2,400 lbs/minute. The distance to the endpoint of a 10-minute release at a rate of 2,400 lbs/minute of anhydrous ammonia was calculated using the RMP*Comp program and determined to be 0.9 miles. Based on this distance, an ARS of this toxic would affect a population of approximately 180 individuals. The approximated affected population data was obtained from the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) Version 10C.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The facility has existing safety features in place applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  These features include but are not limited to: (1) employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, (2) a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes, (3) a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled (4) a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process, (5) pre-startup safety reviews for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information, (6"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the operating procedures discuss consequences of deviating from the safe limits and provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Changes to operating procedures are tracked through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.
