The facility maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance. The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination. All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures. Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \nDetails of the release scenarios are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan. \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM \nSpecific responsibilities are summarized in the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan."

Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.   \nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.    \nThe facility has a policy of investigating every catastrophic incident, including those which may have possibly resulted in a catastrophic release under slightly different circumstances, in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring.  The facility has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.   \n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThis plant does not have any incidents within the last 5-years that would meet this criteria: \u201caccidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\u201d\n\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThis facility is a responding facility and has coordinated the emergency respons"

This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nThe Velma Gas Plant is located one mile west of Velma, Oklahoma on old Highway 7 and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products and byproducts:\n1. Y grade natural gas liquid (NGL),\n2. Condensate, and\n3. Residue (methane) gas\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon\ncomponents. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. The site has changed its policy regarding processing sour gas and has plugged the acid gas injection well; therefore, the toxic release scenario with hydrogen sulfide is no longer applicable.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThis facility is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals - PSM), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are in place to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \nThis facility has implemented the PSM elements to facilitate accidental release prevention.
