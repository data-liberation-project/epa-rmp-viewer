      "SummaryText": "1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the blending, repackaging, bulk and warehouse storage of chemicals, and their distribution via Univar's fleet of delivery trucks. We have four regulated toxic substances present above threshold quantities at our facility. These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine], Formaldehyde (solution) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid]. These substances are delivered to our facility by common carrier truck in sealed, UN rated containers and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end-use customers. Cyclohexylamine is also delivered in bulk by tank truck and repackaged into UN rated containers. \n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The EPA?s RMP*Comp(TM) software was used for modeling purposes.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Bulk Operations. In this scenario, 36,250 pounds of Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine] is released. The toxic liquid releas"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.16 mg/L of Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine] is 0.1 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine] involves a release from Warehousing Operations.  The scenario involves the release of 180 pounds from a shipping container either damaged in handling or punctured in storage leading to a spill. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 5 minutes.

      "SummaryText": "placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nUnivar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. Since this is a new facility (stationary source), an audit is yet to be conducted.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUnivar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. The company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.Emergency"

      "SummaryText": " Response Plan\nOur facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department is the primary local emergency response agency with whom our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Expanding the facility training program to incorporate annual refresher training in additional subjects and evaluating the feasibility of designating specific movement routes for transport of selected regulated substances by lift truck are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by March 1, 2001."
