      "SummaryText": "Please see attached document.\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND\n\n\n\nGenOn Delta, LLC owns and operates Pittsburg Generating Station (PGS), an electric power generating facility located in West Pittsburg, California in Contra Costa County. There are seven existing units at PGS: Units 1-4 which have been retired and Units 5-7 which continue to operate for electric power generation.  Units 5 and 6 are each rated at 325 MW and Unit 7 is rated at 720 MW.  The boilers for Units 5 and 6 were manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox and the boiler for Unit 7 was manufactured by Combustion Engineering.\n\n \n\nThe existing Units 5 and 6 at PGS have been retrofitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as required to comply with Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 11, \"Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Electric Power Generating Steam Boilers\".  The retrofit of Unit 6 with an SCR system was completed in February of 2002 and the retrofit of Unit 5 with an SCR system was completed in June of 2002.  At the time that the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems were designed and constructed, it was also planned to retrofit Unit 7 with a SCR system.  Since that time, the project to retrofit Unit 7 with a SCR system was cancelled.  This document addresses the aqueous ammonia systems that are associated with the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems.\n\n\n\nThe SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from the generating units. The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 29.4% by weight. This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both Federal and California regulations.\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was established in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The California Office of Emergency Services established the California Accidental Release "

The CalARP Program specifies the regulated substances, oversees the federal requirements, and determines the requirements for the preparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and offsite accidental release consequence analysis. In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD).\n\n\n\nWith the addition of the SCR systems, the quantity of aqueous ammonia that is stored and used at Pittsburg Generating Station is greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities; therefore, a RMP is required. As shown in this RMP, a worst-case release from the PGS aqueous ammonia system would cause the toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia (200yppmv) to occur offsite, in an area of Suisun Bay to which the public has access. Therefore, the process cannot be classified as Program 1. Although, aqueous ammonia is listed as a regulated substance in Section 2770.5 of CalARP regulations, the power generation industry is not specifically required to submit extensive Program 3 RMP requirements, and the CCCHSD has determined that the risk posed by this process does not justify classifying the process as Program 3. Accordingly, this process qualifies for a Program 2 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations. \n\n\n\nIn order to fulfill the Program 2 requirements, the following actions were completed:\n\n\n\n* Analyze a worst-case and alternative release scenario and perform an offsite consequence analysis.\n\n* Describe the site's accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \n\n* Ensure that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.\n\n* Describe the site's safety program.\n\n* Describe the site's hazard review program.\n\n* Describe the site's operating procedures.\n\n* Describe the site'"

PGS strives to conduct business in a manner that protects the environment and the safety and health of the public and its employees by: \n\n\n\n* Meeting all environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements.\n\n* Pursuing opportunities to enhance the quality of the environment. \n\n* Promoting employee understanding of environmental issues. \n\n* Ensuring that employees are aware of their individual roles and responsibilities.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to continue to improve the environmental, safety and health performance and to minimize accidental releases, numerous environmental, safety and health programs are implemented at PGS along with on-going personnel training activities that are described in Section 1.7.1 and 1.7.4 respectively of this RMP.

In the SCR systems, aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tanks, to a vaporizer, which produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia that is then mixed with the flue gas from the boiler and passed over a reducing catalyst to reduce the NOx emissions from the stack exhaust. \n\n\n\n1.3.1 Ammonia Systems\n\n\n\nThe systems that handle aqueous ammonia at PGS are the aqueous ammonia storage facility, the aqueous ammonia vaporization skid, and the ammonia injection grid/SCR reactor. \n\n\n\n1.3.1.1 Aqueous Ammonia Storage Facility\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage facility consists of a truck unloading station and three aqueous ammonia storage tanks. The storage facility has been designed and constructed to receive and store aqueous ammonia for three different SCR systems: the retrofitted Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems and a planned SCR system for Unit 7 that has not been installed.  At the present time, the aqueous ammonia storage tanks for the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems are in service.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank that was installed for the Unit 7 SCR system is currently empty.  The aqueous ammonia storage facility is located near the northern portion of the developed property of the Pittsburg Generating Station, immediately to the west of Unit 7.\n\nThe storage facility that currently services the SCR systems for Unit 5 and Unit 6 includes three 21,200-gallon capacity carbon steel storage tanks that are approximately 10 feet in diameter and 38 feet long.  The effective maximum volume of each storage tank is limited to 20,000 gallons through administrative controls which include operating procedures that require a check of the storage tank level prior to filling the tank to confirm that the tank has sufficient free volume to accept the ammonia delivery without exceeding 20,000 gallons.

The tanks have a maximum design pressure and temperature of 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and 110F, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tanks are supported horizontally on concrete foundations within a walled containment basin approximately 65 feet long by 55 feet wide that slopes to a centrally located, covered sump located beneath the tanks and running the width of the containment area. This sump is 14 feet wide by 55 feet long and 7 feet deep and provides a volume sufficient to hold 145 percent of the capacity of a single ammonia storage tank, plus the maximum rainfall recorded in the Pittsburg area over a 24-hour period in the past 43 years (3.03 inches, WRCC 1955-1998). Although the sump has been designed to accommodate rainfall in accordance with the applicable codes, a sump pump has been provided to keep it free of rainwater. The sump pump is interlocked with the ammonia monitoring system so that it does not operate if ammonia vapors are detected.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is delivered to Pittsburg Generating Station via tanker truck. Individual tanker trucks can transport up to 6,500 gallons of aqueous ammonia. The containment area for the unloading area is designed to contain 105 percent of the volume of a 6,500-gallon tanker truck. The area is sloped to quickly drain any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia into the central covered containment sump. Each storage tank has an unloading station consisting of an ammonia fill line, where aqueous ammonia is fed from the delivery truck to the tank, and a vapor return line where vapor pressure between the tank and the truck is equalized. \n\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Aqueous Ammonia Vaporization Skid\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to spray nozzles inside the ammonia vaporizer unit that is mounted on the vaporizer "

The vaporizer produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia in the diluent stream. The diluent stream is then transported to the injection grid.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is pumped through 3/4 inch stainless steel piping from the storage tank to the vaporizer skid.  All electric forwarding pumps and associated piping are located within the walled storage tank containment area. The piping between the storage tank containment area and the nearest edge of the Unit 7 building is contained in a covered trench located under the road and parking area to protect the piping from vehicular traffic. The trench under the road that houses the aqueous ammonia piping drains into the sump under the aqueous ammonia storage tanks in the containment area. In addition, the primary piping is contained within larger diameter PVC piping for all stretches that are not within the storage facility containment area or in the trench under the road. Therefore, secondary containment is provided for all sections of aqueous ammonia piping.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Ammonia Injection Grid / SCR\n\n\n\nThe ammonia injection grid provides additional mixing of the diluent stream and transports it to the SCR.  The SCR reactor converts much of the ammonia and oxides of nitrogen from the flue gas into nitrogen gas and water, which are released from the stack.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia injection grid is located upstream of the SCR reactor. This allows more thorough mixing of the ammonia-laden diluent stream with the turbulent flue gas from the boiler. Although the oxidation-reduction reaction is initiated by the injection of ammonia at the injection grid, all of the reaction is completed in the SCR reactor by passing the mixture over a catalyst composed primarily of titanium and vanadium oxides.

A downstream analyzer measures the total NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet. The ammonia demand signal, which regulates the rate at which aqueous ammonia is pumped to the vaporizer, is determined from the readings of both NOx analyzers.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Aqueous Ammonia Hazards\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia solution that is used for the SCR systems at PGS is 29.4 percent ammonia by weight, with the balance of the weight being water. Aqueous ammonia is a corrosive material although the degree of danger associated with the substance is considered minor. Ammonia is not a known carcinogen, but it poses acute and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards to the respiratory system and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards as skin irritations or other effects. Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\n\nThough there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution, the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound that is also used for SCR systems. The ammonia present will not readily vaporize if the solution is released to the atmosphere. If the ammonia evaporates from the solution, the ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few parts per million by volume (ppmv) and acutely toxic in high concentrations. A one-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals. \n\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ignition. Ammonia concentrations directly above an aqueous ammonia spill never approach these concentrations; therefore, aqueous ammonia has no explosive"

In order to support the achievement of accident free operation, a management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the various RMP elements.  In this management system, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements. An organizational chart showing the titles of those positions assigned responsibility for implementing the individual RMP program elements and defining the lines of authority has been developed.  Each position which has been assigned responsibility for the different RMP elements reports changes that affect the RMP to the Plant Manager who ensures that all affected elements of the RMP are updated appropriately and that the local CUPA is kept abreast of all changes to the RMP.  The individual RMP elements, such as training, emergency response, etc., are outlined in this RMP. \n\n \n\nIn accordance with the federal and CalARP regulations, this RMP will be updated within five years of the most recent update, before any additional regulated substance is brought onsite, before additional aqueous ammonia storage is installed, or if there is a major change that may alter the offsite consequence analysis.  At PGS, records supporting the different aspects of the RMP are maintained for at least five years.\n\n \n\nThe concentration of aqueous ammonia is not high enough to be regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \n\n\n\n1.6 CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS  \n\n\n\nSafety was one of the foremost considerations when the aqueous"
