      "SummaryText": "BPU NEARMAN WATER TREATMENT PLANT:\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nRelease prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Kansas City Board of Public Utilities (BPU) is required to comply with a variety of safety and environmental regulations in the course of operating BPU treatment facilities.  One of these regulations addresses the safe use and handling of hazardous chemicals which is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Rule 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68; requiring development of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that deals with the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals to the atmosphere.  This rule is primarily concerned with the offsite effects of chemical spills or leaks that may occur within a facility.  BPU is committed to keeping the community safe and providing safe drinking water.\n\nBPU takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its Nearman Water Treatment Plant (NWTP) by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of processes, including processes subject to the Part 68 Rule.  This training includes the safe handling and maintenance of regulated substances under the rule.\n\nBPU has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  Though these rules do not specifically address the covered process and its regulated substance, compliance with the general rules significantly reduces the potential for accidental releases of the regulated substance.  This facility complies with industry-standard practices for water treatment plants that use chlorine in bulk. \n\nAs for emergency response, BPU has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and action.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  In general, BPU plant employees would deal only with releases of a small amount of a regulated substance.  If the release is determined to be large or if t"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nBPU's Nearman WTP has a design capacity of 72-million-gallon per day and treats raw water from underground wells in the Missouri River flood plain and provides drinking water to the community.  It does this through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that includes rapid mix and flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and chlorine disinfection.  The treated water, now ready for use by the public, is transferred to a large reservoir and pumped into the distribution system. \n\nThe regulated substance stored, handled, and used at this facility is chlorine. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 32 containers on site.  All of the chlorine containers are stored inside of a building.  The chlorine building is equipped with a scrubber system.  \n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program for chlorine complies with EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 Rule for Program 2 processes.  To maintain compliance, BPU has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee-training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees and supervisors involved in operating the covered process.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, scrubber and industry-standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine.\n\nShould the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the NWTP is equipped with engineering controls designed"

The plant also has a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during a chlorine release. \n\nFor the worst-case and alternative analyses scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (TM), ALOHA, MARPLOT and Maptitude (2020 Census Data) was used.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nThere have been no incidents in the past five years.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThis facility has established and maintains an Emergency Response Plan, an Emergency Response Action Plan, and BPU falls under the Wyandotte County Emergency Operations Plan.  BPU holds annual Tabletops with first responders, which include Wyandotte County Emergency Management, Kansas City Kansas Police Department, and the Kansas City Kansas Fire Department and local HAZMAT team.  The goals of the aforementioned Plans are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of releases to the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  It is also discussed with local emergency planners along with scenarios and trainings to ensure the public's safety. In addition, these Tabletop scenarios are held with employees and local emergency responders to ensure preparedness in the event of an emergency.  \n\nFacility employees handle small incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe NWTP added a tiered set of chlorine leak detector alarm levels in 2015. The range of alarm setting concentrations will help determine an increase or decrease of chlorine level in a room during an emergency.\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from emplo"

Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Risk Management Plan, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or is being considered and evaluated for implementation.  This evaluation process will provide all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
