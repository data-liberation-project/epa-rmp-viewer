Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and operations facilities.  Conoco's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan.  \n\n This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Cashion Gas Plant, located in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, is jointly owned by Conoco Inc. (80%) and Liquid Energy Corporation (20%), and operated by the Conoco NG&GP Department.  The Cashion Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that receives raw natural gas and natural gas liquid streams by pipeline.  The site consists of inlet gas separation, dehydration, cryogenic gas processing (recovery of natural gas liquids), product storage and loading equipment.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline and truck.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Cashion Gas Plant's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the threshold quantities.  [Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance wi"

There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Cashion Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure.  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  PBC (Propane- Butane-Condensate) Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the PBC in the largest PBC vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n Passive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Cashion Gas Plant follows a rigorous Mechanical Integr"

For the Cashion Gas Plant, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the EPBC Mix pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for ten minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as leak detection gas detection and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact, but there is no impact to any receptors (i.e., residential populations, industrial, etc.), as determined by the use of the OCA guidance, the \"Landview\" program census data, and actual survey data.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Cashion Gas Plant adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Cashion Gas Plant.  The Cashion Gas Plant has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.  As a result, this overview describes the safety management system that is in place for each of the safety management program elements, which also make up the Risk Management Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll employees (and contractors) at the Cashion Gas Plant are involved and participate in all facets of Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention.

All approved mitigation options are then tracked as part of the process until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted every 5 years and will continue at this frequency as long as the plant is in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cashion Gas Plant maintains a variety of technical data that is used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These data and documents include written data and engineering drawings on the design of the facility, the chemistry of the process and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Whenever a process modification is made, the procedures are revised as appropriate to cover the modification.  The procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThese procedures are used in employee training, and are readily available to employees to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Cashion Gas Plant employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.  New employees receive job-specific basic training in gas plant operations. All operating and maintenance personnel receive facility-specific process overview training.  Each employee receives training on, among other things, (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  They are thereby trained in the specific knowledge, skills, and procedures needed to safely conduct their work.  In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.
