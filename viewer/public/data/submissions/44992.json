(SSCE), Brewton, Alabama mill to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine dioxide is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be reduced. To accomplish this the chlorine dioxide process equipment is maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices. Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine dioxide system have been trained in the requirements of chlorine dioxide safety.\n\nDescription of Brewton Mill Operations\n\nThe SSCE facility produces a solid bleached sulfate paper and mottled white linerboard. In the process of bleaching pulp chlorine dioxide is utilized.\n\nDescription of RMP processes:\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nChlorine dioxide is used for the bleaching of pulp used at the mill. Chlorine Dioxide is manufactured on-site by combining sodium chlorate (NaCLO3), methanol (CH3OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sodium chlorate is reacted under certain conditions of acidity and temperature and with the addition of a reducing agent (methanol) chlorine dioxide is produced. Mill production equipment can produce up to 35 tons per day of a 10 gram per liter (g/L) chlorine dioxide solution, which is stored in two above ground storage tanks. These tanks have a total capacity of 344,000 gallons (172,000 each). \n\nFive-year accidental release history\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents due to releases of chorine dioxide within the last five years of 2001 to date. \n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nSSCE has a OSHA Process Safety Management program in place covering its chlorine dioxide operations. This PSM program meets the requirements of the RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the Brewton facility's RMP.\n\nThe OSHA PSM plan and documentation is maintained in the Technical  Department by"

Mill personnel will handle incidental releases of chlorine dioxide as identified in the mill Emergency Action Plan. Emergency releases of chlorine dioxide will be handled in cooperation with the Brewton Fire Department and local emergency officials. Outside resources such as emergency response contractors will be utilized as necessary based on the severity of the situation. The Brewton Fire Department will be notified by calling 911. The Brewton Fire Department has been informed of the usage of chlorine dioxide and has been provided information on the covered RMP/PSM processes. \n\nInitial response to a 911 call will come from the City of Brewton Fire Department. If the incident requires additional equipment or assistance the Brewton Fire Department will contact additional response agencies such as Escambia County Emergency Management for the needed support.\n\nThe mill has a written Emergency Action Plan which is up-to-date and copies are maintained through the mill.\n\nThe Brewton Fire Department has been given the opportunity to visit the facility and tour the areas of concern for emergency response coordination.\n\nPlanned improvements to improve safety.\n\nThe Brewton Mill implemented a new state-of-the-art chlorine dioxide manufacturing process in 2000. This process has eliminated the use of elemental chlorine for our pulp bleaching and replaced our previous R-2 chlorine dioxide process. The Brewton Mill continually looks for opportunities to improve the safety of its operations. This is accomplished through on-going safety audits, safety meetings and preventive maintenance and inspection activities. Opportunities for safety improvement are r"
