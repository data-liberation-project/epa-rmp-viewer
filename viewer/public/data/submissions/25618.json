Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have four RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine. Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substance is stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Chlorine is received in 150 pound cylinders which are stored at the Martinsville facility for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Chlorine onsite at any one time will be 15000 pounds.\n\n2. Sulfur Dioxide is received in 150 pound cylinders which are stored at the Jacksonville facility for distribution to end use customers.The estimated maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide onsite at any one time will be 7500 pounds.  \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RMP substances in inventory onsite. Each RMP liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes. By using Cla"
