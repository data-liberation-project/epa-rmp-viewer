The accidental release prevention policy at the Municipal\nAuthority of Westmoreland CountyA?s, Connellsville treatment facility\ninvolves a combined effort between management, operating and local\nemergency personnel.  The facility has an ongoing effort to identify\nhazards, review safety techniques, and implement employee training\nthrough operation, maintenance and inspection procedures to manage the\nrisk of a chlorine gas release.\n\nB.    The Municipal Authority of Westmoreland CountyA?s, Connellsville\ntreatment facility was originally placed into operation in 1970.  The\nfacility currently has the capacity of treating 45 million gallons per\nday of water.  Gaseous chlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is\nutilized to disinfect the effluent prior to discharging to the receiving\nwater.  The amount of chlorine handled is ten one-ton containers for a\ntotal of 20,000 pounds.  The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted\nand are designed for conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine\nsystem is inspected daily by the water treatment plant operating\npersonnel.  The facility is manned 24 hours per day.\n\nC.    In general, the Connellsville Treatment FacilityA?s accidental\nrelease prevention program is based on the following:\n\n    - Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n    - Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n    - Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n      conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n    - Implementation of employee training program\n    - Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n      and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Municipal Authority\nof Westmoreland County will perform a compliance audit at least once\nevery 3 years.  The compliance audit will include a review of all\naspects of the ris"

Written documentation of the audit\nwill be maintained on-site.\n\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic\nrelease of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A summary of the\ninvestigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained\nat the treatment facility.\n\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the\nappropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection\ndevice, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and a ton-cylinder repair\nkit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees\nrelative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine gas.\n\nD.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility\nin the past five years.\n\nE.    The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning\nCommittee (LEPC) of Westmoreland CountyA?s written emergency response\nplan.  Release response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation\nprocedures and training exercises are included within the plan.  The\npublic is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as\nsoon as a release occurs.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by\nthe facility emergency coordinator.\n\nThe Connellsville Water Treatment Plant employees will not respond to\naccidental releases of chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include\nthe local fire department, police department, emergency medical service\nand HAZMAT team.\n\nF.    There are no actions planned to improve safety regarding the\nchlorine system at this time."
