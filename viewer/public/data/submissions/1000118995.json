This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as; design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Such releases are not foreseeable however, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response personnel at McAllen Fire Department who will control and mitigate the effects of any releases.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled at our facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  100% of the ammonia inventory is used as a refrigerant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
