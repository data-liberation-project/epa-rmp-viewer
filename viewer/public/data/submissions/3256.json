Facility Policy\n\n              The owners, management, and employees of Country Spring Farmers Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release  should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  Bloomville Fire Department or other local and federal authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n              The primary activity in the spring at the Bloomville Branch is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n              Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n              The maximum quantity stored would be 74,600 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handle 74,600.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release.\n\n               a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 74,600 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .91 mile.\n\n               b. The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\n                The facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. Five year accident history\n\n                 a. There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. The emergency respo"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n                  Safety is an on-going process at Country Spring Farmers Co-op. Periodic evaluations are preformed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
