As part of this commitment, BP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at BP and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a summary of the risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at BP.  This plan summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 though 40 CFR 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management plan in place at BP.\n\n2.0   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBP is committed to the welfare of their employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment.  BP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, BP will conduct emergency response actions to help prevent or minimize injury to the public and the environment.\n\n3.0   Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nBP manufactures polypropylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as plastic bottles, chip bags, children's toys, and car parts.\n  \nThe manufacturing process uses propylene as the basic building block for producing polypropylene.  Titanium tetrachloride is used as a catalyst for the polypropylene reaction.  Propane is inherent to polypropylene processes.  \n\n4.0   Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the polypropylene facility.  The subject analysis consisted of worst-case scenario(s) and alternati"

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled at BP.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n5.2   Hazard Review \nBP performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists include items to help ensure that BP operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n5.3   Operating Procedures \nBP maintains it's operating procedures under an ISO9000 program.  As such we are required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n5.4   Training \nBP trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n5.5   Maintenance \nBP properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n5.6   Management of Change \nBP has a program in place to document changes to the process.

The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any significant changes.\n\n5.7   Pre-startup Review \nBP performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is done prior to operating.  The review (1) confirms proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a hazard evaluation has been conducted, and (4) training has been updated.\n\n5.8   Compliance Audits\nBP performs periodic compliance audits of the covered process to verify that the process is operating in compliance with the Process Safety Management standard.  Compliance audit reports are prepared after each audit, with documented deficiencies and corrections.\n\n5.9   Incident Investigations\nBP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  BP procedures require an investigation team to be assembled, and the investigation to be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n5.10   Employee Participation\nBP requires participation by the affected employees in development (1) of the process hazard evaluation, (2) process safety management, and (3) operating procedures of all covered processes.  The employees that work with or maintain the processes are given access to all information required under the rule.\n\n5.11   Hot Work Permits\nBP has written safety practices in place for fire protection and process operation.  A permitting system is used to prevent any unsafe acts on or around the covered process.\n\n5.12   Contractors\nBP reviews all contractors prior to working on or near a covered proces"

The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place.  Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood.  In addition, BP has procedures in place, which require the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to be controlled.\n\n5.13   Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to engineering review and hazard analyses previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving RMP listed compounds receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures developed by BP.  In addition, several equipment safeguards are in place.  Examples of such safeguards include: hydrocarbon detection and water deluge systems, related piping and vessel periodic inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring for operations involving RMP listed compounds.\n  \n6.0   Five-Year Accident History\nBP maintains a 5-year accident history that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule (\u00a768.42).  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention.  No releases of regulated substances have occurred from BP during the subject five year period that resulted in consequences of interest (i.e., deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site).\n\n7.0 Emergency Response Program\nBP has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel, and the company provides appropriate information to the fire chief.
