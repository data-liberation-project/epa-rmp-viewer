The OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, and process hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantity specified. The procedures address all aspects of facility activities, including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, safe work practices, incident investigation, audits, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process which could result in accidents.\n\nThe prevention program consists of many elements and policies, which are briefly outlined below.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: Employees participate in all aspects of the program, and are provided with the information developed in the program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION: All necessary process information and records are maintained in several convenient locations, including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS: Contract employees, with extensive professional training in the methods of process hazard analysis (PHA), are retained to act as PHA team leaders and work in conjunction with the Terminal employees. These reviews are updated on a regular basis.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES: Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of the operation, including emergency operation and shutdown.\n\nOPERATIONS TRAINING: All operators receive initial training in the process and its operating procedures and are supervised by an experienced operator for a lengthy training period before being allowed to control the process on their own.

Contractors are also required to have had recent site-specific training from the facility.  Periodic evaluations are made to assure that work is completed in a safe manner.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW: A safety review is conducted on any new process equipment or any significant modification of the process.  This assures that construction and equipment installed are in accordance with design, that all necessary procedures, including safety procedures, are in place, that necessary training is completed, and that hazard analysis or other requirements of management of change are completed.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY: This is a quality assurance procedure to assure that equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended. Maintenance employees are trained in process hazards and safety procedures applicable to their work. Inspections, procedures, and testing are conducted under this part of the program.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES: Procedures and policies for all work permits and maintenance lockout/tagout procedures are in force, and are periodically reviewed for completeness and effectiveness.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: No changes in the process or procedures are allowed without a review and authorization. Safety impacts, technical review, required procedure modifications, and training needed are all considered in this review.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION: A facility team promptly investigates any accident, near miss, or incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, an ammonia release.

Under these criteria, there has been one release incident  (April 1, 2002) in the facility's last five years.  This incident is reported in Section 6 of this submission and is summarized below.\n\n* April 1, 2002 at 1:45 p.m., duration of 5 minutes, an ammonia vapor release from the 33K Storage Tank vacuum/vent valve, caused by warm ammonia from a discharging vessel creating a tank pressure spike and with human error contributing (poor communication with ship), estimated release of 1,300 pounds, resulted in no deaths, 16 first aid cases off-site, no property or environmental damage, but required about 300 off-site personnel to shelter in place briefly.\n\nWe also note that in 2003, we reported three very minor ammonia releases that were not reportable, but gave the appropriate warning to our neighbors of the releases.  In all three of these cases, our neighbors sheltered in place when our warning siren was sounded.\n\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances. The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site. This is called the worst case toxic release scenario (worst case scenario) and involves the release of 32,250 tons of ammonia. This release must be considered to occur over a 10- minute period and pooling of the ammonia can be considered when modeling this release.  EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP version 1.07 was used to determine the maximum downwind distance the ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "release could impact the general public.  This assessment incorporated a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (Ammonia concentration) of 0.14 mg/L.  This toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L refers to the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\n\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted. The alternate case chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 96,000 pounds would be released over a 2-minute period. A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards have been installed and operator intervention will tend to mitigate and limit the quantity in such cases. The same modeling techniques were applied and resulted in much lesser off-site impact.  Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release will cause off-site impacts.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP version 1.07, was also used to perform the off-site consequence analysis.  The ammonia toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L was used in the assessment.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS: \n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the Terminal.  The Prevention Program of the Process Safety Management Program facilitates this process.  Many process safeguards have been implemented as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis and the Incident Investigation activities.  The increased emphasis on security measures since September 11, 2001 has also been instrumental in many improvements, such as an expanded video surveillance system, improved fencing, all electronically controlled gates, intruder alarms, crash barriers, and greatly enhanced lighting.  Among the many improvements currently scheduled for this facility within the next year or two are even more se"
