      "SummaryText": "The Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Sparland, IL Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Sparland, IL Facility located approximately 2.5 miles west of Sparland, IL at the intersection of Highways 7 and 17.  The physical address to the Facility is 746 Yankee Lane, Sparland, IL 61565.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Sparland, IL Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Sparland, IL Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this to reflect the change in RMP Implementation Manager and Emergency Contact Information.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Sparland, IL Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferred to two (2) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous "

This Facility owns and operates (36) 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage and Handling.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30-second release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (emergency shutoff valves and excess flow valves on the commercial tanker truck, and bulkhead, piping support, air actuated emergency shutoff valves, back flow check valve and air actuated internal safety valves at the storage tanks) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed"

The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Sparland, IL Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Sparland, IL Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Sparland, IL Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Sparland, IL Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Marshall County LEPC and the Sparland & Lacon Volunteer Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Sparland, IL Facility.\n\n"
