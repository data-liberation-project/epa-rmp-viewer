The facility is also committed to providing its' employees with the skills necessary to safely handle the chemicals used at the site.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia tank and associated piping are visually inspected and maintained to ensure the tank and its' components are in good condition and they do not develop defects which could compromise the tanks integrity.  The tank contains a manual shut-off valve which will stop the flow out of the piping if a rupture in any of the connected hosing should develop.  The anhydrous tank is also equipped with automatic valves which will shut off the flow if a pipe break were to occur.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with break away piping shich will prevent damage to the tank and loss of substantial product if a transfer tank is not disconnected prior to  moving away from the loading area.  The applicator tanks for the anhydrous operations are also inspected regularly and maintained to prevent releases.                                                              \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nRothsay Farmers Coop has processes present at the Barnesville site location for anhydrous ammonia which require the facility to comploete a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nThe facility contains anhydrous ammonia for resale.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000 gallo n tank at the facility.  Facility personnel are responsible for transferring the anhydrous ammonia to transfer tanks which are used in conjunction with injection equipment to inject the product into the ground for use as a fertilizer.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia stored and handled on the site would be a tank rupture releasing 140,000 pounds of anh"

The EPA's RMP comp program was used to determine the worst case scenario impacts.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen for the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling was a pipe leak for two minutes from the tank resulting an a smaller release of anhydrous ammonia and vaporization.  The alternative release scenario would have an impact extending to approximately 0.83 miles from the pipe leak.  An EPA reference table was used to determine this alternative release scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Sprevention Steps:\n\nThe facility complies withOSHA (29CFR 1910.111) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release our first steps will include, calling 911 which will in turn notify the local fire department.  The processes utilized to prevent injuries from the release will be to evacuate residences downwind of the release which could be limpacted by the anhydros ammonia vapors.  The fire department will utilize water to  minimize the amount of vaporization.  Water is also the first  means of first aid for persons that come into contact with the anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe site has not had a release of anhydrous ammonia within the last five years which resulted in any injury to site personnel or to surrounding residences.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nAll of the sites emergency procedures are conducted with the local volunteer fire department.  In case of an Accident at the sitel, The local fire department would be called upon for assistance.  The facility personnel are trained in the proper handling of the anhydrous equipment and in basic first aid procedures in case of contadt with the anhydrous ammonial.  Water tanks for utilizing in case of accidental contact with anhydrous ammonia are present on all of the transfer tanks.\n\nP"
