BASF Performance Co-Polymners  and its response partner, Degussa-Huls have a long standing commitiment to public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe BASF Perfromance Co-Polymners/Degussa-H\u00fcls has a nine-point policy guiding the accidental release prevention program. These are:\n\n1) Use applicable design safety codes and standards as the basis for design, construction, operation, and maintenance in our facilities.\n2) Evaluate facilities, equipment and processes for safety and health concerns.\n3) Use multiple safeguards to provide layers of protection in the design, construction and operation of facilities to prevent a single failure escalating into a catastrophic event.\n4) Document the safety and health evaluation.\n5) Inspect and evaluate process equipment against the design specifications.\n6) Maintain current and complete documentation of the process and equipment throughout the lifetime of the process.\n7) Develop a Management of Change procedure to control minor changes to process technology, operation and maintenance that may affect the safety of the process.\n8) Review all changes to process equipment, procedures and practices to ensure the continued safety of employees and facilities.\n9) Develop inspection and maintenance programs that ensure the continued integrity of facilities.\n\n\nBASF Perfromance Co-Polymers/Degussa-H\u00fcls has a nine-point policy guiding the emergency response program.

This facility employs 120 personnel.  Two primary production areas produce trioxane monomer and polyoxymethylene in a continuous production schedule, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:  formaldehyde and methyl formate.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 50,000 pounds of formaldehyde over a 10-minute period f"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. According to EPA's look-up tables, the release would not reach offsite endpoints such as public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 110,000 pounds of methyl formate over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud which subsequently ignites. Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the methyl formate storage tank from containing over this amount. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. According to EPA's look-up tables, the 1 psi overpressure boundary from the expansion would not reach offsite and would not reach any public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe ARS for formaldehyde is \u00bc\" hole at the storage tank outlet valve at operating pressure and 75 \u00b0C. The hole results from a partial gasket failure or line damage resulting in a release of 300 pounds of gas over a 15-minute period.  The 15-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak, depressurize the line and transfer the spilled material into containment.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.

The standard includes management systems elements involving safety information, hazard evaluations, operating procedures, employee training, contractor programs, mechanical integrity, pre-start up safety reviews, incident investigations, safe work practices and emergency response.\n\nThere are a number of chemical specific prevention steps used at the facility including release detection equipment, release containment, and release control equipment.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBASF Perfromance Co-Polymers has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. We have no incidents in the last five years that meet the RMP reporting requirements.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nBASF Perfromance Co-Polymers maintains a written emergency response program. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid, medical treatment, evacuation plans, and notification of local emergency response.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Degussa-H\u00fcls is coordinated with the Mobile Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Degussa-H\u00fcls conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBASF Perfromance Co-Polymers resolves all findings from process hazards analysis, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned: increase process controls & update procedures."
