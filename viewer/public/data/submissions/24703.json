That expansion should be completed in 2003.  This facility is committed to accident prevention and protection of employees and the public.  \n\nThe plant utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  Chlorine is maintained at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present on-site and any one time is 4,000 pounds which is in excess of the Risk Management Planning threshold of 1,500 pounds.  Sulfur dioxide is also maintained at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide present at any one time is 4,000 pounds, which is below the Risk Management Planning threshold of 5,000 pounds.  \n\nThe City of Katy Plant was constructed in 1979 and has never had an accidental release of a toxic chemical.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\nAccidental releases of chlorine are prevented through the use of standardized procedures recommended by the manufacturer.  Only the chlorine supplier will install or remove chlorine cylinders at the facility.  Plant personnel have been trained in procedures regarding the use of chlorine.  The chlorine system operates under a vacuum to minimize the potential for release.  \n\nEmergency response policies are discussed below under the section entitled Emergency Response Plan.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case and alternate scenarios utilized the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants to model the distance to the toxic end point.  The worst-case scenario for chlorine is an urban setting, 1.3 miles to the toxic end point and affecting approximately 1,000 residents. The alternate scenario for chlorine is 0.4 miles to the toxic end point affecting approximately 100 residents.\n\nGeneral Acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Safety Hazard Analysis was conducted in September 2001 using the what-if and checklist methodologies.  The Plant chlorine system utilizes numerous engineering and administrative safeguards including vacuum design to minimize release potential, use of continuous gas detectors to provide early warning of a release, operating procedures for the system, preventative maintenance procedures, personnel training and use of personal protective equipment.  \n\nTo maintain compliance with the Process Safety Management Standard, the plant operator will certify that training has been provided to personnel operating the chlorine system and the sulfur dioxide system.  Also, refresher training will be conducted at a minimum of yearly.  That training will cover the areas of process safety information, operating procedures and emergency procedures.  Training records will be maintained. \n\nOutside contractors will be provided all necessary training prior to starting work.  That training will inform the contractors of the use of toxic compounds on site and the potential for hazardous release.  That training will also inform the contractors of their responsibility while on site.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant has had no accidental releases of either chlorine of sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR 68 pertaining to notification, medical treatment, response procedures, planning, use and maintenance of emergency equipment, employee safety training and emergency response evaluation dealing with chlorine gas.   After discovery of a leak, the Operator and one other person will make an assessment of the situation.   If the assessment indicates that repair by Plant personnel is possible, the Plant personnel will perform the needed repairs.  If the assessment indicates that a major leak has occurred, the Plant's Em"

All communication with other response agencies and any notification to the public will be coordinated through the City of Katy Police Department.  Plant personnel are trained in the Emergency Response Plan at least annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn addition to chlorine and sulfur dioxide monitors presently in place in processing areas, continuous monitors will be installed adjacent to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas.  Those monitors will be equipped with alarms to notify appropriate personnel and/or off-site responders of any release while the event is still minor in nature.  It is anticipated that the monitors will be in place by February 1, 2002."
