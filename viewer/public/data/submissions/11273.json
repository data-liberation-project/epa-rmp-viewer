The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activities of the Synfuels Plant encompass the manufacture of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and other by-products from lignite coal using Lurgi gasification technology.  The SNG production rate is approximately 170 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  The Synfuels Plant also generates, sells, and ships a number of other products, including anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe substances present at the Synfuels Plant in quantities above applicable thresholds and regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP), Section 112(r), of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 are ammonia and flammable-gas mixtures containing various concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen.  The maximum inventories of Section 112(r) substances at the Synfuels Plant are approximately 65.6 million pounds of ammonia and approximately 150 thousand pounds of flammable-gas mixture.\n\nThe ammonia is used for sales as a fertilizer, in the refrigeration systems, and in the production of ammonium sulfate. The flammable gas mixtures are used in the manufacturing of SNG as well as the gas feed for the ammonia production facility.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe hazard assessment for the Synfuels Plant included computer analyses of potential releases from nine flammable-gas mixture process areas and three ammonia process areas to estimate the potential distance to explosion endpoints and toxic endpoints, respectively.  Two of the Synfuels Plant process areas include both flammable-gas mixtures and ammonia, for a total of ten process areas analyzed.  The impact analysis computer software refined modeling programs Degadis and SLAB, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP*Comp software, which employs equations"

The worst-case endpoints resulted in a pressure wave capable of shattering windows and causing possible related injuries.  The worst-case scenario considered for this process involves a flammable-gas mixture, namely methane.  The quantity released in the worst of the nine simulated scenarios was assumed to be 20,500 pounds from Gas Compression (1900), which classifies as a Program 1 process.  It was assumed that the entire quantity would be released as a vapor which finds an ignition source with a yield factor of ten percent of the available energy released in the vapor cloud explosion to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of one pound per square inch (PSI) overpressure is 0.22 miles.  The computer simulations predicted that explosions from flammable-gas mixtures would not occur off-site, resulting in no risk to the public from fire and explosion.\n\nThe development of potential impacts from ammonia handling areas, Ammonia Storage and Loading (6000), Ammonia Production (4400), and Ammonia Refrigeration in Rectisol (1400), included the computer simulation of potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the three Synfuels Plant ammonia handling areas.  The Section 112(r) toxic endpoint for ammonia is the ERPG-2 one-hour exposure limit of 200 parts per million.  An ERPG-2 value is the maximum concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe worst-case"

Passive mitigation controls involving a dike around a 60 million pound refrigerated storage tank were taken into account to calculate the worst-case impact from that source.  The mitigated release rate from the analysis of the refrigerated storage tank was estimated at 20,512 pounds per minute.  The diked area around the refrigerated tank was estimated to release approximately 1.23 million pounds over one hour, the toxic endpoint threshold exposure time.  As a result of accounting for the 200,708 square foot diked area around the large refrigerated storage tank, the simulated release from this 60 million pound tank was determined not to represent the worst-case impact.  The worst-case toxic endpoint distance was determined to occur with an ammonia release from a smaller pressurized tank.\n\nThe predicted worst-case impact was from the simulation of an unmitigated release of the entire contents of a one million gallon pressurized ammonia tank.  The release from the pressurized tank was required to be simulated as a ten-minute release of the entire contents, which resulted in a release rate of 545,540 pounds per minute and the total release of approximately 5.46 million pounds of ammonia.  The worst-case scenario was simulated at a required Class F atmospheric stability, or very stable, and a 1.5 meters per second wind speed.  Simulated worst-case ammonia releases were predicted, using the Degadis refined computer modeling program to have toxic endpoint impacts out to 4.5 miles from the plant site release point.  Such a catastrophic release is extremely unlikely if even possible.\n\nDGC was also required to perform a computer simulation of a more realistic alternative ammonia release since the worst-case ammonia impact extended off-site.

The alternative scenario resulting in the maximum toxic endpoint distance involved the simulation of overpressurizing the same 1,000,000 gallon tank used in the worst-case analysis and the subsequent release of ammonia through pressure release valves.  The alternative scenario was simulated to occur at a continuous release rate of 2,045 pounds per minute with a total release of 122,700 pounds of ammonia over one hour.  The alternative release was simulated with an average site wind speed of 5.3 meters per second and a corresponding typical atmospheric stability of Class D, or neutral.  The predicted maximum distance using the SLAB computer program and the more realistic alternative release to the ammonia toxic endpoint was 1.5 miles.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with appropriate training in performing these job tasks.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by inspection checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner or parameter limits are implemented to safely operate the equipment until the deficiency has been corrected.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Synfuels Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are informed and trained on any modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new facilities or significant modification in covered process areas are conducted at the Synfuels Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.  These reviews also address appropriate safety, operations, maintenance, and emergency response procedures, if applicable, are in place and adequate as well as employees trained in operating the process.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Synfuels Plant conducts procedural compliance and regulatory compliance audits every three (3) years to determine whether the provisions set out under applicable health and safety requirements, which will include the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule, CAAA Section 112(r), are being implemented.  The corrective actions required as a result of audit deficiencies are monitored to ensure implementation.\n\nIncident"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a miminum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Synfuels Plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, plant employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP Rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, DGC hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Synfuels Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Synfuels Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years, reflecting the good safety at the facility.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only four reportable accidental releases as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred in the last five years.  The four accidents were relatively small, and none of them resulted in off-site impacts.  Since there was not an off-site impact, the Emergency Response Program for off-site notification was not required or invoked.\n\n6.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including response to and mitigation for fires, explosion, hazardous and gas releases; adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuations; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nPotential off-site impacts are addressed through an in-place emergency response plan developed in conjunction with the PSM and DGC health, safety, and environmental policies.  In case of an off-site release, the emergency response plan directs DGC Protection Services to notify Basin Electric Headquarters Security, which in turn will notify according to the following priority list:\n\n1.  Residents and Businesses\n2.  Mercer County Sheriff's Office\n3.  North Dakota State Emergency Commission\n4.  National Response Center\n5.  On-call DGC Environmental Department Representatives\n\nThe current emergency response plan calls for Basin Electric Headquarters Security to notify residents and businesses downwind of the Synfuels Plant to a distance of 2.5 miles.  The Mercer County Disaster Emergency Services is also notified, and they are responsible for notifying residents and businesses beyond 2.5 miles downwind from the Synfuels Plant.  In case of an accidental release with potential off-site releases, the public will be instructed to either shelter-in-place or evacuate.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our on-site emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\n\n7.
