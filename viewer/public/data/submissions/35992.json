Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 16,600 pounds (i.e., 3,300 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 5,700 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 3,200 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Norman plant is located in an urban setting.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration at the Norman plant is a two-stage system consisting of a high (pressure) side and a low (pressure) side.\n\n\n\nThe storage freezers operate on the low side (low pressure and, therefore, low temperature).  Ammonia suction from the units, at about 0 psig, is transferred directly to the booster compressors.  The booster disc"

      "SummaryText": "harge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors.\n\n\n\nThe high stage compressor suction draws from the intercooler (booster discharge) and the high side suction accumulator for the new milk cooler at about 25 psig.  The accumulator receives suction from the flooded system for the new milk cooler load units.\n\n\n\nDischarge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to four roof-mounted condensors.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrost of various load units.\n\n\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to either the high side load units or to the low pressure liquid accumulator.  The liquid passes through a liquid cooler before entering the low pressure liquid recirculator.\n\n\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.\n\n\n\nSafety relief valves (SRVs) protect the compressor discharge, condensors, suction accumulators, and intercooler.  SRVs on the compressor discharge and condensors are set a 250 psig.  SRVs for the suction vessels are set at 150 psig.\n\n\n\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats and/or sensors for the vessels.  If a discharge pressure of 180 psig is reached in the system, an alarm sounds.  If the pressure continues to rise to 210 psig, the compressors and boosters are shut down.  If the intermediate pressure increases to 30 psig, an alarm also sounds.  If the pressure continues to rise to 40 psig, the boosters are shut down.\n\n\n\nFloat switches on the suction vessels alarm when a high level is reached.  If the liquid level continues to rise, additional float switches and/or level control shut off the appropriate compressors or boosters to avoid slugging.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration s"

      "SummaryText": "ystems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact.  Moreover, a release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n\n\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\n\n\n\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\n\n\n\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\n\n\n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia"

A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.

The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n\n\n5.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe prevention program that is described in Section 2.0 of this Executive \n\nSummary is a management system that is designed to proactively identify, \n\nevaluate, and reduce the potential for a ammonia release and/or a release's \n\nimpact or consequence, due to failures in process, procedures, and \n\nequipment.
