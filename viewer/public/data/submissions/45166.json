      "SummaryText": "Source\n\nTitanium sponge is the principle product of Wah Chang?s facility located at 530 34th Avenue in Albany, Oregon.  Titanium sponge is produced by reacting titanium tetrachloride TiCl4 with magnesium metal to produce titanium metal sponge and magnesium chloride.  The titanium sponge is further processed into various alloys and a number of different shapes.  \n\nTiCl4 is the only toxic chemical regulated by the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Titanium Sponge Production facility.  TiCl4 is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  It is Wah Chang?s policy to manage hazardous chemicals and processes ?using the highest standards for the protection of our people, our customers, the community, and the environment in order to ensure a safe, productive and competitive facility?.\n\nRegulated Chemicals\n\nThe Wah Chang Titanium Sponge Production facility uses titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a raw material in the titanium metal manufacturing process.  TiCl4, a liquid at ambient temperatures, is delivered in rail cars containing approximately 16,000 gallons and unloaded into storage tanks ranging in size from 10,000 to 21,700 gallons.  The storage tanks are surrounded with concrete dikes designed to contain any accidental leaks or spills from the storage system into a large below-ground containment sump.  From the storage area, the TiCl4 is pumped to the sponge plant where it is reduced to titanium metal.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, the TiCl4 would be collected in the containment system or flow onto the ground and slowly evaporate.  The TiCl4 vapors would react with the humidity in the air to form titanium dioxide, an inert nonhazardous solid, and hydrochloric acid (HCl).  The health effect of HCl vapor is primarily an irritant of mucous membranes, the eyes, and the respiratory tract.  The HCl vapors would migrate downwind and quickly disperse to below health affect concentrations.\n\n\n\nAccident"

      "SummaryText": "al Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe toxicity of TiCl4 at high concentrations makes it necessary for Wah Chang to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is Wah Chang?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle toxic chemicals including equipment design and safe handling procedures used to operate the equipment.  Wah Chang?s release prevention program is based on four principles; inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and the goal of continuous improvement.  Our chemical storage and handling equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards as well as incorporating good engineering practices recommended by industry groups.  As a result, Wah Chang?s equipment incorporates inherently safe designs.  Written operating and maintenance procedures are prepared and reviewed annually for accuracy and safety.  Operating and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards, and are provided with regular refresher training.  Equipment and procedures are frequently evaluated and updated with the goal of continuous improvement in both operation and safety.\n\nWah Chang?s emergency response program integrates OSHA?s and EPA?s preparedness planning response and training requirements.  In the event of an accidental release, the emergency response plan includes notifying 911 dispatch, who will notify local responders.  Plant personnel will notify neighboring industries, DEQ, and OSHA, as necessary.  Plant personnel receive classroom training on implementation of the response plan in addition to participating in training exercises."
