Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Southeast Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 6 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Chlorine, Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Formaldehyde (solution), Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  \n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 1 substances is a releae of 3000 pounds of Formaldehyde 37% which obtaines a maximum endpont of 4.2 miles. The worst case sceniaro for program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Hydroxide.  In this scenario 17397 lb. of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over  minutes.   At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.8 mil"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Sulfur Dioxide storage.
