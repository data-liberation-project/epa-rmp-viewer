This water treatment plant in owened by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) wich is a Government Agency. PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program 3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance chlorine for water disinfection. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention\r\n\r\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requierments. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Guayama Regional Sewage Tratment Plant is observing the appropriate engineering controls. Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and inmediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Guayama Wastewater Treatment Plant is located close to the area where the plant discharges the treated water. The chlorine is used as disinfectant to destroy the microrganism that could cause illness and contamination.Chlorine is delivered from PRASA's Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) tone containers. The containers are connected to chlorinators the chlorine flows to the vaccum dosificator and from it the chlorine is sent to the contact chamber, through a underground pipeline, where it is combined with the used water at the end of plant's process.\r\n\r\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Mangement Program Guidance for Wastewat"

In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.2 miles.\r\n \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenace and mechanical integrity of the facility wich will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention requirements plans. Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine. List all SOP'S are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported during the last five years.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPRASA has implemented in Guayama Regional Sewage Treatment Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine  handling and storage. \r\n\r\nAudits\r\n\r\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on december 18, 2012.
