      "SummaryText": "The Biddeford Saco Division of the Maine Water Company is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. This commitment is documented in the facility's accident prevention and emergency response plans, which are available to all employees.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to provide safe drinking water to the communities of Biddeford, Saco, Old Orchard Beach, and Pine Point. Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, is used for disinfection. Chlorine is delivered to the facility by truck in one-ton cylinders in 100 percent concentration. Fusible plugs are located at the end of each cylinder to prevent rupture and explosion. A new monorail was installed so that cylinder receiving, cylinder storage, and cylinder scales could all be serviced using a new traveling hoist. The delivery truck pulls up alongside the building where the monorail hoist lifts the cylinder off the truck for immediate storage into the chlorine storage room. The monorail extends approximately five feet outside the building. Therefore, initial unloading of the chlorine cylinders takes place outside the building. Three chlorine cylinders are delivered at one time. The maximum amount of chlorine present onsite at any one time would be approximately 9,800 pounds. Four cylinders would be full and a fifth cylinder could contain as much as 1,800 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe facility operates a vacuum chlorine process, in which chlorine is drawn from a one-ton cylinder under vacuum and delivered to the chlorinators (3) for introduction into two chlorine solution lines and the treatment process. The chlorine feed system will only operate under vacuum. Loss of vacuum at any point beyond the vacuum regulator (mounted on the cylinder manifold valve) will stop the discharge of chlorine gas.

      "SummaryText": "y. This room, where all chlorine cylinders are stored and the chlorinators are located, is equipped with a chlorine leak detection sensor. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with fusible plugs, as indicated above, and the chlorinators are equipped with pressure relief valves. A large viewing window allows equipment in the room (or emergency responders) to be monitored from outside. From the chlorinators, chlorine is delivered in a less concentrated chlorine solution to various feed points at the treatment station. Two chlorine solution lines are used regularly, the Top of Filter and the Clearwell application lines. The two chlorine solution lines are painted safety red, and the contents of each solution line are labeled at four-foot intervals. A Chlorine Institute Repair Kit B is maintained at the Pumping Station. The kit includes materials to contain any leaking manifold valves or defective chlorine cylinders. \n\n \n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's process safety management regulation and with the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, as well as applicable state and local regulations. \n\n\n\nThere has never been an accident involving chlorine at the facility that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of chlorine on employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has a trained emergency response team, appropriate equipment and supplies, and a detailed emergency preparedness plan. In the event of a chlorine release of 10 pounds or more or a release which could potentially extend beyond the facility's boundaries, it is the company's policy to notify agencies as required by SARA regulations which would include the emergency response agency, the State Police, the fire department, and the Maine Drinking Water Program and Public Utilities Commission."
