As part of this commitment, the Jesup mill has established and maintained health, environmental protection, and safety systems to help ensure safe operation of their processes. One component of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP).  This RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management programs (the RMP rule). The RMP rule requires regulated facilities to submit a risk management plan describing their risk management program. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that the Jesup pulp mill has developed and implemented.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill is a three-mill, Kraft pulping complex involved in the manufacture of bleached dissolving pulp. As part of this manufacturing process, we handle two regulated substances above the threshold quantities and are covered by the RMP rule. The RMP-covered processes, chlorine dioxide and sulfur dioxide are Program Level 3 processes. \r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide are used as pulp bleaching chemicals in our process. They are added directly to the pulp as dilute water solutions in carefully controlled bleach stages. Chlorine Dioxide is used in all three mills. Sulfur Dioxide is added directly to the pulp as a dilute water solution and is used to control or stop chlorine dioxide reactions in pulp.  It is used in all three mills.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\nThe Rayonier Performance Fibers Jesup Mill has developed an accidental release prevention program for all process chemicals covered by the respective OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations. These programs are modeled after, and comply with, the requisite elements of the OSHA PSM"

The EPA RMP rule established that for Program Level 3 processes, OSHA's PSM prevention program could be used to satisfy RMP prevention requirements provided that it was updated to reflect accidental releases with potential off-site impact. This update was accomplished for our three RMP covered processes, and the following is a brief description of the key elements of our OSHA PSM prevention program. \r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION. A variety of technical documents are maintained and used to help ensure safe operation of the Jesup mill processes. Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Jesup mill. Engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration for the equipment in each covered process. The Jesup mill ensures that this process safety information is up to date and available to all mill employees.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS. The Jesup mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) for each covered process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to perform these PHA's. PHA teams at the Jesup mill use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented by checklists, to perform the hazard analyses. A written summary report that contains recommendations for mill management review is prepared by the team. Mill management assigns responsibility for resolution of each recommendation.  Where appropriate, changes to improve the safety of the process are implemented. PHA's are performed on each covered process at least once every five years.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES. Jesup mill operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures for all covered processes. These procedures describe how operations should be safely performed under conditions of initial sta"

Operating procedures are used both as operating guidelines and training tools. They are annually certified to be current and accurate by mill Management.  All operating procedures for covered systems reside on a computer based training network (SkillsNow) and are accessible 24/7 by all employees via the mill's intranet. \r\n\r\nTRAINING. Jesup mill training focuses on general process descriptions, a review of the properties and hazards of the process chemicals and detailed process operating procedures and safe work practices.  This is accomplished using computer based training tool (SkillsNow) for all covered processes.  Modules have been developed for each covered process and include skills testing and testing record keeping. CBT is augmented with classroom and on-the--job training. Refresher training is conducted at least once every three years.  All Training modules for covered systems residing in SkillsNow are accessible 24/7 by all employees via the mill's intranet. \r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY. The Jesup mill employs a mechanical integrity program to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment. The program applies to all covered processes and includes equipment inspection and testing specifications, replacement parts and equipment specifications, procedures for inspection, testing and maintaining equipment, training of maintenance personnel, and documentation of maintenance activities.  The mill currently utilizes an electronic management system to schedule and notify maintenance supervision of equipment tests and inspections as well as maintain an equipment history.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE. The Jesup mill management of change procedure requires evaluation and approval of all changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes. These procedu"

Central to this process is the updating of process information relating to the change and communication of the change to employees involved in the covered process.  The Jesup MOC system utilizes an electronic issuance and tracking system which includes notifications for approvers and MOC coordinators of required review and action items to be addressed.  Our computer based training system is also equipped with an MOC function to notify affected employees of all changes to operating procedures resulting from a PSM MOC.\r\n \r\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW. The Jesup mill performs a pre-startup safety review on all covered process changes significant enough to require updating of the process safety information.  A pre-startup review team completes a checklist to document the review and to ensure that identified safety issues have been addressed.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS. Process safety compliance audits are an integral part of the Jesup mill prevention program. Audits are performed by an audit team knowledgeable in the process and process safety management. The audit team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the PSM/RMP rule and is sufficient to help ensure the safe operation of the process. Audit results are documented, recommendations resolved and appropriate improvements to the prevention program are implemented.  Audit findings are included in the mill's Consolidated Action Plan, which receives corporate executive review.  The Jesup mill audits the prevention program using either an internal or external audit at least once every three years.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION. The Jesup mill investigates all incidents that result or could potentially result in injury to mill personnel or the public, or could harm the environment.

Those responsible for conducting the investigation as well as those assigned corrective actions from the investigation are notified via internal e-mail of required completion activities.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION. Employee participation is a key element of the Jesup mill prevention program. This participation ensures that employee concerns relative to the safety of the covered processes are fully addressed. Employees participate in PHA's, incident investigations, procedures development and compliance audits.\r\n\r\nHOT WORK PERMITS. The Jesup mill has developed hot work procedures to control spark or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in the mill covered processes.  The mill's Hot Work Permitting process is part of an overarching Safe Work Permitting program including other Safe Work Practices such as Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, and Line Breaking.  Training on hot work permitting and other Safe Work Practices is conducted annually.\r\n   \r\nCONTRACTORS. Contractor safety is included in the Jesup mill prevention program. The Jesup mill reviews the safety records of all contractors to help ensure that they can safely perform the desired job tasks. As with mill employees, contractors are informed of the hazards of the processes they will work on, the Jesup mill emergency response procedures and the mill safe work practices. Contractors are required to provide the Jesup mill with training records and work performance is periodically reviewed to ensure that safe work practices are being followed.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
