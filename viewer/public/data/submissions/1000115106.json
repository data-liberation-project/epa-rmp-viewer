CCS Division\nFitchburg, MA Facility\nRisk Management Plan\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\nThis plan was prepared as part of the Risk Management Program (RMP) of the Fitchburg, MA facility of Synthomer Inc. The RMP conforms to the legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of the RMP is to:\n\n1, Describe existing safety systems at the Fitchburg Plant designed to protect employees, the community, the environment, and the production facility.\n2, Share information with the Fitchburg community about plant operations, including steps taken to minimize risk from the handling of regulated substances.\n3, Comply with the applicable EPA regulations; 40 CFR Part 68 Section 112(r).\n\nThe following summary presents an overview of the Fitchburg facility accident prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY:\n\n\nAt Synthomer Safety, Health, Environment & Security (SHE&S) is a Core Value. As part of the Synthomer organization we embrace the Synthomer Core Values, SHE Principles and Golden Rules. Synthomer has introduced SHE Principles and Ten (10) Golden Rules across all sites to directly target and improve the safe operation of our plants. The SHE Principles are:\n\n1) Look after yourself\n2) Look after each other\n3) Effective last line of defense (PPE)\n4)  Stop & Think\n5) Safe workplace\n6) Safe vehicle, safe driver\n7) Safe process and operations\n8) Safe systems of work\n9) No change without assessment (MOC)\n10) Learning from our mistakes\n\nAs a member of the American Chemistry Council, Synthomer embraces the principles of Responsible Care, the chemical industry's commitment to continual improvement of health, occupational, process and product safety and environmental performance. We manage all aspects of our activities so that we provide high levels of protection for employees, customers, the public and other stakeholders as well as the environment.   \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATED PROCESS:\n\nThe Fitchburg facility p"

The finished products are non-hazardous white latex liquids. Synthomer Inc. Fitchburg, MA facility processes one material subject to EPA risk management planning: Acrylonitrile. This material is stored in a state-of-the-art underground tank system commissioned in December 1998. A third party inspection of this tank was last completed in December of 2017 with no deficiencies found. Acrylonitrile is a hydrocarbon raw material used to make acrylate polymers. This manufacturing process, called \"emulsion polymerization\" combines and reacts the acrylonitrile with other materials in water to form a different non-toxic chemical structure, which is sold as a product to customers in various industries.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to provide information about all accidents involving specified hazardous substances over the past five years. Accidents resulting in (1) death or serious injury as defined by the RMP regulation, or, (2) significant property damage on-site, or, (3) known deaths, injuries , property or environmental damage off-site. \n\nNo accidents have occurred over the last 5 years at the Fitchburg facility as described above.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\nIn concert with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29CFR 1910.119, the Fitchburg facility has conducted hazard assessments on the acrylic emulsion manufacturing process to evaluate the likelihood and consequences of process upsets and to recommend and install appropriate safeguards. EPA's RMP regulations require additional highly-structured assessments of offsite consequences in the form of a \"Worst-Case Scenario,\" and an \"Alternative Release Scenario\". A scenario is defined as an outline of a hypothed or projected chain of events, which can involve various emission estimating techniques, depending upon the specific circumstances o"

      "SummaryText": "f the release.  For example, the EPA published \"lookup tables\" are used to project the extent of a release of a hazardous substance, but does not account for local conditions like topography.  An alternative to using the lookup tables provided by the RMP regulation is to calculate the consequences of a release of a regulated substance using other (publicly-available) recognized risk analysis tools or \"models\".  Many models account for subtle but important local conditions that define the profile of a chemical release. Accordingly, Synthomer Inc. uses EPA-recognized models, RMP Comp, to project offsite consequences for both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\nThe worst case scenario is intended to predict the greatest possible severity of a chemical release. When properly used, the EPA-required worst-case hypothesis can be a very useful emergency planning tool, by providing an analysis of offsite conditions and community safeguards. The worst case scenario does not describe overall risk from a process or facility because it lacks the dimension of likelihood. For example the worst case scenario does not recognize the effectiveness of \"active\" safety devices that have been engineered into a process such as containment, sprinkler, or quench systems which can stop or greatly reduce the severity of a chemical release. Furthermore, the unlikely (complete) loss of a vessels structural integrity and instantaneous release of the entire contents is contemplated in the worst case model. As a final note, it should also be recognized that for a toxic worst case, the impacted area is extrapolated to the area of a circle, despite the use of a 1.5 meter-per-second wind speed, which will transport vapors in one general sector from the point of release.\n\nSynthomer has also prepared an \"Alternative Release Scenario\" which is intended to represent a more likely description a chemical release scenario from the Fitchburg facility because this exercise attempts to account f"

An additional worst case scenario must be prepared if different public \"receptors\" (off site residences, businesses or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material. Since the Fitchburg facility only handles one RMP substance, additional scenarios are not applicable. \n\nDescriptions of the Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios have been removed from the Executive Summary section of this RMP submittal consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155, as amended April 9, 2004, 69 FR 18819.\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nSynthomer is committed to operating safe plants and safeguarding the communities in which we operate.

Synthomer has a trained and equipped emergency response team capable of handling foreseeable emergencies.  Coordination with local emergency response agencies is a key element of the emergency response planning process.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility. Continued training and planned drills will sustain and improve emergency response capabilities.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe site's SHE Improvement Plan includes initiatives to drive improvement in the areas of Safety, Health, Environmental & Security. These initiatives include Awareness & Exposure Reduction, SHE Culture, Risk Management, Business integration of SHE Processes, Social Responsibility and Security. The facility's Annual Operating Plan includes goals and objectives in these strategic areas to drive continual improvement of our safety, health, environmental and security practices. \n\nLESSONS LEARNED:      \nSynthomer and its Fitchburg facility recognize that risk management is a continuous learning process, and we can learn from both probable and improbable accidental release scenarios.  The RMP scenarios developed for the Fitchburg facility show how significantly the process safety elements contribute to continuously managing risk: having relevant process safety information, review of process and equipment changes before they are made, a review of equipment and preparedness before starting up modified or new equipment (strong Management of Change & Pre-Startup Safety Review process), strong"
