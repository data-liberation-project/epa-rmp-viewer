The facility is located in Dupont, Colorado. The\r\n40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane. Butane is held on-site in piping in a\r\nquantity greater than 10,000 lbs for blending into gasoline. The maximum intended inventory is 9,031,753 lbs of butane.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Dupont Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with\r\nresources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design,\r\ninstallation, operations, and maintenance procedures. If an emergency were to occur, it is\r\nMagellan's policy to notify the Dupont terminal area LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\r\nThe regulated butane blending process in the facility is compliant with all elements of the Risk\r\nManagement Program (RMP) and other employee training programs, along with operating and\r\nmaintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on\r\nwhether or not they were used as safeguards in the initial PHA for this facility. There may be other\r\nprocess controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the initial PHA. The facility\r\nhas no Trade Secrets. The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak\r\ndetection of valves and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThis process is new thus there have been no accidental releases from the butane process\r\nat the Dupont terminal.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. In the event of fire or explosion, or a\r\nrelease of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified\r\nendp"
