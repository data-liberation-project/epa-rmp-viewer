Vinyl acetate monomer is stored in a 1,000,000 gallon tank, and ethylene is stored in a 20,000 pound capacity process tank.  The vinyl acetate monomer and ethylene are stored at atmospheric temperature and pressure.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP notes a catastrophic release scenario of vinyl acetate monomer with a toxic endpoint of greater than 25 miles, taking into consideration that the tank does not have secondary containment, and an alternate release scenario of a ruptured pipe which shows a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles.  Public receptors are located within the worst-case scenario radii. \n\n\n\nThe RMP notes a catastrophic flammable release via vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 0.2 miles, and an alternate release scenario of a ruptured pipe which shows a flammable endpoint of 0.07 miles. No public receptors are located within the radii, as the radii encompass only the grounds of the industrial facility. \n\n\n\nThe facility is engaged in the production of vinyl alcohols, which involved vinyl acetate monomer, a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantity of vinyl acetate monomer present at the Kuraray facility, the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM requirements, and therefore, the Kuraray facility satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP program.  The Kuraray facility has a fully implemented OSHA PSM standard requirement, which is used as the RMP prevention plan to prevent accidental releases and plan for emergency actions. \n\n\n\nA brief summary of the implemented PSM program is as follows:\n\n?    Process safety information, which defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a process.  The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operat"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters including specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.  Specific individuals are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n?    The facility has a comprehensive program to confirm that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as expertise in systems control technology and engineering.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n?    The facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) process startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process.  \n\n?    To complement the written procedures for process operations, Kuraray and the facility have implemented an employee participa"

New employees receive basic training in process operations and, after successfully completing this training, are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  Operators are allowed to work independently only after demonstrating, through tests and/or various skill demonstrations, that they possess adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n?    The facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\n?    The facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, such as, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of process startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly impleme"

To verify that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility will periodically conduct a compliance audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years or more often if facility changes require further review.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\n?    The facility promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or potentially could result in, a fire or explosion, major property damage, environmental release, or personal injury.  The Kuraray facility has had no accidental releases that meet the above criteria.  All incidents that result in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace must be investigated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  \n\n\n\n?    The facility has a comprehensive and well defined employee participation program to ensure that all terminal employees are well versed in safety and hazards. \n\n\n\n?    Kuraray has not had any accidents in the past five years that resulted in a loss of life or evacuation from the covered processes. Kuraray is purchasing the facility and will be a new owner.\n\n\n\n?    Kuraray and the facility's landlord have a service level agreement for provision of fire, protection, and emergency response services. The facility and Kuraray has a plan in place. Kuraray maintains emergency response plans for natural disasters, mechanical failures, and human or operator error. The plan has firmly established roles and responsibilities for the site. \n\n\n\n?    Currently, there are no plans to improve health and safety beyond encouragi"
