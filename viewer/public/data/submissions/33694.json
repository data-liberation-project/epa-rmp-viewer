The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This plan is reviewed and updated at least once a year.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Deans Services facility is located at 1600 Donner Avenue in san Francisco California. This facility provides refrigeration for food products. The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states( high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor,, then back to high pressure liquid ) in order to provide refrigeration for product. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature. Low pressure liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back to a liquid. Typical operating pressure range from 0 psig on the low side of the system to 150 psig on the high side. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant with an inventory of 18000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nThe worst case release scenario is a release of the total quantity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receiver ( located in the engine room ) is the largest vessel in the system with a capacity of 18000 pounds and is assumed to be f"

      "SummaryText": "ull for the worst case scenario. Sincethe receiver is enclosed by the facility, passive mitigation effects were taken into consideration when determining the relese rate of ammonia to the outside atmosphere.The most pessimistic meteorlogical conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability. This facility is located in an urban setting. The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using exhibit 4-4 from EPA's Risk mManagement Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities, November 1998. This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors. No environmental receptors are affected.\n\nAlternatve Release Result Summary\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a .25 inch diameter leak of high pressure ammonia liquid for one hour. The quantity released in one hour at this rate is 7500 pounds. This release could occur due to a gasket ruptur, pinhole leak, seal leak, etc. In adddition this release could occur outside; therefore passive mitigation measures were not utilized.The meteorlogical conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability.This facilty is located in an urban setting. The maximum potential downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigerated Facilities, November 1998. This potential release scenario reaches off-site and may affect population receptors. No environmental receptors are affected by this scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVRNTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures:\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Amminia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\nIIAR Bulletin 109 \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\nIIAR Bulletin 110 \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\nIIAR \" A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\nBuilding Codes:"

      "SummaryText": "\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDeans Services has a response plan for on site emergency operations. This plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases.Deans policy is to call 911 in the event of an ammonia release. The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.There are 3 Operations Level trained employees at the facilty. The Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the emergency coordinators, staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous materials agency notification procedures. This plan then proceeds to to detail the procedures for employees and management in the event of a fire, evacuation, compressor room shutdown, earthquake, blackout, and ammonia release/clean-up.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment. The management at Deans is planning to continue with the program as follows:\n1. Continued maintenance program for ammonia refrigeration equipment to ensure ongoing integrity of the equiopment.\n2. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the On-Site Emergency Response Plan\n3. Continue to have employee involvement in safety development.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\nA complete Process Hazard Analysis will be performed in December 2004 to identify potential safety issues."
