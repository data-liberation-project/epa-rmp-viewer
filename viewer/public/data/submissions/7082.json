      "SummaryText": "The Schuylkill County Municipal Authority (SCMA) ownes and operates the Broad Mountain Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located in Blythe Township,  approximately 1.2 miles north of the Borough of St. Clair. The Broad Mountain WTP is a PA DEP approved facility constructed in 1994 and rated at 4.42 MGD.  Finished water serves portions of Borough of St. Clair, Port Carbon, Mechanicsville, Palo Alto, portions of the Townships of Blythe, New Castle, Norwegian, East Norwegian and portions of the City of Pottsville.\n\nThe method of disinfection at the Broad Mountain WTP utilizes chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5).  At any given time, the maximum amount of chlorine on site is 8,000 pounds (4-1 ton cylinders).  Since the amount is >2,500 lbs, SCMA is submitting the Risk Management Plan in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Parts 9 and 68 List of Regulated Substances and Thresholds for Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Release Prevention.\n\nThe SCMA Broad Mountain WTP qualifies as a Program 1 due to the following:\n\n   (1)  For the past five years, the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radient heat generated by a fire involving the substance\nled to death, injury or response or restoration activities for an \nexposure of an environmental receptor.\n\n    (2) The distance to a toxic endpoint for a worst-case release assessment conducted under Subpart B and Section 68.25 is less than the distance to any public receptor, as defined in Section 68.30.  The distance to a toxic endpoint for a worst-case release has been calculated to be 0.8 miles.  The calculation was performed using the EPA computer program RMP Comp.  The distance to the nearest public receptor is 1.0 miles.  The following\nassumptions were made regarding the inputs to the program:\n\n           "

Urban setting - chosen because it depicts a non-flat open                    terrain.  The facility is located in a mountainous region                    in a densely wooded area.

Enclosed storage room in direct contact with outside air\n\n   (3)  Emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the stationary source and local emergency planning and response organizations.  The SCMA Broad Mountain WTP has developed an Off-Site Response Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Super-fund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Act, Pennsylvania Act 1990-165,\nby the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Schuylkill County.  The most recent revision of the Plan is dated \nJanuary 15, 1997.\n\nThe Broad Mountain WTP is manned 24 hours per day.  The facility is equipped with chlorine gas detectors located in the chlorine feed area and chlorine cylinder storage area.  The cylinders are stored in an enclosed room that is isolated from the rest of the building and equipped with an exhaust system and gas detectors.  This detector activates an alarm at the main control panel for response by the plant operator.  The facility is equipped with 2 SCBA's, a one-ton cylinder emergency repair kit, and dry chemical fire extinguishers.  All opertors are trained in chlorine handling procedures."
