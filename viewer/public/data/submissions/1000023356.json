Regency operates natural gas \n\nprocessing plants in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico.  The Keystone gas \n\nplant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to \n\ncontrol and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nThe facility and system of pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, Texas Railroad Commission, the \n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department \n\nof Transportation.  This facility is covered by OSHA PSM standard.  These agencies\n\nconduct periodic facility inspections and report findings to Regency management.\n\n\n\nThis facility receives gas from surrounding oil and gas fields and other sites.  Gas is recieved in the Keystone facility with the hydrogen sulfide and water removed.  The natural gas liquids as well as the compressed natural gas are then transported from the facility through pipelines to third party customers.  The two compounds in the facility that contain substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) in the amounts greater than threshold quantity are demethanized natural gals liquids (NGL) and Propylene.  These are both reported as flammable liquids.  The NGL is made up of RMP regulated substances of ethane, propane, butane, methane, etc.\n\n\n\nThere are no public receptors within the distance of the endpoint of the worst case scenario.

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergecny response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Keystone gas plant is located northeast of Kermit, in Winkler County, Texas.  \n\n\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release would be the loss of all of the NGL in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPA RMP Comp. the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.3 miles.  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \n\n\n\nPotential releases have been discussed with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Winkler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\n\nThe Keystone Gas Plant operates under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety has helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n    \n\nInstallation of a continuous lit natural gas flare.\n\n    \n\nFire water monitors that will spray "
