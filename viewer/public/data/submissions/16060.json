      "SummaryText": "F. R. Blankenstein Co. has been under this name since 1939.  Our sales are approximately 80% wholesale/industrial and 20% retail.  We stock and sell welding, restaurant, janitoral, paper, water treatment, swimming pool, and household supplies and equipment.  All merchandise purchased from our suppliers are bought, received, and sold as it comes from them.  Nothing is altered, repacked, relabeled, manufactured or otherwise.\n\nFor over 40 years we have bought, stocked, and sold 150 lb. cylinders of chlorine gas. (from Tesco, then Thompson-Hayward, and now Harcros).  During this four decade span we, with our suppliers, have held safety training seminars every two to four years for our customers.  Factory qualified people demonstrate safety kits and put on training programs including slides, film, and video tape.  All water works, waste water systems, fire departments, and interested industries are invited and most attend.  This was done a long time before the government regulations.  We do not sell chlorine gas to anyone else than those named.  We do not sell chlorine gas to any swimming pools.\n\nWe work closely with the Natchez Fire Department and the Adams County Civil Defense.  The Fire Department brought each fireman on each of three shifts to our warehouse and video-taped our whole facility as we walked through the whole building discussing hazards and plans in case of an emergency."
