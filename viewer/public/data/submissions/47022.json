Each container once accepted is then placed within the chlorine container storage room and logged in on the chlorine inventory sheet when put into service.  All container data is noted on a daily inventory sheet (a copy is attached).\n     Trained personnel are required for the unloading and loading of chlorine containers, using approved procedures of the chlorine institute. Each time a chlorine container is put into service, each operator checks all connections for leaks with ammonia solution prior to placing the chlorine container on line.\n     The Town of Somerset Water Pollution Control Facility also provides employees a chlorine safety-training seminar annually, which is conducted by the chlorine supplier in which all employees who could potentially handle chlorine are required to attend (certificate enclosed). Also, the Somerset Fire Department has one of their members in attendance.\n     All chlorine equipment is placed on an annual maintenance program which is completed by the equipment representative, ABB who is trained in the maintenance and opertation of this specific chlorine equipment. All equipment is inspected and tested each year. All equipment is tagged with its inspection date and its next inspection service date (copy of tag enclosed). In addition, plant personnel make daily and weekly inspections of the chlorine process.\n     Entries to the chlorine building are locked to prevent unauthorized access. The area is marked and posted \"Danger Chlorine\", and both the chlorine container storage room and the Chlorination Feed Room have been equipped with ventilation system which was redesigned, upgraded and put into service in 1990.

      "SummaryText": "     Town of Somerset Water Pollution Control is located at 116 Walker Street in Somerset, Massachusetts.  At this Facility sewage is processed at an average rate of approximately three and one-half million gallons per day.  Liquid chlorine is received in one-ton containers for use in its process for disinfecting which is later dechlorinated with Sodium Bisulfite before discharge into the Taunton River.  Containers are shipped in four one ton containers per shipment for the facility and the maximum amount stored in the facility would be approximately 10,000 pounds.  We order chlorine containers when four containers are empty, and one full container is on line.  All records of chlorine deliveries and empty containers shipped back are kept in file via bill of lading invoices.  (Sample Enclosed)\n     Chlorine is fed at a rate of approximately fifty pounds per day in our treatment process, and is always withdrawn as a gas.  The containers are received and the unloading of containers and their connection to the feed system is perfored by two (2) individuals who have been trained in chlorine handling, chlorine safety, and follow developed policies and procedures for these tasks\n     Start-up training on all components of the chlorine feed equipment was conducted during 1990 when the treatment facility was renovated and new equipment was installed.  At that time all employees were trained on this feed equipment along with system operation, chlorine safety, and troubleshooting.  The department also has an annual service contract to provide for the repair and preventative maintenance of all components of the chlorine feed system including chlorine detection equipment. The department inventories repair parts and preventative maintenance kits to service the crucial components of the Chlorination system.\n     Periodic safety audits are performed by the Town of Somerset Fire Department along with safety reviews by the Town Insurance Carrier, also, equipment and process inspectio"

      "SummaryText": "ns by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection inspectors.  The Somerset Water Pollution Control Department is committed to provide a safe and environmentally sound operation.  We provide safety training on the use of chlorine, and its risks, also, develop and implement department policies in an effort to eliminate any risk of accidental release at this facility.\n     Chlorinating is accomplished through a gas chlorination system using ejectors to draw the chlorine gas from the pressurized containers through a control valve and a rotometer to regulate the chlorine dosage. The chlorine is mixed into a flow of plant water to produce the required chlorine solution. The chlorine solution will have the same pressure as the plant water. The amount of chlorine applied is automatically proportioned by the rate of flow through the Parshall flumes, adjusted for flow equalization."
