Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Glenn Fertilizer Company facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at County Road 57 and Highway 99W, Willows, California, 95988 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000-gallon and one 15,000 gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 146,625 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight)  is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in two 120,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 1,800,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  450,000 pounds.  \n\n3.

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.0 miles.   The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release from a broken 3-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\nb.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 900,000 pounds of solution ammonia (containing 225,000 pounds ammonia based on a 25% active ingredient).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.6 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Res"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the aqua ammonia processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs."
