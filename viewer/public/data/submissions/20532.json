Chlorine is conservatively applied in the treatment process by a professional operational staff to safely maximize effectiveness and minimize risks and by-product formation.  It is the goal of Clayton County Water Authority to apply chlorine safely and to eliminate the possibility of accidental releases.\n\nThe regulated stationary source of concern in this document is elemental chlorine.  Risk plans are based on an accidental release of chlorine gas.  Our prevention program includes training, excercises, coordination with local emergency response personel and an internal chlorine response team.\n\nOur history has demonstrated the effective procedures in place to minimize chlorine related risks. As reported in the five year accident history included in this doccument, we have had no accidental releases. We will not rely on our past to insure our effectiveness in the future.  This Chlorine Risk Management Plan (RMP) details our efforts to achieve continued effectiveness\n\nThis RMP was developed to document personnel preparedness, equipment maintenance, and emergency response preparedness related to handling, storage and use of chlorine in the water production process at the J.W. Smith Water Plant of the Clayton County Water Authority. The prevention program details elements that are in place to be certain chlorine delivery equipment is maintained, operations personnel are properly trained in system operation and maintenance personnel are trained in maintenance procedures.  This RMP also details emergency response measures.  If an emergency situation occurs, operations personnel are trained in appropriate response procedures.  These procedures are designed to protect operational personnel and alert emergency response personnel to minimize risk to the community.  This RMP addresses response from internal chlorine response perso"
