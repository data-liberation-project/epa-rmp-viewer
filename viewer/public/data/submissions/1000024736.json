Airgas - Mid America trucks pick up returned (empty) propane and propylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propane is stored at the stationary source in four small, interconnected bulk tanks.  Propylene is stored at the stationary source in a large bulk tank.  Propane and Propylene are transferred from the bulk tanks into propane and propylene cylinders, respectively.  The full propane and propylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas - Mid America to customers.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention processes that are specific to propane and propylene, and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered processes had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within the past 5 years.  In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.
