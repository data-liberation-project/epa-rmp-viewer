This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDegussa-H\u00fcls has a nine-point policy guiding the accidental release prevention program. These are:\n\n1) Use applicable design safety codes and standards as the basis for design, construction, operation, and maintenance in our facilities.\n2) Evaluate facilities, equipment and processes for safety and health concerns.\n3) Use multiple safeguards to provide layers of protection in the design, construction and operation of facilities, in order to prevent a single failure from escalating into a catastrophic event.\n4) Document the safety and health evaluation.\n5) Inspect and evaluate process equipment against the design specifications.\n6) Maintain current and complete documentation of the process and equipment throughout the lifetime of the process.\n7) Develop a Management of Change procedure to control minor changes to process technology, operation and maintenance that may affect the safety of the process.\n8) Review all changes to process equipment, procedures and practices to ensure the continued safety of employees and facilities.\n9) Develop inspection and maintenance programs that ensure the continued integrity of facilities.\n\n\nDegussa-H\u00fcls has a nine-point policy guiding the emergency response program.

This facility employs 786 personnel. Eight production areas produce 15 products in a continuous production schedule, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: acrolein, ammonia, chlorine, epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid, methyl mercaptan, propylene, trichlorosilane, and trimethylamine.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 400,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud.

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Degussa-H\u00fcls has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Degussa-H\u00fcls conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDegussa-H\u00fcls resolves all findings from process hazard analysis, some of which result in modifications to the process.
