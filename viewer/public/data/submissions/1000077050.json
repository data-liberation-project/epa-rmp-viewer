An outline of the RMP Program is provided in Table ES-1.  The disinfection process using ammonia is covered under this regulation at the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans (S&WB) Carrollton Water Purification Plant (WPP).\n\nTo meet the regulation requirements, this report contains useful information on the  ammonia system.  The technical information contained in this report may be used as a reference in initial and recurring operator training.  Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nTable ES-1 \n\n\n\nOutline of RMP Program\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n5-year Accident History\n\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nDocument Management System\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSafety Information\n\nHazard Review\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nMaintenance\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\nAn overview of the Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are also included in the report.

It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a public access database.  The RMP is intended to inform the public of Carrollton WPP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nES.1 Hazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Release Scena"

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or III) the Carrollton WPP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Carrollton's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The Carrollton WPP is operated by public personnel and therefore excluded from Program III.  Carrollton WPP is included in RMP Program II.  The Hazard Assessment is provided in Section 1 and Attachment No. 5.\n\n\n\nES.1.1 Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe WCS for the ammonia system (10,000 gallon tank) is defined as 10,000 gallons (51,500 lbs) of ammonia being released by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration.  This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP*Comp model.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia was determined to be 2.6-miles by the RMP*Comp model at the 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm) concentration specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\n\n\nES.1.2 Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario of ammonia was also modeled using RMP*Comp.  An estimation of approximately 820 pounds of ammonia released was derived from the scenario of an outdoors piping failure.  The toxic endpoint for the ammonia system ARS was determined to be 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nES.2 Five Year Accident History\n\nNo major accidents resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in-place, property damage or environmental damage have occurred between 2004 and February 2019.  Documentation for minor release incidents/leaks for the ammonia systems is included in Appendix D.\n\n\n\nES.3 Management Program\n\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below:\n\n\n\nES.3.1 Document Management "

This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these compounds.  The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant process is modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.  It is also imperative that plant operators and managers are apprised of the potential health hazards and exposure limits associated with these chemicals.\n\n\n\nES.4.3 Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information was compiled on each system studied.  Basic specifications on each process are included in this document for easy reference.  Details such as maximum inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, safe upper and lower pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process are provided in this section.

A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required documentation. The Training Policy is found in Section 8.  Training records are found in separate files from the RMP Manual.\n\n\n\nES.8 Maintenance\n\nBasic maintenance procedures have been developed by the Carrollton WPP and are included in Section 7. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, as well as to the off-site public.  In the event of an inspection or compliance review, state and federal regulators will request to see documentation and record keeping associated with the Maintenance Program.  These records are found in separate files from the RMP Manual.\n\n\n\nES.9 Incident Investigation\n\nAn Incident Investigation Program has also been developed.  The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the ammonia system.  The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24-hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently.  Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future.  Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.  No reportable incidents occurred at the Carrollton WPP during the 5-year reporting period (between 2004 and 2009; 2009 and 2014) and at the present time for the current reporting period (between 2014 and 2019).\n\n\n\nES.10 Compliance Audits\n\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document.
