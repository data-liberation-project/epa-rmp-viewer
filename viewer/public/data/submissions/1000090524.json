We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Selkirk Terminal located in Albany County, New York, is owned by Enterprise Terminals and Storage, LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\n\n\n\nThe Selkirk Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline and is stored in any of six above ground storage tanks.  The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tank into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.  The facility also has a 10-spot railcar rack that can be used for the receipt or delivery of propane by pressuri"

Several small propane storage tanks are also on-site for use as domestic and flare pilot fuel.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane and ethyl mercaptan are the only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Selkirk Terminal.  \n\n\n\nThe Terminal is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Selkirk Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Selkirk Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work per"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Selkirk Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n* Terminal fire detection system\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n*Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high flow).\n\n*Secondary containment to contain any release of liquid ethyl mercaptan.\n\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n\n*Storage tank internal emergency shut down and excess flow valves\n\n*Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers\n\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n*A firewater loading rack deluge system and storage tank and rail car rack fire monitor system.\n\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, flame retardant coveralls, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nThe Selki"

      "SummaryText": "rk Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedures are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Selkirk Terminal is coordinated with the Selkirk Fire Department.  The Selkirk Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate fire department officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic meetings with the fire department, the Selkirk Terminal conducts periodic site orientations and emergency response briefings for emergency response organizations.  The Selkirk Terminal also provides periodic refresher training for local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Selkirk Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Selkirk Terminal.\n\n\n\n* There are no planned changes at the Selkirk Terminal."
