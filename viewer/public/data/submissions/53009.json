      "SummaryText": "The Caterpillar Inc., Motion & Power Control Division, Hydraulic and Hydraulic Systems facility located at 2200 Channahon Road in Joliet, Illinois (Facility) operates a stationary source in accordance with a CAAPP permit, No. 95120095.  This stationary source will include one (1) covered process consisting of four (4) interconnected propylene aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) with a maximum capacity of 38,000 pounds.  As of October 2008, there are two (2) existing propylene ASTs.  The Facility plans to install two (2) additional propylene ASTs.  The four (4) ASTs will be interconnected and located approximately 200 feet east of the southeast corner of Building B.  The propylene will be stored as a liquid under pressure.  The propylene will be vaporized and utilized as a fuel in the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) Thermal Spray Systems that spray apply chrome coating on metal parts used in the manufacture of various types of heavy-duty, off-road equipment.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the two (2) existing propylene ASTs during the past three (3) years when the Facility began using propylene as a fuel in the HVOF process.\n\nThe Facility's existing Disaster Plan, revised in February 2008, covers emergency response policies and procedures in the event of a disaster, such as an explosion, at the Facility.\n\nThe propylene ASTs will be surrounded by a barrier to be determined to prevent any potential damage from motor vehicles."
