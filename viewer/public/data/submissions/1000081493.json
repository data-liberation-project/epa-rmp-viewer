This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training of personnel and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes at EDNF. EDNF implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. EDNF places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspection and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release. \n\n\n\n2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEDNF operates a variety of processes to produce anhydrous ammonia and upgrade our ammonia products into urea ammonium nitrate solutions, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea.\n\n\n\n3    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEDNF has implemented an accidental release prevention program. The accidental release prevention program required for Program 3 processes is summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the facility's accident prevention program is a critical component of the overall objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of a flammable or toxic substance.  Employee involvement helps to ensure that all perspectives regarding accident prevention are considered for implementation. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning employees, contractors and the public.\n\n\n\nEDNF strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through, for example, regularly "

EDNF actively seeks employee involvement in the development and implementation of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate programs. Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions, if necessary. Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective accident prevention program, as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis. The process safety information is readily available to all employees and used by facility personnel, the process hazard analysis team and persons in charge of updating the emergency response plan. EDNF maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency responses/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nEDNF also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment at the facility. This information includes, but is not limited to, materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and"

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of facility personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and may include third parties. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed. Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change at the facility. Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) initial startup; (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; and (7) startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. Operating procedures are reviewed periodically, and as operational changes are introduced and a"

Both operators and technical staff participate in the review and certification process. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEDNF has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the processes at the facility. New employees receive training in process operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nEDNF uses contractors to supplement its workforce and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules; and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers: (1) a process overview; (2) information about the safety and health hazards; (3) emergency response plan requirements; and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, EDNF evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. EDNF personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nEDNF conducts a PSSR on any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information.
