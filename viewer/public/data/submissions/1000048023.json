The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facilitiy's primary activities encompass wholesale chemical distribution. We have five regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include, Hydrofluoric Acid, Aqueous Ammonia >20%, Formaldehyde Solutions, Ethylenediamine, and Isopropylamine.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Brenntag Northeast, Inc. maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analysis is \"FEMA\" and the \"Fault Tree Analysis\" methodology. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Northeast, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to warehousemen involved "
