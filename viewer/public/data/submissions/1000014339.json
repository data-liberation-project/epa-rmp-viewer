This rule is aimed at preventing accidental releases and reducing the severity of those releases that do occur.  This Rule has been amended and updated on several occasions.\n\nWastewater treatment facilities with on-site storage of a A?processA? which contains any of the extremely hazardous toxic and flammable substances listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 40 CFR 68.130 in an amount above the A?threshold quantityA? specified for that substance, is required to develop and implement a risk management program.  For the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant, liquid chlorine used for the disinfection process exceeds EPSA?s threshold quantity and sulfur dioxide, also used in the disinfection process, exceeds the OSHA threshold quantity.  For the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant, the facility must be in compliance no later than the date on which there is more than a threshold quantity of a listed substance on the site.\n\nDepending on the specific characteristics of a covered process, the POTW may be subject to one of three different sets of requirements (called program levels).  The Inman facility falls into Program 3, the highest level.]\n\nThe Risk Management Program has four major components:\nA?    Hazard Assessment,\nA?    Prevention Program\nA?    Emergency Response Plan, and a\nA?    Risk Management Plan.\n\nEach of these components is address in subsequent sections of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nThe RMP rule requires that a Management System be in place to:\nA?    Develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements;\nA?    Designate a qualified person or position with the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements; and\nA?    Document the names of people or positions and define the lines of authority through an organizational "

Since the program requires ongoing implementation of accident prevention and emergency response measures, management commitment does not end when the risk management plan is submitted to EPA.\n\nIn the hazard assessment section of the Risk Management Program, facilities must evaluate the possible consequences of an accidental release to nearby communities, schools, hospitals, recreational facilities, and other public and environmentally sensitive areas by predicting the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" (i.e., more likely) release scenarios.  Facilities must also document past accidents that have occurred at the facility for the last five years.\n\nThere are two areas to be addressed as a party of the Hazard Assessment component of the Risk Management Program as follows:\nA?    Five Year Accident History \nA?    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe City of Inman facility has had no reportable releases in the past five years.\n\nThe worst-case release scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide from the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant were evaluated.  The toxic endpoints are: \nChlorine: 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm)\nSulfur Dioxide: 0.0078 mg/L (3 ppm)\n\nThe regulations require that tables or models for atmospheric dispersion analysis be used that appropriately account for gas density.  For the specific case of WWTPs, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are always dense gases (that is, denser than air).\n\nChlorine is present in one-ton cylinders at the facility.  The worst-case scenario assumes that this quantity, i.e., 2,000 pounds, is completely released over a period of 10 minutes (e.g., 200-lb/min rate of release).  The predicted distance to"

In addition, the RMP must indicate whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\nBased on information from the 2000 census tracts in the vicinity of the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant, an estimated population of 12,952 people is currently within the 3.0 mile radius to the endpoint for the worst case release scenario.  There are also several industrial plants, and commercial areas.  There are no schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreational areas or arenas within the circle for the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant.  There are also several industrial plants, and commercial areas.  There are no schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreational areas or arenas within the circle for the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThere are no environmental receptors areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas within the circle for the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe EPA Prevention Program includes the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard.  Whenever possible, EPA used OSHA's language verbatim.  However, there were a few terms that EPA had to change to reflect the differences between its authority and OSHA's.  The PHA should also be updated or revalidated whenever there is a new hazard or risk created by changes to the process.  \n\nPart 68 requires implementation of an emergency response program if facility employees will respond to some releases involving regulated substances.  An emergency response program consists of an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, employee training, and procedu"

      "SummaryText": "res to ensure the program is up-to-date.\n\nEPA recognizes that, in some cases, it may not be appropriate for employees to conduct response operations for releases of regulated substances.  EPA does not intend to force such facilities to develop emergency response capabilities.  At the same time, facility managers are responsible for ensuring effective emergency response to any releases at the facility.  In the case of the City of Inman wastewater treatment plant, public responders other than plant personnel are available and are capable of providing adequate response.\n\nEPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities which allows certain facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan.  Since there is likely to be toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity present at the City of Inman Wastewater Treatment plant, an emergency coordinator has been designated to work with the local emergency planning and response officials on chemical emergency preparedness issues.\n\nOnce the RMP has been prepared and submitted, EPA will make it available to the public. Members of the public may obtain copies of RMPs by requesting them from EPA in writing.  In view of the publicA?s access to RMPs, it should be expected that the community will discuss the hazards and risks associated with the facility as indicated in the RMP. \nCommunication with the public can be an opportunity to develop a relationship with the community and build a level of trust among neighbors, and the community at large.  By complying with the RMP rule, a number of steps are being taken to prevent accidents and protect the community.  These steps are the individual elements of the risk management program.  A well-designed and properly implemented risk management program will set the stage for informative and productive dialogue with the community.\n"
