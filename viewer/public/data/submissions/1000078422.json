Duda & Sons, Inc., owns and operates fresh vegetable processing, cold storage, and shipping facilities at their 6000 Duda Road, Belle Glade, Florida location. This location is known as the Belle Glade \u201cPacking Facility\u201d.\n   \nDandy Cooling, Inc., a partnership of A. Duda & Sons, Inc. and Western Precooling Systems, Inc., leases and operates those portions of the Packing Facility where anhydrous ammonia is used in closed loop refrigeration systems to cool and store the fresh vegetable products. \n\nThe Packing Facility is a 176,000 square foot building where the various facilities and operations are centered. Adjacent accessory buildings and equipment provide support functions to the Packing Facility operations. Mechanical refrigeration systems are used in and adjacent to the Packing Facility to obtain the proper product temperature and to maintain the proper product temperature while the product is stored prior to shipping. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by many food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration systems consist of pressure vessels, evaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment.\n\nHoused within the Packing Facility, System 1 is the largest refrigeration system onsite. System 1 provides refrigeration for the main cold storage rooms and for other cooling equipment located inside the Packing Facility.\n\nLocated on the north side of the Packing Facility, Systems 3, 4, and 5 are smaller, separate, refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration for chilled water and vacuum cooling operations. These Systems are separate processes utilizing a combination of mobile and fixed refrigeration equipment.\n\nLocated near the southwest"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency action and evacuation including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  In the event of an emergency involving a release of ammonia, it is the policy of the Facility to respond in a defensive manner as well as request assistance as necessary by calling the Palm Beach County fire department and hazmat team.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  \nDuda Farm Fresh Foods and Dandy Cooling are working together to improve and ensure the safety of their employees and community. Dandy Cooling will operate and maintain the Packing Facility refrigeration processes (or Systems) in accordance with IIAR Guidance. Duda Farm Fresh Foods and Dandy Cooling will continue to jointly implement the OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the EPA Risk Management Program.  Implementation of these programs is a continuous improvement process toward improved safety."
