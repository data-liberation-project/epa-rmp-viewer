We will provide a safe and productive workplace for our employees, conduct our operations in an environmentally responsible manner, comply with applicable laws and regulations and improve the communities where we live and work. We recognize that operating excellence does not just happen, and that we need to have management tools in place to organize and sustain the effort. \r\nAchieving excellence in our operations is the responsibility of every employee.  Operations line management must ensure the development and implementation of procedures which guide employee actions as appropriate.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training, engineering controls in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental and uncontrolled releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant is located in Andrews County, The CO2 Facility dehydration process produces product and a dry residue gas from accumulated casing head gas production.  The Mabee Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances above threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nProgram Level 1 processes do not require an accident prevention program. The Mabee Gas Plant has implemented an accident prevention program to satisfy the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  PSM requirements are consistent with the regulations outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident preventi"

Employees participate in review, compilation and updating technical documents and chemical inventories.  Employees participate as Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team members.\r\n\r\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the Facility accident prevention program. In addition, the Mabee Gas Plant has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include monthly safety meeting, planned inspections and operation improvement meetings which include affected plant personnel and management.   \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties   and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design criteria.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response, PPE requirements and exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) as part of the HAZCOM program.\r\n\r\nTechnical documents providing design and construction information of process equipment are maintained on site. This information includes construction materials, design limits, and electrical rating of equipment. The combination of appropriately trained personnel, written procedures and PSI data provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance intervals and procedures. Proposed design or process modifications are reviewed through the Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure that safety features and material of construction in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\n \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are"

This program systematically examines the process to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage the identified hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant personnel use various PHA processes including the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check List techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are initiated and tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nReviews are conducted at least  every  five years  and  will  be conducted at  this  frequency until  the  process  is no longer  operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as operating references by operations personnel and serve as training procedures for new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC process. In addition, the Mabee Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter in the DCS System that provides alarm notification for excess process control deviations. This information, along with written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n \r\nTraining\r\nComplemented by the written procedures the Mabee Gas Plant personne"

All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nContractors\r\nThe Mabee Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Mabee Gas Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n1.\tParticipate in Contractor / Visitor Orientation   \r\n2.\tPerform their work in a safe manner\r\n3.\tHave appropriate knowledge and skills\r\n4.\tAware of the hazards in their workplace\r\n5.\tUnderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n6.\tUnderstand and follow site safety rules\r\n7.\tInform Mabee Gas Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \r\n\r\nMabee Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
