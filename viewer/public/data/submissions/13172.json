Headquartered in Salisbury, MD, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states.  Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U.S. grain companies.  Perdue also manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Dillion Processing Plant is a poultry-processing plant located approximately two (2) miles west of Interstate I-95 on Highway 9 in Dillon, South Carolina.  The facility is a fast-food poultry processing plant that employs approximately 1,300 associates.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, five days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Dillon facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping, and air handling units located throughout the facility, in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is approximately 45,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Pedue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe working conditions and safe work practices.  Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipme"

The program involves local managers and a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Director of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe Perdue Farms Dillion facility maintains a Process Safety Management plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe predicted worst-case scenario for the refrigeration system is the catastrophic failure of one of the High Pressure Receivers (HPRs) located on the roof of the plant.  The vessel has a maximum storage capacity of 14,413 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Using EPA's RMP Comp Ver 1.06 modeling software, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.2 miles.  The estimated population within the 2.2-mile radius is 2,801 based on U.S. Census Bureau information contained in the LandView III mapping software.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThe predicted alternative release scenario for the refrigeration system is the release of anhydrous ammonia from breakage of the sight glass associated with one of the HPRs located on the"

The quantity of ammonia released in this scenario is 7,207 pounds.  This type of release would occur within 3.05 minutes.  Using the SLAB dispersion model, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.21 miles.  The estimated population within the 1.21-mile radius is 466, based on U.S. Census Bureau information contained in the LandView III mapping software.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThe Dillon facility has been operated by Perdue Farms since 1992 and has not had a serious accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, associate injuries, or property or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency response program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the refrigeration system, Perdue's Dillon facility has a well defined incident command system.  The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials.  Perdue continues to train its associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conducts mock drills routinely.  Perdue officials have discussed the company's response program with local LEPC and fire department representatives.\n\nAs part of its Risk Management Program (RMP), Perdue Farms has developed a RMP Communications Plan.  The goals of this plan are (1) to educate the public on potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue; (2) to respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communications; and (3) to be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental chemical release scenario.  Proactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, and how the community should respond; and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred are being prepared.
