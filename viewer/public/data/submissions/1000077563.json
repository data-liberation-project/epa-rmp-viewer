Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt this production facility, we use propane, butane, dimethyl ether, and 1,1-Difluoroethane, which is considered hazardous (flammable) by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle liquified petroleum gases, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program covers scenarios involving LP-Gas, and includes procedures for notification of the Rantoul Fire Department, and notification of any potentially-affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture and distribution of personal care products, with aerosol products accounting for approximately 20% of our business.  LP-gases are received by truck (transports) and stored in three 12,000-gallon stationary storage tanks on the North side of our facility.  The gas is used as a propellant in the filling of aerosol cans.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances we handle at this production facility are:  propane, butane, dimethyl ether, and 1,1-Difluoroethane.\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of propellants that can be stored at this plant in stationary tanks is 141,000 pounds.  At different times, we might also have up to three 11,000-gallon truck tankers (transports) containing special blends of propane, butane, dimethyl ether, and/or 1,1-Difluorethane for use in the same process, pushing the maximum amount of storage at any one time to 270,250 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "ted scenario.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:  A vapor cloud explosion involving one of the stationary storage tanks, when filled to the greatest amount allowed, would release approximately 55,692 pounds of propellant.  Assumptions for this scenario using RMP COMP include a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hr (1.5 meters/second), Stability Class:  F, and an air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi of the worst-case scenario is 0.3 miles, and could potentially impact the businesses of the industrial park.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:  A vapor cloud fire from a process piping break (using RMP COMP).  In this situation, it is estimated we would release approximately 6,000 pounds of propellant, with the resulting vapors reaching an ignition source, and causing a vapor cloud fire.  This release would affect an area 0.1 miles in diameter, and have a slight possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.  The industrial park businesses that might be affected would be the Eagle Wings Industries parking lot to the North, Alliance Resources to the South, and Engineered Plastic Components to the East.\n\n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nThis manufacturing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  All production employees receive training in how to work safely with aerosol products, while maintenance employees are trained in the hazards of propane, and how to work safely with the equipment.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nConair Corporation has not had any accident or incident involving propellant, or any other LP-gases.\n\n\n\n6.

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThe facility was constructed in 1990 with two tanks.  A third was added in 1992.  In 2002, we moved all underground piping aboveground, so that we could monitor more easily for leaks, and perform maintenance easier.  In 2003, we upgraded our gas detection equipment by installing MSA IR flammable gas sensors.  In 2007, we installed an emergency valve shut-off system to activate in the event of a hose breakaway.  In 2008, we added a reclaim system to reclaim propellant in the system.  In 2014, we changed and improved our piping configuration to eliminate the possibility of the accidental blending of propellants.  In 2019, we replaced piping that was starting to corrode.  We will continue to evaluate our equipment and methods, and make changes as necessary."
