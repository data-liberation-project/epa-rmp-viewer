Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:In our warehouse is located in Springfield, Illinois north of Capital Airport we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by United States Environmental Protection Agency. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.Our emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. Our chlorine storage is enclosed within a building on our property to help keep it secure. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:The regulated substance at this facility is chlorine.The primary purpose of this facility is to store and transfer 150# cylinders of Chlorine . Chlorine is received by truck (transports) and is stored inside a building on the south side of our property. The storage capacity of each cylinder vessel is 150 pounds of chlorine. We have a total capacity of 4 x 16 racked cylinders, therefore the maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at our plant is approximately 9,600 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:Chlorine Worst-Case Scenario: After careful review of potential worst-case scenarios, we feel that the largest quantity of a vessel (150pounds) released outside, during a cylinder unloading accident that causes rupture of the vessel, with no building passive mitigation effects, is our worst-case. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the worst-case scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario is approximately 1.5 miles.  Chlorine Alternative Scenario: A pig tail snapping causes a flashing liquid release through a small hole approximately 1/4 inch diameter. The liquid chlorine flashes immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and is carried downwind. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the alternative release scenario is estimated to be 0.5 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment. Our delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained in regard to chlorine hazards and emergency response. Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing chlorine to our site.\n\n\n\n5. Five-year accident history: We have had no accidents at this facility.\n\n6. The emergency response program:This facility's emergency response program is based upon the management system we have in place and the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency respondent. We have discussed this program with the Springfield Fire Department. \n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety: We have installed barricades to prevent the accidental impact from a collision with a forklift. We are installing chlorine alarm sensors to detect any leaks."
