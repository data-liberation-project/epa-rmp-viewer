(\u00bfGCOR\u00bf) is an industrial biotechnology facility that manufactures industrial enzymes.  The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9000:2000 certified facility employs 81 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.  \n\nIn March of 1999, Genencor initiated an effort to enhance the existing management system for the site.  This effort was guided by sustainable development principles, and incorporated equity, environmental and economic drivers into the site\u00bfs management system.  We feel that this \u00bfpeople/planet/profit\u00bf approach to our everyday business is a sound basis for the pursuit of long-term business viability while taking responsibility for improving the environmental, social, and economic conditions resulting from our activities.  Site goals and ongoing initiatives are tracked via yearly measures, which are issued through GCOR\u00bfs annual Sustainability Report.  Genencor\u00bfs latest sustainability report can be found at www.genencor.com.\n\nThe site manufactures enzymes through a fermentation-based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins, and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The site\u00bfs enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-shift Maintenance and Laboratory support.  Staff support includes site Management, Environmental Health & Safety, Engineering, Purchasing, Finance, and Systems personnel.\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Average on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 37,"

Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing any environmental impacts.  Release prevention methods are implemented where possible, including computer controls, automation, containment of all outdoor tanks; inside sump areas; and on-site air-scrubbing and neutralization capabilities.\n\nThe site\u00bfs management team is committed to the implementation of site environmental health & safety programs and supports the following:\nThe environmental health & safety budget is established to provide:\n\u00b7\tAppropriate and adequate personal protective equipment\n\u00b7\tAppropriate post-offer and annual medical examinations\n\u00b7\tTraining\n\u00b7\tAir monitoring equipment and analysis\n\u00b7\tHazardous waste pick-up for a conditionally-exempt small quantity hazardous waste generator\n\u00b7\tEmergency Response Team equipment and supplies\n\nA site Safety Committee is in place to foster the plant\u00bfs overall safety performance.

This team is not the safety police.\n2004 Goals:\nThree plant walk-arounds conducted per year.\nPhase 1:  The ratio of the number of Safety Alerts (SA\u00bfs) identified by the Safety Committee (SC) versus the Plant will inverse over time.  For example, if SC identifies 100 SA\u00bfs in 2004 and the Plant finds 10 SA\u00bfs, by 2005 the numbers should be reversed.\nPhase 2:  Total number of Safety Alerts will drop over time to some number.  This reflects the proactive safety response by everyone in the plant\n\nThe GCOR corporate sustainability vision and expectations lends guidance to site efforts.\nGenencor International Sustainability Policy:\nUsing our expertise in modern biotechnology, Genencor seeks to become a leader in sustainability. We will strive to emulate nature\u00bfs elegance \u00bf respecting the interrelationships of living organisms and making the most of the resources we use.  Through innovation and collaboration we will protect the environment, promote the well being of our employees and the world community.  \n\nIn the spirit of this intent, we will organize our work activities to improve continually in reducing the impact we have on the environment and to promote efficiency and fairness in our activities.  We will meet legal and internal requirements, minimize pollution and preserve resources.  These efforts will be widely communicated to employees as part of core corporate values.  Progress will be monitored and communicated to our stakeholders, and we will use their input to improve our performance as corporate citizens.  \n\n\nNew employees attend ~14 hours of initial safety training, which includes chemical awareness training as well as various OSHA and EPA-required information.
