      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHILLABEE POWER PLANT\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Hillabee Power Plant (Hillabee) is a power generation facility owned and operated by Exelon Generation Corporation (Exelon).  Exelon requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Exelon provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training.\n\n\n\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Hillabee Plant is located at 152 Brick Plant Road in Alexander City, Alabama.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia to supply the SCR system, which was installed to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted during the combustion of natural gas.  NOx reduction is necessary to meet ozone ambient air quality standards and technology-based air permit limits.  The SCR process involves the injection of ammonia into the flue gas that then passes through a catalyst bed of titanium dioxide, tungsten oxide, and vanadium pentoxide in which ammonia and NOx react, yielding harmless nitrogen and water vapor leaving the stack.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two pressure vessels, each filled to only 85 percent of its capacity as an administrative control.  When filled to the 85 percent level, each vessel holds approximately 12,000 gallons, or 60,000 pounds (lbs), of anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, the total anhydrous ammonia inventory in the process at any one time is 120,000 lbs.  This exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Hillabee Plant ammonia process is subject to both OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations. A well implemented PSM program is in place to manage OSHA PSM regulations. Per RMP regulations, the Hillabee Ammonia process meets the Program 3 Prevention criteria.  "

      "SummaryText": "Hillabee uses its PSM program as the required RMP Program 3 Prevention Program.  Hillabee's PSM program includes written operating procedures, preventative maintenance, and employee training to ensure safe operation of the ammonia process as part of compliance with 29 CFR 1919.119, OSHA's PSM standards. The PSM Program receives full support from the plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.  The ammonia process is protected by an excess flow valve system and by process-area ammonia detectors which will set off alarms if a release of ammonia is detected.  The Prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\na . Process safety information.\n\nHillabee maintains a variety of technical documents, including an emergency response plan, which helps to ensure and prepare all their employees and local emergency responders to know about the hazards associated with all the processes in the plant. These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances they handle, (b) operating parameters for the equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for the equipment. It is ensured that this information is available to all the employees at the plant.\n\n\n\nb. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nHillabee has a comprehensive hazard analysis program to help identify and evaluate the conditions that could potentially lead to a release of ammonia. This analysis is updated and revalidated every five years by Hillabee. Hillabee primarily uses the What-If/Checklist combined analysis technique to perform these evaluations, which is part of the OSHA Process Hazard Analysis program. The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have previous operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise in running the process. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes su"

They are later forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n c. Operating Procedures: \n\nHillabee operators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions that need to be taken during both normal operations and any process upsets. \n\n\n\nd. Training: \n\nHillabee trains their employees to ensure employees perform their tasks safely and effectively. The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written, oral and skill demonstration reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\n\n\n\ne. Mechanical Integrity: \n\nHillabee maintains their process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger the safety of the employees or the environment. Hillabee has a written Mechanical Integrity (MI) procedure included in the PSM/RMP Manual. The facility uses the MAXIMO computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) to track preventative maintenance (PM) activities. Maintenance procedures are contained within the MAXIMO software and accompany PM work order assignments when triggered by an established maintenance activity frequency. The mechanical integrity is based on the preventive maintenance program that includes regular inspection and testing of the equipment to identify any deterioration and failures and a cohesive quality assurance program for new and replacement equipment that would need to meet the required design standards.\n\n\n\nf.

All the proposed changes to chemicals, equipment or any other procedures are approved through this MOC process at the plant. This helps ensure that all the employees at the operational level are aware of the plant operation or process changes. \n\n\n\ng.

The completion of the review ensures equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and adequate safety, operating and emergency procedures are in place for smooth running of the process operations. \n\n\n\nh. Compliance Audit: \n\nHillabee performs a compliance audit for the PSM process every 3 years to ensure compliance with PSM prevention program. An audit team is assembled which include personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and the findings of the audit are documented in a report. All the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner, and appropriate modifications to the prevention program are implemented as necessary.\n\n\n\ni.
