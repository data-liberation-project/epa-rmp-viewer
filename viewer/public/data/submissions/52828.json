      "SummaryText": "Hallsmith Sysco Food services is a food service wholesale distribution and storage facility.  The facility has an Ammonia refrigeration system which services a variety of coolers and freezers in the plant.  Hallsmith Sysco has had a Process Safety Program in place since 1994 with a modern refrigeration system. The system is maintained daily with state licensed refrigeration technicians who are full time employees. The only material covered under this submission is Anhydrous Ammonia. The entire system holds approximately 22,954 pounds. The largest vessel can hold about 22,954 pounds and worst case scenario is estimated to be 70% of the vessel. This defines the worst case release to be 16,000 pounds in a short period of time. The refrigeration engine room is housed in a separate attached builiding to the main facility. The facility has  ammonia detection systems throughout the plant for leak detection. In the event of an Ammonia leak - the facility is evacuated and the Norton Fire Department and LEPC is contacted. Maintenance personnel are only allowed to assist the Norton LEPC - employees are not allowed to respond directly. There have been no accidental releases of Ammonia in the last five years. The facility recently updated their PSM program which reflected changes covered by the Management of change policy. The programs remain proactive to minimize risk and keep this critical refrigeration system at a high level of maintenance."
