The emergency response plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n\n\n3. To protect the environment.\n\n\n\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nRuprecht Company, Mundelein maintains a Process Safety Management committee which contains members who are the emergency coordinators for the facility. The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures for which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This plan was updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ammonia process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations. The facility is located at in Mundelein, IL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia for the manufacturing and storage of various food products. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors. The condensers are outside, and all evaporators/heat exchangers are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system installed was designed and constructed in accordance with ammonia refrigeration industry safety and design standards. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room. The engine room is provided with continuous and emerg"

In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"\"Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has had one accidental release.  The details of that release can be found in the Incident Investigation section of the Process Safety Management Program.  There were no hospitalizations as a result of the release, and one person offsite sought medical attention and was released from the hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest the leak will notify a supervisor, maintenance or risk management. Under certain circumstances an alarm will sound and automatically notify the fire department and maintenance supervisor. In either event, the fire department will respond to the emergency in coordination with the ammonia refrigeration contractor.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has completed a Compliance Audit as of 5/30/2019.
