The substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located onsite, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia contained in various vessels, piping, and heat exchangers is used in an ammonia refrigeration system.  The machine room houses the majority of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nRuiz Foods has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility.  The facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\no Employee Participation Program\n\no Process Safety Information\n\no Process Hazard Analysis\n\no Operating Procedures\n\no Training Program\n\no Contractor Safety Program\n\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\no Mechanical Integrity Program\n\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\no Management of Change Procedures\n\no Incident Investigation Procedures\n\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Ruiz facility in Florence, SC during this time (5 yr. period) that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Florence"
