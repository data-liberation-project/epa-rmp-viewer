Description of the Emergency Response Program \r\n\r\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Algona Fire Department and other agencies involved with response.  Representatives of the Algona Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to respond to any ammonia release.  This trained staffs are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nIdentification of opportunities and changes to improve safety is part of the culture of this plant.  In addition to the plant programs mentioned above, the following changes are planned. \r\nAlgona Food has demonstrated and plans several changes to improve employee\r\nand environmental safety, including but not limited to:\r\n      -     Machinery Room upgrades including ventilation to IIAR recommendations;\r\n      -     Annual employee Emergency Response Training; and \r\n-\tAssessing refrigeration needs and moving equipment to the roof."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \r\n\r\nThe Hormel Foods facility located in Algona, Iowa is a pork processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process raw pork into food products for distribution to retailers.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 1994 under the PSM standard. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditi"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \r\n\r\n\u00bf Employee Participation Program: \r\nThe Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.   \r\n\u00bf Process Safety Information: \r\nAmmonia refrigeration equipment manuals and plant design technical specifications including piping diagrams are on file.  \r\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis: \r\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in June 2014 and another PHA re-validation is schedule for June 2019.
