It is in full compliance with both EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations [40 CFR ?68] and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations [29 CFR ?1910].\n\n\n\nThe facility started up in the 4th quarter of 2016.  The 5-year accident history includes no accidents at the site.\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with the requirement of RMP and PSM, the site is also in compliance with the requirements of:\n\n?    29 CFR ?1910.38 Emergency Action Plans\n\n?    29 CFR ?1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\n\n?    29 CFR ?1910.165 Employee Alarm Systems.\n\n\n\nThere is a thorough management system in place to help ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements.  Liberty has conducted a thorough hazard analysis of the facility design and operation.  All planned changes resulting from that analysis have been implemented.\n\n\n\nAll operations and maintenance personnel (both direct employees and contractors) are/will be thoroughly trained on how to do their respective work, how to maintain safe operations, and how to respond to any emergency situations, should they arise.  The facility is operated and maintained using comprehensive procedures, all designed to keep the facility operating safely.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of an emergency, all personnel are trained in how to properly respond to keep CLGP workers, our neighbors, and the environment safe.  We continually work with local responders to ensure that they are trained and equipped to assist should an emergency arise.  Keeping everyone safe is of primary concern to Liberty.\n\n"
