The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Zotos International, Incorporated manufactures a variety of aerosol products.  Based on predictive filing, there could be as many as 14 substances and mixtures used in the aerosol process.  These substances include Butane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isopentane, Dimethylether, Propane,and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl].   Butane is used for aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for aerosol propellant.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for aerosol propellant. Isopentane is used for aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for aerosol propellant.  Dimethylether is used for aerosol propellant.  \n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 2004 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nZotos International, Incorporated maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equi"
