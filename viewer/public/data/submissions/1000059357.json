In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We maintain this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The SmithFoods Milk Process facility is located at 230 North Vine Street, Orville, Ohio. We manufacture dairy products. The facility has processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \n\n\n\nThe Milk Processing Facility refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nThe SmithFoods has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, avoid property damage, and offsite impacts.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepte"

Many policies are included in Volume 1, the remaining are referenced from other training manuals maintained in the facility.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: This includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standards, and information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (referenced from the IIAR ammonia Data Book).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Program: This program outlines a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards within a process involving potentially hazardous chemicals such as ammonia.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: develop, implement, and maintain clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration process during all operating phases. The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\n\n\n\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to work on the system, trained in the hazards associated with their work, and made aware of the hazards presented by the facility to the employees of the contractor.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review Programs: These programs have been developed to monitor and provide a \"checks and balances\" system to monitor changes in the facili"

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\n\n\n\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc..) have been developed..\n\n\n\nProcedures for conducting Compliance Audits, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, and Process Hazard Analyses have also been developed.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis 5 Year Re-validation was completed on July 21, 2016.  The PHA highlighted some deficiencies in the system. These items were addressed as part of the continuous improvement of the facility. These items were addressed on the basis of priority (Injuries to personnel).\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed Process and Instrumentation Diagrams for the individual system components. Flow schematics are included showing the entire system. A Block flow diagram provides a brief overview of the system. Drawings are included showing symbol and abbreviation descriptions.

All other associates should be kept away from the affected area.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the event of an evacuation the supervisor will announce the ammonia leak, which building, and the location in the building on the intercom by dialing 5004, so associates can evacuate away from the ammonia. Associates will attempt to turn off their machines if there is no immediate danger in doing so. Supervisors will check the bathrooms and lunch room before exiting the building. \n\n\n\n\n\nAll associates shall go to the assembly area where they are to remain until released by management.
