This has improved Boghosian Raisin Packing Co.'s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP/PSM/CalARP related events so that Boghosian Raisin Packing Co.'s management team can ensure that the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nBoghosian Raisin Packing Co. has implemented all aspects of the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program. When a RMP/PSM/CalARP Program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Boghosian Raisin Packing Co. has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP/PSM/CalARP Program implementation.\r\n\r\nBoghosian Raisin Packing Co. considers the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program a living document.
