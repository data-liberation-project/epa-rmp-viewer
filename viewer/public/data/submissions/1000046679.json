      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n    The Greater Johnstown Water Authority's Riverside Water Treatment Plant operates under the following objectives:  to provide sufficient water of safe, sanitary quality, and to provide an attractive water, which is free from objectionable turbidity, color, taste and odor.  In order to achieve these objectives, the implementation of Chlorine treatment is a necessity.  Due to the large volume of customers served by the Riverside Water Treatment Plant (over 62,000 persons), subsequently large volumes of Chlorine must be available on-site for the effective treatment process.\n\n    In compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Rule, Greater Johnstown Water Authority, RDM-Johnstown, LLC and Gibson-Thomas Engineering Co., Inc. have developed a Risk Management Plan that will aid in preventing avoidable accidents.\n\n    The Riverside Water Treatment Plant is located at 242 Neil Street in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  The Plant is owned by the Greater Johnstown Water Authority and operated by RDM-Johnstown, LLC.  The Authority supplies domestic, commercial and industrial water to the Greater Johnstown Area.\n\n    Chlorine is the only EPA-regulated chemical stored on-site at the Riverside Water Treatment Plant above EPA-threshold quantity.  Approximately 8,000 lbs. of chlorine are stored in four (4) 2,000 lbs. vessels.   As part of the RMP compliance, a worst-case scenario predicated on the release of chlorine gas has been modeled utilizing the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis and RMPComp.  The worst-case release quantity has been determined to be 2,000 lbs. (1 vessel), at a release rate of 200 lbs./minute  for a 10-minute duration.  In this highly unlikely scenario, the affected area would be a 0.9 mile radius from the center of the chlorine room at the water treatment plant.   Because the likelihood of such an occurence taking place is so minute, a more realistic alternative release scenario has also been formulated using the EPA's "

In this alternative situation, Chlorine gas would be released during a transfer hose failure during the connection process of a full tank.  According to the model, approximately 630 lbs. of Chlorine gas would be released at a rate of 10.5 lbs./minute over  a one-hour duration.  The outcome of this type of release is much less extreme than that of the worst-case scenario results.  The affected area is modeled to be a radius of only 0.1 mile, affecting no persons, schools, churches, parks or hospitals.\n\n\n\n"
