The facility is located on State Highway 3214. The facility consists of a plant that manufactures chlorine, caustic, hydrogen and ethylene dichloride. The facility began operation in 1981 and employees 141 full-time employees.\n\n1.  The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source            (' 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Convent, LA plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Convent Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Convent Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Convent Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) incidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 A prevention program to help"

In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of  affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. OxyChem's mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances. \n\nOxyChem's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release: In the event of an accidental release, the Convent Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  OxyChem utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  OxyChem trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Chlorine Emergency Response Team which is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental chlorine release.  OxyChem also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to assistant in all emergencies. In addition, OxyChem works with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  OxyChem has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the St. James Parish Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (CAER).\n\nThe Convent Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, EPA and Louisiana regulations.

The facility has implemented a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in 1991 as an OSHA Star facility under  OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and recertifications as an OSHA Star facility in 1994 and 1998.\n\nOxyChem is an industry leader in the implementation of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association sponsored Responsible Care. Initiative. As part of OxyChem's Responsible Care. efforts, the Convent plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since 1993. The purpose of this group is to share information about  plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, OxyChem established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\nOver the past five years the Convent Plant has received the following safety and environmental awards:\n     \nDATE     AWARD\n\n1994     OxyChem President's Gold Safety Award\n                 For working 12 years without a lost time injury\n1994     Oxy Environmental Merit Award\n                 3 consecutive years of meritorious achievement in environmental\n                 performance\n1994     St. James Parish School Board Award of Merit\n                 For exceptional se"

USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Convent Plant:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - Chlorine\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for chlorine is the failure of one of the largest chlorine storage tanks, which would release 1,200,000 pounds of liquid chlorine in a 10-minute period as mandated by EPA.  It is assumed that the liquid chlorine vaporizes within the 10-minute time period.  The worst case release scenario was evaluated using RMP*COMP (TM).  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance greater than 25 miles before the concentration of chlorine was reduced to below 3 ppm (which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). The U.S. Census indicates that 203,595 people live within this distance from the storage tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance. Environmental receptors are also located within this distance.\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" is the failure of a 1-inch loading hose connected from the liquid chlorine tank car loading header to a rail car releasing 156 lbs of chlorine vapor. The alternative case release scenario was evaluated using RMP*COMP (TM). Assuming a wind speed of 3 meters/sec, a D stability class and urban topography, the chlorine gas cloud would travel 0.31 miles before the chlorine concentration was reduced to below 3 ppm (which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). Modeling this scenario indicates that the endpoint concentration would not leave the site.\n\n3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  \n\n4.
