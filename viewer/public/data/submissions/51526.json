      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSiouxland Energy and Livestock Cooperative (Siouxland Energy)\n\nSiouxland Energy owns and operates an ethanol plant near Sioux City, Iowa.  Siouxland Energy is in the process of undergoing a plant expansion, triggering the need to report information of specific compounds maintained on-site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nSiouxland Energy has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nSiouxland Energy\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nSiouxland Energy ethanol plant is located in Sioux City, Sioux County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia, Chlorine, and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Siouxland Energy has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 4.4 miles, a worst case release of Chlorine would be about 2.6 miles, and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of ammonia, chlorine, and denaturant stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 64,800 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud, the release of all 2,500 pounds of Chlorine creating a toxic cloud, or release of 226,576 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia store"

      "SummaryText": "d on site.  The worst case toxic cloud endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools, and other public receptors are located within this 4.4 mile radius.\n\nFor Chlorine, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all chlorine stored on-site.  The worst case toxic cloud endpoint is approximately 2.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools, and other public receptors are loacted within this 2.6 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Siouxland Energy has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents since the establishment of Siouxland Energy.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nSiouxland Energy ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  A SPCC has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Siouxland Energy 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
