Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTaylor Farms Retail operates a produce processing, shipping and cooling facility in Salinas, CA. Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility. The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nTaylor Farms Retail facility has both fixed and portable refrigeration systems onsite. The fixed system is composed of screw compressors, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, plate frame heat exchangers, evaporative condensers, evaporative cooling coils, and a diffusion tank. Portable refrigeration systems are vacuum tubes, and falling film water chillers. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Safety relief valves protect all pressure vessels and compressors against high-pressure situations. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical room for alarming. A list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration has been dedicated to respond and determine specific responses for any incident. Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\n\nAmmonia refrigeration system is used for vacuum cooling, produce cooling, and water chilling. The total charge for the refrigeration system is approximately 35,000 lb. Refrigeration mechanical room and roof houses screw compressors, pressure vessels and the evaporative condensers that serve as the high side for both the fixed system room coils and the po"

Vacuum tubes and the falling film water chillers are moved to the Taylor Farms Retail  Yuma facility during the company's winter operation between November and April.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms Retail maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. Incident Investigation Program is in place to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point. Monitoring is 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the fixed system are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient. Relief valves on the vacuum tubes will be tied into diffusion tank as well.\n\n4.    Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, ce"

The Hazmat Team Chief is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Hazmat Team Chief will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are required. \n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no release at this facility since its started its operations.\n\n6.    Planned Safety Improvements\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are listed in Appendix G as Hazard Mitigation Recommendations. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n"
