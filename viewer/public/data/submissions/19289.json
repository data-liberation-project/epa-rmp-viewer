THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE HAD NO REPORTABLE RELEASES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN A DEATH, INJURY,  OR EVACUATION OF OUR FACILITIES OR ANY OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES OR EVACUATIONS OR SHELTERING IN PLACE.\n\nTHIS FACILITY IS AN AGRICULTURAL RETAIL BUSINESS WHICH PRIMARILY STORES GRAIN AND SELLS AGRICULTURAL INPUTS TO CROP PRODUCERS FOR CROP ENHANCEMENT.  OUR FACILITY CONSIST OF ONE 30,000 GALLON AND ONE 11,000 GALLON TANK WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 210,000 POUNDS.  THE PLANT IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR FACILITY EACH YEAR AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR  REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 131,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.5  MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 100 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICE.  THEY ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING THE AMMONIA OPERATION.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF THE AMMONIA PLANT.  THEY WILL ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
