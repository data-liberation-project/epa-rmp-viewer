In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Welch Food, Inc. facility is located at 100 N. Portage Street, Westfield, NY. Welch's Westfield Plant is a grape processing and storage facility.  The facility includes but is not limited to processing tanks, piping, , raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, miscellaneous utilities, and two ammonia refrigeration systems that share the same engine room. Also, located at the facility is shipping and receiving docks. \r\n\r\nThe facility has 2 separate ammonia systems and produces and shipped approximately.  The refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000 pound threshold required for our production process and necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Welch Food, Inc. is in the process of implementing numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\r\nThe Welc"
