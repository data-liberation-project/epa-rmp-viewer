This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Brownsville Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur facility's primary activities are treating and disinfecting wastewater and discharging to surface water. We have two regulated substances present at our facility: chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is used for the disinfection of water; sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 8,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide is 8,000 pounds.  To evaluate the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario analyses, we used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance and EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our sationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information: The Robindale Wastewater Plant maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associates with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process (i.e., chlorination), the Robindale Wastewater Treatment Plant m"

      "SummaryText": "aintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining: BPUB has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Operators and maintenance personnel receive training from Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) and Texas Water Utilities Association (TWUA). \n\nMechanical Integrity: The Robindale Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: vent systems, controls and pumps, and monitor systems. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices by TEEX and/or TWUA. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits: The BPUB Environmental Division conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation: Robindale Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All"

The plan includes coordinating with the City of Brownsville to respond to emergencies."
