      "SummaryText": "The Henkel Corporation's Seabrook Facility (formerly the Sovereign Commercial Group), uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable as a reactant at our facility also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling TDI to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our coworkers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle TDI combined with (1) safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures that we use, and (3) the training of our personnel.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Seabrook facility is to produce polyurethane coatings and adhesives, which are shipped to other Sovereign Commercial Group facilities for internal use or warehouse prior to sale,  distributors for warehousing prior to sale or  directly to customers to be used in a variety of applications ranging from floor coatings to medical devices.  TDI is one of the reactants used in the manufacture of these products.  TDI is received by tank truck and stored in an indoor storage tank that is diked to prevent the loss of any material outside of the building should a massive failure occur.  The TDI is pumped to vessels within the same building, where the TDI is mixed with other reactants, solvents and additives to form the finished coating or adhesive. The final product is then pumped into drums or pails for shipment to our customers. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.  TDI is the only substance handled at this facility that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the storage tank is 85000 pounds, but administrative controls including written p"

      "SummaryText": "rocedures and electronic level devices, are in place to limit the maximum amount of TDI stored in the tank to 78,000 pounds. This limit is in place to prevent overfilling and allow for expansion and contraction of the liquid in the tank. \n\nFailure of the TDI storage tank when filled to the maximum inventory would release 78,000 pounds of TDI within the storage room, but with the addition of diking installed in 2000, the TDI would be contained within the storage room.  The storage room is maintained at 80 \u00c2\u00b0F, but during summer hot spells, the room temperature can rise to 100 \u00c2\u00b0F.   The surface area of this containment is 500 square feet.  Because a release at a higher temperature will result in a greater endpoint distance, we assumed the release to be at 100 \u00c2\u00b0F.  It is also assumed that the entire contents of the tank is released as a liquid, forms a 500 square foot pool and evaporates to form a toxic cloud, which disperses downwind.  Using the techniques presented in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to determine the release rate and using a refined model GAUSSIAN PLUME, the distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L is 19 feet. The storage tank and containment area is over 240 feet from our property line in any direction, therefore no toxic concentration of TDI will leave our property.\n\nThe Seabrook facility has a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  These plans are based upon a number of requirements regulated by both OSHA and EPA. The plans emphasize engineering controls where practical and details procedures to follow should a release occur and training requirements for those employees involved. \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of TDI at the Seabrook facility in the past five years.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the requirements in OSHA's Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120).  The Seabrook Facility's emergency response plan"
