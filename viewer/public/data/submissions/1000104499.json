Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP's are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\n\nFive years Accident History:\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned release of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nPRASA has already implemented in Espino Lares Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage, also it was implemented an electronic rotameter to remotely control the chlorine injection.   \n\nAudits: \nThe last compliance audit was conducted on May 3, 2022. The expected date of completion of all findings resulting from this compliance audit is May 31, 2023."

      "SummaryText": "Espino Lares Filtration Plant is located at the State Road PR-124 kilometer 7.9 Espino Abajo Ward, on municipality of Lares Puerto Rico, 00669.  This water filtration plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release:\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Espino Lares Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.  Procedures have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\nEspino Lares Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Warehouse an Distribution Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers. The containers are connected to chlorinators valves from which the chlorine flows \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather condition"
