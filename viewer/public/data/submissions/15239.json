In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our\nLocal Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities\ndeemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, establishments primarily engaged in\noperating county or terminal grain elevators, however, we are also engaged in providing\nagricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for\ndelivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and\nis the subject of this plan.  Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\nthe early spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored\nonly with little if any product transfers taking place.  The Maximum quantity stored has been listed\nearlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary.  Maximum quantity handled at a\ngiven time will be the unloading of a semi-trailer tank.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as need basis with staff present during the receiving and loading\nof product for delivery.  Annual hours for these do not meet the 2080 hour requirement to qualify\nas a full time employee on site; therefore, item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have adequate\nlighting, and are inspected day and night during use, and through out the off season.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest\nAnhydr"

The maximum quantity released\nhas been identified earlier in this program and would effect some residential population.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nWe have not had an actual release of anhydrous ammonia during the last 5 years at this site so\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual, self-closing excess flow, and pull away valves.  Our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used for unloading the\ntransportation tanks.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\n\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the\nAmerican National Standard Institute (ANSI) Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof Anhydrous Ammonia, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard\n29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Additionally, we conduct\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including but not limited to: Excess flow valves,\nBreakaway couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off valves, and Lock outs to prevent tampering\nwhen the site is unattended.  We maintain routine contact with our local fire department and\nemergency response personnel, and have provided and/or participate in safety training exercises\non Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWe have not had a release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years that has caused\ndeath, injury, or significant property damage at the facility.  To our knowledge, we have not\ncaused any offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or\nenvironmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Nebraska Emerge"

We have provided State and Local authorities all\nCommunity Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III\n(EPRA).  Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee\ntraining in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local\nEmergency Planning Committee to ensure that they conform to the community plan.  We actively\nencourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training program by the local fire\ndepartment(s), local emergency response team, hazardous materials responders, community\nplanners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific recommendations for\nimplementation at this time.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\n\n  For additional information, response to questions, facility tours, or comments, please contact Bernard J.
