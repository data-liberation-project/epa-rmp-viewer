      "SummaryText": "Cloverleaf Cold Storage Co. operates a refrigerated warehouse facility at 21755 Cedar Avenue in Lakeville, MN. The facility was completed in the spring of 2004, it is knowen as Cloverleaf Cold Storage of Lakeville. The refrigeration engine room, which contains 5 compressors ranging in size from 250 horse power to 600 horse power is located at the north side of the facility at the east end. The engine room also contains all of the ammonia holding tanks except for the receiver that is outside of the engine room.\n\nA trained refrigeration engineer operates the ammonia refrigeration system. The system is comprised of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps, heat exchangers and condensers. The ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are high and low pressure and level automated shutdown systems. The majority of these systems employ backup alarm systems.  Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to evacuate the facility and allow the St. Paul hazmat team to intervene and bring the situation under control at are request, with assistance from Cloverleaf.  Cloverleaf Cold Storage has participated in emergency exercises with the EPA and LEPC at other locations to improve the safety at their facilities."
