The Distribution Process program brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communication and cooperative emergency planning.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. \n\nBrenntag safety programs are designed to prevent fires, explosions, and accidental chemical releases.  The program requires safety audits, inspection, maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers.  Facility personnel are always encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.\n\nBrenntag maintains health, safety, and environmental manuals, which contain company policies for risk management, training, product stewardship, community outreach, and hazard communication among other topics.  The manuals also include emergency action plans, emergency response plans, and transportation emergency plans.  The facility is in compliance with OSHA regulations.\n\nBrenntag has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Minnesota Emergency Response Committee.\n\nBrenntag continues to improve its safety record by conducting incident investigations and safety compliance audits.  Brenntag also utilizes continuous training on emergency procedures, and participating in outreach activities, which include: educating and training customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.  Brenntag practices continuous training of emergency procedures through regular safety meetings, and all incidents and near misses are thoroughly investigated and reviewed by the Health and Safety personnel and the Safety Committee at each facility."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC facility is a chemical warehouse and distribution facility located and headquartered in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is part of Brenntag North America, Inc.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  Our major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 200 people.\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in St. Paul Minnesota, is a chemical warehousing and distribution facility.  One of the chemicals stored at the facility is Toluene Diisocyanate \u00bf Mixed Isomers (TDI).  The TDI storage process is determined to be Program 1.  The largest TDI cylinder is 205.28 gallons (2,100 lb) capacity.  These cylinders are pressure rated ASME vessels; they are equipped with pressure relief valves; and they are stored in a ventilated room within the warehouse.  A failure of more than one cylinder at a time would be highly unlikely and would not trigger the RMP threshold requirement of 10,000 lbs.  However, for RMP reporting purposes the total volume of 26,000 pounds must be considered.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario for this process assumes a release from a single TDI cylinder, as directed by Mr. Jim Belke of the USEPA.  Containment curbing and ramps were not assumed and the maximum pool size was calculated in accordance with the guidance documents.  The release rate was not reduced for an enclosure even though the process is located inside a building.  A temperature correction was used.  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 10 feet.  The distance to the nearest property line is approximately 87 feet.\n\nIt is the world-wide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.
