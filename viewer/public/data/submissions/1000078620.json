Procedures and training for this process is the responsibility of the contractor\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program\n\n\n\nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility implemented the provisions of the State of Colorado \"Storage and Handling of Agricultural Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the \" Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia\" as published by American National Standards Institute and Compressed Gas Association (ANSI/CGA G-2.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPAFRP  49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility.\n\n"
