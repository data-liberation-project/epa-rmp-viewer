      "SummaryText": "The Fox Metro Water Reclamation District (Fox Metro) is dedicated to the transport and treatment of wastewater in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment.  Protecting the health and safety of Fox Metro employees as well as the general public during wastewater treatment activities is the primary objective.  Fox Metro prides itself in its excellent operating record.  The facility was first constructed in 1929.  In the last 45 years, no accidents have occurred which would put the public or the environment at risk.\r\n\r\nFox Metro developed a safety committee, which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the safety rules and procedures.   This committee meets monthly. The committee is made up of management and labor representatives, which act as a resource for the District.  The safety committee is responsible for accident and injury records, development and implementation of the safety and education program, safety inspections and safety standard compliance.\r\n\r\nFox Metro treats a daily average of 35 million gallons of wastewater with a design average flow of 42 mgd. The general process for treating wastewater utilizes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove pollutants.  First, bar screens and grit chambers remove large debris while primary settling basins permit smaller particulates to settle out from the influent flow stream.  The flow is subsequently mixed with activated sludge (bacteria) which remove organic pollutants through the bacterial metabolism.  The bacteria are then allowed to deposit into secondary settling tanks.  Finally, the flow is passed through cloth filters, disinfected in season, and discharged into the Fox River at levels below the regulatory compliance standards allowed by the NPDES permit.\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was created to address methane only.  The remaining chemicals that are utilized by Fox Metro do not exceed the mandated threshold quantities.  Methane is a flammable gas w"

      "SummaryText": "hich is created through the anaerobic digestion process.  Anaerobic digesters are large tanks where bacterial activities are utilized to decompose organic solids from wastewater.  These organic solids are called sludge.  The process of anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge eliminates pathogenic organisms, reduces the amount of materials that require ultimate disposal, creates a sludge which can be easily dried and utilized for farmland enhancement, and creates gases that can be used as a fuel supply. \r\n\r\nFox Metro operates a Temperature Phased Anaerobic Digestion (TPAD) process for processing the biosolids.  There are four fixed dome anaerobic digesters (M1, M2, M3 and M5) and a fixed dome intermediate storage tank (IS tank).  A fifth digester, M4, is currently utilized for storage, where 3,000 cfm of fresh air is pulled through the tank. Therefore, there is no potential for methane to build up in this tank.  M1 and M2 are used as thermophilic digesters and M3 and M5 are used as mesophilic digesters.  The IS tank is also operated under anaerobic conditions.  All of these processes generate methane.  \r\n\r\nThe digesters, IS tank, and the associated piping store approximately 14,356 pounds of gas and the capacity of the sphere is approximately 6,945 pounds of digester gas.  Therefore, the total maximum amount of digester gas present on site in one day is 21,301 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fox Metro's 2019 digester data, the gas created from the TPAD process varies from digester to digester and throughout the year but is approximately 63.5% methane, 33.5 % carbon dioxide, 1.5% nitrogen and 1.5% water.    This gas is collected from the digesters and used in the boilers or stored in a sphere for later use and the excess gas is burned off by on-site, permitted flares.  \r\n\r\nRMP* Comp, a software modeling program created by the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and"

      "SummaryText": "Cameo team of the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division was utilized for two scenarios: a worst case scenario and an alternative scenario.  Appendix F: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants of the EPA Risk Management Plan Guidance was extensively consulted for determining the modeling scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario modeled was a vapor cloud explosion of all of the methane from the largest vessel, in this case, the sphere.  Instantaneous failure of the sphere could potentially produce a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.20 mile radius.  The modeled alternative scenario was a slower release from the sphere over a ten minute time period and a subsequent explosion.  Failure of the gas sphere would cause a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.10 mile radius.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention Program\r\nThe Release Prevention Program consists mainly of employee health and safety training, preventative maintenance, and strict operating procedures.  Employees are trained immediately upon employment and updated annually thereafter on proper welding and cutting procedures, lock out/tag out procedures, proper lifting, hand safety, fork lift operation, hazard communication, fire extinguisher training, and first aid/CPR.   Preventative maintenance prevents breakdowns, reduces wear, improves efficiency, and extends the life of equipment and structures while enhancing the reliability and dependability of the wastewater treatment equipment.  Strict operating procedures ensure that the proper start up/shut down sequences are utilized when operating equipment.  The IEPA Bureau of Air conducts periodic inspections with regard to the sphere and digesters.  The most recent inspection occurred in January 2019.  No modifications or deficiencies related to the sphere were noted by IEPA for Fox Metro's correction.  The Village of Oswego's Fire Department inspects the sphere periodically with the most recent inspection in Feb"

Additionally, Fox Metro's liability insurance carrier requires a risk inspection as part of the policy compliance with the most recent inspection completed in November 2018.  No problems or deficiencies were noted by the Village of Oswego nor the insurance carrier.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nFox Metro has had no accidental releases of methane in the past five years.  No one either on-site or off-site had been injured in association with the methane, and no emergency evacuations have resulted.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAn emergency response program is in place at Fox Metro in the case that an emergency was to occur.  The employee(s) first aware of the emergency would notify the emergency response center who in turn would immediately notify the appropriate emergency responders (Oswego Fire Department and Kendall County Sheriff's Department).  Select employees at the facility have been assigned duties in the event of an emergency and are trained to fulfill those duties and assist professional emergency responders."
