If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the \"Central Dispatch\", which in turn will notify local law enforcement, fire, and DES/rescue departments and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.  NSA operates as a primary aluminum production operation. NSA uses chlorine, which is a regulated substance, for fluxing which is the act of passing a gas (or gas mixture) through an aluminum melt in order to clean and/or degas the melt. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  Our worst-case scenario for the chlorine process is the failure of two 1-ton storage tanks resulting in a toxic release of chlorine gas inside the chlorine storage building.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is the failure of a 1-ton storage tank resulting in a toxic release of chlorine gas inside the chlorine storage building.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  NSA complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system is designed and maintained in accordance to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the National Chlorine Institute standards. \n\nFive-year accident history.  We have not had an accident due to a reportable release (greater than 10 pounds) involving chlorine causing offsite deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place within the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response pr"
