The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site.  The Allied facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community.  Allied's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the One Plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into 150-pound cylinders and one ton containers.  In addition, chlorine is utilized by Allied to manufacturer 10.5%-15% (by weight) sodium hypochlorite, and sulfur dioxide is utilized to manufacturer 40% (by weight) sodium bisulfite.  The facility includes a sidetrack for unloading 90-ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcars. A production building is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (ton containers) and for sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite production.  All instrument controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcar unloading, cylinder and ton container packaging and sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite production are located in the packaging building.  The facility is staffed during all hours of operations.\n\nBased upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a covered process, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPEC"

      "SummaryText": "IFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Allied accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00b7 Compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29CFR \u00a71910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (40 CFR \u00a768),\n\u00b7 Implementation of the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution Process Code,\n\u00b7 Operator Function Specific and Emergency Response Training,\n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity Program,\n\u00b7 Use of Chlorine Institute and Compressed Gas Association recommended equipment,\n\u00b7 Use of effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators, facility managers and corporate managers,\n\u00b7 Performance of a process hazard analysis,\n\u00b7 Implementation of an internal and external auditing and inspection program.\n\nOperator specific safety steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by emergency response personnel during chemical emergencies to stop releases immediately.  The operators wear escape respirators and eye protection during connection/disconnection of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment.  All employees are required to wear an escape respirator at all times in the facility.  Employees are trained on the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, presence of the gas detectors, equipment design and specifications and proper and safe handling procedures.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo deaths, injuries, evacuations, and/or shelter in place do to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in December 2005.  The plan includes the following elements: \n\n\u00b7 description of chlorine and sulfur dioxide properties,\n\u00b7 recommended first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures,\n\u00b7 a list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located, \n\u00b7 list of onsite and offsite emergency response personnel and contact numbers, \n\u00b7"
