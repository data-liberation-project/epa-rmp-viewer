      "SummaryText": "American Crystal Sugar Company A? Hillsboro, ND\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nRMP Hazard Assessment Information\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2 ) is considered hazardous by EPA standards. The same properties that make SO2 valuable for beet sugar processing, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling this chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community and or environment. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.  \n\n\n\nThe facility stores SO2 in a single, steel, aboveground storage tank located outside at the facility.  Material is delivered to the facility by tanker truck.   SO2 is stored in a 19,800 gallon pressurized tank. Inventory of SO2 held at the facility is a maximum of 239,000 pounds held in the tank along with residual in process piping. Liquid SO2 passes out of the tank, through process piping, and then branches to the process endpoints. Prior to each end use, the SO2 passes through a vaporizer, which transitions it to a gaseous state. It then flows into the process endpoint. Approximately 65% of the SO2 is used in the diffuser water supply and the other 25% is used in the sulfitation of ''thin juice\" and 10% in pulp press water.  Release scenarios were evaluated as part of the Process Hazard Analysis and following plant staff input a Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario were selected for Risk Management Planning.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:  The scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the pressurized AST and complete release of 239,000 lbs of SO2.  Assumption parameters such as release duration (10 minutes), wind speed (1.5m/s) , atmospheric conditions (Stability F), temperature (25 A?C, 77 A?F) , height of the release (0feet) were specified by the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.22).  The release rate of 23,900 lbs./minute was programme"

The RMP Comp scenario calculator determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 18 miles.  The toxic endpoint and potential off site receptors are identified on the attached map.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: The scenario is based on an actual release that was experienced at the facility in June of 2008.  SO2 was being transferred between the storage tank and a contracted tanker truck.  Flexible hose was connected from the delivery truck to the tank pipe.  The flexible transfer line ruptured releasing an estimated 738 lbs of SO2 in a period of 3 minutes.   The truck operator shut the valves to reduce the impact of the hose rupture.  The incident occurred approximately midday with a NW wind of 10 mph, a temperature of 65A?F, 50% humidity, clear with a stability class of D.  The RMP Comp scenario calculator showed that the incident resulted in effecting a 0.3 mile area to its toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint and potential off site receptors are identified on the attached map.\n\n\n\nIt is this facility's intent to uphold industry standards in the design, construction and operation of the facility. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. ACSC is required to and has implemented a Facility Response Plan according to 40 CFR 112. If an emergency was to occur, we have trained personnel and equipment ready for response in the event of a spill of hazardous materials. It is also our policy to notify the Hillsboro Fire Department (via the 911 system), and request that they respond to the emergency if the emergency is beyond our capabilities.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and will all applicable state codes and regulations. ACSC takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes. Using this approach, the design, technol"

Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n\n\n- Maintaining Process Safety Information (PSI): ACSC maintains up-to date technical information about safe operating limits of the processes and associated hazards of the chemicals involved.\n\n- Conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA): ACSC performs technical analysis of the plant's processes in order to anticipate what might go wrong and recommend approached to minimize the possibilities and affects of such occurrences.\n\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): We have written technical and administrative procedures used to operate the plant safety.\n\n-Training: ACSC provides employees with information necessary to ensure safe operation. \n\n- Mechanical Integrity: We ensure proper maintenance of the process equipment on an on-going basis.\n\n- Management of Change (MOC): ACSC analyzes changes in process equipment, procedures and personnel to understand the impact of those changes in the safe operation of our plant.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: We ensure all necessary elements for operating a safe process are in place prior to introducing the hazardous chemical into a A?newA? or modified system.\n\n- Compliance Audits: We conduct periodic evaluation and updating of the process operation to ensure all RMP elements are being applied properly.\n\n- Incident Investigation: ACSC has procedures for investigating th"
