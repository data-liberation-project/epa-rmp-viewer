The methods of production\nrequire the storage of a maximum amount of 103,200 pounds of liquified Anhydrous Ammonia in a\npressurized steel tank that is passivily contained by a cement sump.\n\nAvocet Tungsten, Inc. has developed and uses an ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE\nPROGRAM which includes, but is not limited to, annual chemical safety training, emergency response\nprocedures, community Right-to Know, OSHA - PSM safety for employees and Hazardous Emergemcy\nLeak Procedures ( H.E.L.P.) for Public, Employee and Environmental protection. All of these  programs are ascribed to and implemented by all senior management personnel.\n\nA worst case release scenario was completed using OCA Guidance for AMMONIA REFRIGERATION\n(40 CFR PART 68)  and it was found that there were no Public Receptors within the Toxic Endpoint\nDistance. Because of the isolated rural location of the Facility, Emergency Response by Outside\nAgencies is easily controllable and coordinated. Because of the isolated rural location of the Facility\nresponse time of Outside Agencies are so long that the Emergency Response must be done by the\nFacility's  Trained personnel. Annual training and updating of procedures are completed and certified\nby Senior Management.\n\nAvocet Tungsten, Inc. has never had any accidental releases of ANHYDROUS AMMONIA in the total\ntime period of its operation. The facility has in place the required OSHA - PSM  Program and the Facility\nhas internal and external safety inspections. All Personnel and Emergency Responders on site \nparticipate in Emergency Response Drills conducted at unannounced time periods.\n\nAvocet Tungsten, Inc. is totally commited to the Safety and Protection of Personnel, The Public and The Environment."
