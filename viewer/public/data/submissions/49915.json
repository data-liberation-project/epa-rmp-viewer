Is fully committed to providing a safer more healthful workplace for all employees and surrounding community.   The main objective of our safety program is to prevent an unwanted release of ammonia into locations that could expose employees and others to this serious hazard.  Our approach is based on a systematic evaluation of the entire refrigeration process, training employees on ammonia safety and standard operating procedures.  Merchandise Warehouse is committed to providing safety programs that insure the integrity of our equipment including the design of the system, management of change, routine inspection and incident investigation.  Our quality systems insure continuous improvement through preventive/correction actions.\n\nSenior management commitment of ammonia safety is summarized as follows:\n\n1. Preventive Action \na. Preventive maintenance on refrigeration equipment up to date.\nb. Timely maintenance on repair/replacement items.\n\n2. Education\na. Safety drills including employees and contractors.\nb. Meeting with employees with sign off.\n\n3. Continuous improvement.\na. As regulations change.\nb. As the  infrastructure changes\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.  Stationary"

The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 30,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program. \n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. Through the use of multiple stages (2) of compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of 35F. With the use of low suction booster compressors and provides temperatures of +20F. And +35F. With the use of intermediate suction compressors.  \n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nD.
