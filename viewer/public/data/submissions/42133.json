The facility maintains approximately 142 full time employees. The facility produces and stores dairy products. The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop \"Direct\" type system.\n\nCalifornia Dairies Fresno California facility has developed a risk management program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119) and to enhance an already existing safety and emergency action programs. California Dairies is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. California Dairies staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n California Dairies Fresno California facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Their policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia systems are composed of the following key components:\n \n-Four Compressors\n-One high-pressure receiver\n-One Pump Receiver\n-One liquid ammonia transfer system\n-Three Accumulators\n-Two evaporative condensers\n-One Ice Builder\n-Three Chillers\n-Eleven Air Cooling evaporators \n-Three Milk Storage tanks\n-One automated system control \n\n\nSystem operation cycle begins at the high-pressure receiver where liquid ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a is fed from the receiver to the pump receiver.  At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then pumped to the evaporators where it absorbs heat from the room or product. Vapor is returned to the pump receiver and accumulator from the evaporators where the gas is separated from the liquid and liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver via the liquid ammonia transfer system. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the RMP and CalARP regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (given that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is comprised of interconnected equipment) we used the High Pressure Receiver releasing 6,378 pounds in 10.0 minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, only portions of the Ammonia Refrigeration System are located outside, however no credit was taken for containment.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the RMP and CalARP regulations.  ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm.  The results show that off-site areas will be affected. This WCS is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of an"

For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is 700 pounds.\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm.   The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n- Floor drains in the Engine Room would provide containment for liquid release and therefore minimize the potential for offsite impact.\n- Although most of the ammonia is located in the Engine Room. Conservatively, no credit for enclosure mitigation was taken.\n- Plant personnel, as necessar"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The CalARP Prevention Program elements include:\n- Hazard Review \n- Operating Procedures\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Incident Investigation\n- Compliance Audits \n- Employee Participation\n- Contractors\n- Mechanical Integrity \n- Hot Work\n- Management of Change\n- Trade Secrets\n- Training   \n-  Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n\n Key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan. See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\n\n \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no CalARP/RMP-applicable releases of ammonia at the California Dairies Fresno Facility in at least the past five years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia Dairies has filed a Chemical Inventory Business Emergency Plan with Fresno County and this plan includes:\n-Emergency alarm procedures.\n-Evacuation procedures\n-Safety and health considerations.\n-Notification procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the California Dairies Facility.  These studies include the following:  Hazard Analysis (HA), Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment.  Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will have been implemented by June 30, 2005."
