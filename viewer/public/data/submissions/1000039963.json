      "SummaryText": "Coal Creek Station (CCS) is a lignite-fired electric generation plant, consisting of two 550MW generating units. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the cooling water process. The maximum chlorine storage is 40,000 pounds, with an average daily disinfectant usage of 500 pounds per day.\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored in twenty, one ton containers for use in the cooling water disinfection process.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the containers and injected into the suction of the circulating water pumps.   \n\n\n\nCCS has used the release of a one ton chlorine container as the worst-case release scenario. For an alternate release scenario a gas leak from a one-ton chlorine container connecting piping was used. \n\n\n\nChlorine containers and the chlorination system are located inside the circulating water pumphouse. There has never been an instantaneous chlorine release in CCSA?s 25-year operating history. Automatic shut off valves are installed on the chlorine container when chlorine is being fed from them.  These valves shut off chlorine feed if a chlorine leak is detected. The cooling water process area has a continuous chlorine-monitoring device that will alarm in the facility control room, in the chlorine storage area and the area surrounding the storage building in the event of a chlorine leak. Early detection of a leak will initiate immediate response and mitigation. \n\n\n\nCCS has a Hazardous Material (Hazmat) Team.  Team members are on site 24 hours a day. The Hazmat team has standard operating procedures for response to a chlorine emergency. Annual training and drills are conducted by the HAZMAT team as a demonstration of competency.\n\n\n\n All CCS employees are trained to HAZMAT Awareness Level.   The plant has emergency response, on-site and off-site evacuation and notification procedures.\n\n\n\nCCS has an excellent five-year accident history. No chlorine gas leaks have occurred.During the 5 year period CCS did receive a container that had a small leak in the valve.  This con"

      "SummaryText": "tainer was capped and returned to the vendor.  \n\n\n\nCCS is in compliance with the North Dakota Emergency Response requirements and developed a SARA Site Specific Emergency Response Plan.  That plan is on file at the Local Emergency Planning Commission, State of North Dakota Director of Emergency Response, and with local fire departments. Annually, documentation of hazardous chemicals stored on site is reported to the same agencies and authorities. CCS is in compliance with Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rules. The PSM chlorine plan has been in place since September 1993. The PSM Team meets every three years and following any incident. Changes to procedures and/or process are implemented based upon the team's recommendation. The team continually improves process safety and reduces the potential of a release.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 the Department of Homeland Security inspected CCS to assess and approve planned security measures for chlorine storage.  The plan was approved and all security measures were installed by the end of 2013.  Security measures include controlled access to the storage and process rooms, cameras in the storage area and motion detectors in the storage room.  New security and materials purchasing and receiving procedures have been put in place to comply with DHS requirements. "
