Incidental releases will be handled by plant personnel, while emergency releases will require a response by the Branson Fire Department. \n\n        The Meadows Action Plan details response activities of trained HAZMAT personnel and lines of communication and authority between responders from Police, Fire, and Utilities departments. The plan also describes specific responsibilities of trained individuals, as well as steps of mobilization, mitigation, and types of safety equipment needed. Clean-up procedures and levels of training to perform clean-up are described. Also, included are methods of accident prevention, instructions for evaluation and follow-up meetings to review problems encountered during the response and ways to improve response time and communications in the event of a future incident. The action plan will be exercised as needed so procedures can be updated as necessary. \n\nWe believe this plan to be comprehensive, informative, and adequate."

Should a regulator fail and allow a release, a leak detector will signal automatic cylinders to shutoff system to close the cylinder valves. Employees who handle these hazardous chemicals receive extensive training that includes demonstration, scenario, classroom, and hands on training. \n\n          With the addition of a new dry chlorine scrubber system that was installed 12/12/2023 in the event of a large release of chlorine gas within the chlorine storage room or feed room, the alarm system will trigger the exhaust system in the corresponding room as well as the scrubber system. This process evacuates the released chlorine gas to the scrubber system where it is neutralized  by pellets of sodium thiosulfate and the scrubbed air is released back into the atmosphere. \n\n         As of June 21, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that all facilities which store  chemicals such as chlorine in quantities greater than 2500 pounds, to establish a Risk Management Program. The Risk Management Program for the Meadows Water Treatment Plant includes an Action Plan that will be put into effect in the event of a hazardous chemical release. This plan provides guidelines to assure that hazardous material (HAZMAT) emergencies are handled in a manner consistent with current regulations and safety practices. The plan is intended to cover all releases of hazardous chemicals regardless of size. Although a small spill or leak does not entail the same complex response mechanism as a massive release, it still has the potential to produce localized injury or damage. The intent of this plan is to ensure that all plant personnel approach every HAZMAT incident from an informed perspective. In this way, adequate precautions can be taken to minimize the degree of hazard to our employees and the public. \n\n      During a hazardous material emergency at the plant, a trained supervisor"

      "SummaryText": "The Meadows Water Treatment Plant, located in Branson, MO, is in its 28th year of operation. It is designed to produce five million gallons of high-quality drinking water per day. The facility sets on approximately 8 acres of land that is equal to or higher in elevation than most of the surrounding terrain. The plant is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by experienced, certified operators, under the direction of an Operations Manager.               \n\n \tA chemical storage building and operations building occupy the site along with four settling basins, each with a holding capacity of 500,000 gallons. Chemicals used on site are Polyaluminum Hydroxychloride, and Chlorine gas. Each of these chemicals are potentially hazardous if not handled properly. Polyaluminum Hydroxychloride is used in the treatment process as a coagulant to settle suspended solids in the outside settling basins, prior to filtration. This chemical is kept in a 5000-gallon storage tank which sits in a leak proof containment area. Should the tank ever fail, allowing a spill to occur, the chemical would be confined to the containment area.  Polyaluminum Hydroxychloride is only considered hazardous because of a low pH in its concentrated form and requires minimal safety requirements. The remaining chemicals that is used in the treatment process, requires strict safety practices in handling.  \n\n          Chlorine gas is used for disinfection in the water treatment process. A residual of 1.2 to 1.8 mg/L remains in the finished water leaving the plant. Chlorination is a safe and effective way to prevent bacterial contamination in the water system. However, chlorine in a gas or compressed liquid form has a potential to be extremely hazardous if not handled properly. This chemical is shipped to our facility in 1-ton chlorine gas cylinders. A vacuum system is used to remove the chlorine from the cylinders at a specified rate. Should the system fail, causing loss of vacuum, automatic shutoffs mou"
