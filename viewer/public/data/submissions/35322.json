This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation and maintenance of our processes. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and conatin the release.\nDescription of the staionary source and regulated substances. The Kinder Morgan, Snyder Gas Plant, located near Snyder, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from pipeline gas and liquids. The gas plant has several regulated flamables, such as methane, ethane, and propane. The gas plant also uses or processes chlorine, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfuric acid, however, these substances do not exceed the threshold qauntities.\nHazard assesment results. The worst case scenario associated with a release of flammable material is in program 1 at the Snyder gas plant is a vapor cloud  explosion involving the largest storage tank containing propane. Awriiten procedure is in place to limit the storage capacity to 90% of tank capacity. The total amount of propane released is 274,269 lbs. The maximum distance to the 1- psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.53 miles. No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\nGeneral accident release prevention program/chemical specific prevention steps. The Kinder Morgan, Snyder Gas Plant  provide for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Kinder Morgan also provides a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operayion of the processes and chemical handling instructions.\nFive year accident history. Kinder Morgan, Snyder Gas Plant, has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the last five years. There has been no deaths or injuries reported on or offsite since June 21, 1994. W"

The overall emergency response program the Snyder Gas Plant is coordinated with the Snyder Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The coordination include periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials. The Snyder gas Plant has 24/7 communication with the appropriate LEPC official and emergency response organizations. This provides a means of notifying the public of an accident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\nPlanned changes to improve safety. Kinder Morgan resolves all findings from incidents occurring at the gasplant. If incidents occur, Kinder Morgan will eveluate all possible methods to reduce or eliminate the risk of any occurring in the future. This could involve decreasing process chemicals inventories, change operational procedures, and new revise detection systems, add or modify equipment, increase training requirements."
