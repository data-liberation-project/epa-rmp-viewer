Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Crop Production Services are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia in nurse wagons for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is temporarily stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored is 180,000 pounds.  This facility may store up to 40 nurse wagon tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the maximum allowed capacity of 85% would release the total contents or 5,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a gas in a period of ten minutes.  Company procedures and equipment design standards limit the maximum filling capacity of tanks to 85% of capacity.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 0.32 miles.\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario:  The alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release of 2902 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a period of two minutes from the rupture of a 2 inch pipe or tank fitting.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.31 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:   This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture.  Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.  \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of"

Emergency Response Program:  This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120, however Region 7 EPA deems it not applicable for purposes of this rule.  Emergency planning and community right-to-know information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.  \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
