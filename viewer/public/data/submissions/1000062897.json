Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCovestro LLC is committed to and comply with the requirements of the Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) which emphasize operating in a safe and environmentally correct manner. Management systems are in place to assure all facilities are complying with these principles.  There are Corporate Engineering Standards and Health, Environment and Safety Guidelines which address every aspect of Risk Management from design of intrinsically safe processes to the use of risk assessment, incident tracking and program audits. Covestro LLC was formerly a division of Bayer AG, but is now a separate company and is classified as a subsidiary of BayerAG since Bayer owns a majority of the Covestro stock. Covestro is headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany. The US (country) headquarters for Covestro is located in Pittsburgh, PA.  Covestro LLC has its own company structure, policies and procedures which are consistent with those of the holding company, but are customized to meet local regulations and standards.  Covestro has established guidelines for Responsible Care in Environmental Protection and Safety, which include a Directive for Process and Plant Safety that all Covestro facilities world-wide are expected to follow.  It provides guidance for safe process design and operation.\n\n\n\nIn the US, Covestro LLC is an active member of the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Initiative.  Covestro has implemented all seven codes (Pollution Prevention, Distribution, Product Stewardship, Employee health & Safety, Security: and Community Awareness & Emergency Response) of management practice.  Covestro has a Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Policy which states that it is the company's responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and communities."

Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary activities at the South Charleston facility are the production of Polyols which are used in the manufacture of polyurethanes.  The Polyols that are manufactured are either as Polyether (Flex) Polyols or Polymer Polyols.  The RMP chemicals used in the manufacture of Flex Polyols are propylene oxide and ethylene oxide. The RMP chemical used in the manufacture of Polymer Polyols is acrylonitrile.  Vinylidene chloride (RMP flammable chemical) was previoulsy used in Polymer Polyol manufacture, but is no longer used.  In summary the Covestro South Charleston facility has three (3) RMP listed toxic chemicals. All three RMP toxic chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a s"

Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe South Charleston Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  \n\n\n\nd.   Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences.  Since the initial implementation of the RMP rule there have been no offsite impacts from release of RMP chemicals from the South Charleston manufacturing facility. \n\n\n\ne.  Facility Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe South Charleston Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams from Covestro and the host company that work rotating shifts and straight days.  The goal is to have 3 to 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the South Charleston Fire Department.  The Covestro and the host site emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire the South Charleston Fire department would likely be involved.  The plant also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC).\n\nCommunity warning sirens are placed in multiple places in the Kanawha Valley and there is one within 1"
