The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Updating the RMP pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, Section A? 68.190(b)(4), due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing the storage and associated parcel shipments of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in the facility's D Tank Farm in existing Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-15-21 above the threshold quantity for TDI of 10,000-pounds.  \n\n- Updating the RMP to reflect the consolidation of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) storage at Stolthaven Houston Inc. into IFR Storage Tank P-50-5 from prior, recent VAM storage in Tanks A-15-9, A-15-10, and P-15-41.\n\n- Updating the Worst-Case Release scenarios for TDI storage in D Tank Farm and for VAM storage in P Tank Farm using maximum historical temperature data for the affected tanks.\n\n- Minor RMP data element updates based on October 2009 revisions to the facility's Safety and Health Manual.  \n\n\nA?68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the citizens of the surrounding communities.

The facility currently consists of 148 large above-ground chemical storage tanks, four truck loading/unloading racks (T-3, T-4, T-5, and T-6), three rail car loading/unloading racks (R-1, R-2, and R-3), one barge dock (Barge Dock C), and a finger pier equipped with two separate marine vessel berths (Ship Dock 2/3).  A waste water treatment plant and various air pollution control devices are also located on-site.  Bulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo containers that can include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, rail tank cars, barges, and/or marine parcel tankers (ships).  The received liquid products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Stolthaven Houston Inc. also performs direct transfers between marine vessels and rail tanks cars with no intermediate product storage.  Similarly, land-based intermodal transfers directly between tank trucks, ISO tank containers, and rail tank cars are also performed routinely at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.

Tank D-15-21 is an existing low-pressure tank that is located adjacent to Stolthaven Houston's existing TDI Storage Tank D-15-22.  Tank D-15-21 has a fill-restricted maximum TDI working capacity of 615,672-gallons, or approximately 6,267,541-pounds of TDI.  Note that Tank D-15-21 has been recently modified specifically to handle TDI, including the installation of an activated carbon drum on the Tank D-15-21 flare vapor line, and connecting the existing TDI rail transfer line and the existing TDI marine dock line to Tank D-15-21 to minimize and eliminate connections that must be made for equipment in active TDI service.  \n\nIsopentane, n-Pentane, and iso/normal pentane blends are periodically transloaded directly between land-based transportation containers (i.e. tank trucks, ISO tank containers, and rail tank cars) at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with no intermediate product storage.  \n\nOn April 13, 2009 Stolthaven Houston Inc. commenced the storage and associated transfers of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a RMP regulated toxic substance, in quantities greater than 15,000-pounds in either of two existing 15,000-barrel capacity IFR storage tanks located in the terminal's A Tank Farm (Tanks A-15-9 and A-15-10).  On January 28, 2010 Stolthaven Houston Inc. temporarily consolidated the terminal's existing A Tank Farm VAM storage into Tank P-15-41.  Temporary VAM storage in Tank P-15-41 was necessary until enough VAM product became available to place the current VAM tank, Storage Tank P-50-5, into long-term service with an adequate volume of liquid product to maintain this tank's internal floating roof on-float as required by NSPS Subpart Kb.\n\nStorage Tank P-50-5 is an existing IFR tank at t"

Tank P-50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case VAM release scenario, was subsequently placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.  VAM is received into this tank via barge delivery using a dedicated marine dock line.  Product is then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  VAM may also be transferred periodically directly from barges to rail tank cars with no intermediate storage.\n\nAs a result of the VAM storage project in P Tank Farm, piping modifications were completed in various facility manifolds and at Tank P-50-5 to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM service to the greatest extent possible within the terminal.  A VAM filter-pot was also installed.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P-50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water as-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable liquid storage tanks in close proximity.  Existing portable water delivery systems also remain available should they be needed in the event of an emergency.\n\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was first conducted in December of 2008 and then again in April of 2009 in preparation of receiving this RMP regulated substance into the facility's A Tank Farm in 2009.  Although current facility employees are experienced in the procedures necessary to safely handle VAM, additional safety training related specifically to VAM storage in P Tank Farm was conducted in December of 2009.  Specific topics covered during this employee review of safe VAM handling procedures included, but were not limited to, "
