We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care..  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to  applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling of chlorine.  \nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs to ensure site integrity.  Examples of some such controls include 1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, 2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, 3) limiting inventory in chlorine storage tanks, 4) monitoring vessel and piping pressures.\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves which limit the amount of chemical released, a  fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate personnel protective equipment, and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  Should a release occur, we use a dispersion model - Systematic Approach Fo"

This information is communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant is primarily involved in manufacturing chlorine and other inorganic chemicals. As a part of these manufacturing processes, we produce chlorine and use sulfur dioxide as a feedstock.  They are  substances that are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68). \nFollowing is a brief description of the facility and a list of RMP-regulated processes at our facility.\nThe maximum quantities of these regulated substances that may be present at the plant are 1.2 million pounds of chlorine and 240,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  The RMP regulated processes are the chlorine plant, chlorine rail car loading, sulfur dioxide storage and handling equipment of the sodium hydrosulfite plant.  These processes are Program Level 3.  Vulcan products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout the United Sates and global economies.  Chlorine is sold as a product and is also used as a feedstock in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid.  Common uses of chlorine include  treatment of municipal water supplies, sewage and wastewater. Chlorine is also used to make bleach.  Sulfur dioxide is used as a feedstock in making sodium hydrosulfite.  Our customers use sodium hydrosulfite in the paper industry to bleach paper.  We use a combination of good design practices,  release prevention programs, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  \n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide inf"

There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative.  The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards.  The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.\nFollowing are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit exposure distances.\n\nWorst-case toxic release scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the toxic substances handled by Vulcan is a catastrophic rupture of a storage tank containing chlorine.   In this scenario, the entire contents of a full  chlorine tank, 600,000 lb, is released to the atmosphere over a 10-min period.  Although we have several safety and mitigation features on these storage tanks that would limit the release rate and/or quantity of the release, none of these measures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The chlorine released to the atmosphere  in this scenario travels more than 25 miles before dispersing below the end point of 3 ppm.  Approximately 110,000 people live within 25 miles of the storage tank.  Some of the public and environmental receptors that are located within this distance are as follows:\n\nPublic Receptors:\n\nCounty Parks, Recreation Areas, Boat landings, Hospitals, Shopping Malls, School Systems, Major commercial, office and industrial complexes.\nEnvironmental Receptors:\nState Wildlife Areas, State Fishery Areas, County Wildlife Area, and a National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nAlternative toxic release scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a break in the pipe used for loading chlorine from t"

A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are reviewed by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes. \n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks.

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and (4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Vulcan-Port Edwards plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete, (4) a process hazard analysis has been performed and (5) process hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed and (6) actions required for start up have been completed.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, injuries to employees, the public, or impact the environment"
