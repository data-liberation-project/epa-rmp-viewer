These programs include both Arkema Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as EPA's RMP rule, and the CalARP RMP requirements.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\nArkema Coating Resin facility, located in Torrance, California, operates a latex emulsion manufacturing facility that produces more than 100 million pounds of latex per year.  The water-borne latex produced at this site is utilized by the coatings industry to make latex-based paints, caulks, adhesives, and sealants.  The facility is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of regulated substances listed in the RMP rule above the applicable thresholds.  The facility does not maintain specified quantities of any RMP regulated flammable substances, but does utilize the following RMP regulated toxic substances at levels above threshold limits: \r\n* Vinyl Acetate monomer (VAM) (acetic acid ethenyl ester, CAS 107-13-1) and Aqueous Ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7)\r\nThe facility no long uses acrylonitrile (2-propenenitrile, CAS 108-05-4).  The former acrylonitrile storage tank is used for the storage of vinyl versate, a substance not regulated RMP in the program.  The revisions to the RMP addressed in this 5-year update address the elimination of acrylonitrile as a regulated substance at the facility.\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  EPA defines alternative release scenarios as scenarios that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and that reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  One or more alternative release scenarios are evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.  Un"

RMP*Comp is an electronic tool to make the same calculations performed manually by following the procedures described in EPA's guidance document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April, 1999).  \r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\r\nVAM is stored at the Arkema Terminal facility and is fed by pipeline on an as-needed basis for batch processing during the manufacturing of latex.  Monomer mix tank number 4 (MMT-4) can hold the largest quantity of VAM, 4,500 gallons.  The monomer mixing area is surrounded by a small dike sufficient to contain the contents of a spill of the maximum amount of VAM on-site in a monomer mixing tank.  The dike dimensions are approximately 50 feet by 50 feet by 4 inches deep.   \r\nThe worst-case release of VAM assumes the catastrophic failure of MMT-4.  The worst-case meteorological conditions defined by EPA for the worst-case release are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and a stability class of F (very stable).  For VAM, the worst-case distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 0.7 miles (1,100 meters).\r\nAqueous ammonia will be stored in a 5,000 gallon storage tank with secondary containment.  According to the CalARP Program Regulations, the worst case release scenario analyzed considered the entire 5,000 gallon tank of aqueous ammonia to spill suddenly, flow rapidly into the secondary containment area (~1,500 square feet of area), and immediately form a pool there.  This corresponds to 10,460 pounds of ammonia in the solution.\r\nThe worst-case release of Aqueous ammonia assumes the catastrophic failure of the storage tank.

For Aqueous ammonia, the worst-case distance to the threshold concentration of 0.14 mg/l is 0.4 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative-Release Scenarios\r\nTwo alternative release scenarios for VAM were assessed.  VAM alternative scenario #1 consists of an unconfined release from the three-inch pipeline from the Arkema Terminal to the monomer mix tank area.  The distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 0.2 miles (300 meters) for VAM alternative scenario #1.  VAM alternative scenario #2 assumes an open \u00be-inch drain valve on the discharge side of a pump while transferring VAM to an intermediate mix tank.  The distance to the threshold for VAM alternative scenario 2 is approximately 0.2 miles (300 meters).\r\nA total of 7,100 persons in 2,650 households reside within the VAM worst-case impact distance, based on the 2000 Census data.  The sensitive receptors within 0.7 miles of the facility include schools, parks, and recreational areas.  Other potential receptors include industrial facilities and major commercial facilities.  For the alternative impact distance of 0.2 miles, there are no sensitive receptors.  The estimated population potentially effected by the alternative release scenario is an estimated 100 persons.  \r\nMitigation\r\nThe specific systems to prevent the worst-case and alternative release scenarios of VAM from occurring, as well as mitigate their effects should they occur, include: \r\n* Emergency Shutdown Systems: A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shutdown the pumps and put the transfer valves in a fail-safe position. \r\n* Surveillance: Operations personnel routinely monitor the process and facility perimeters two times per shift.  The facility operates four 12-hour shifts per day, seven days per week. \r\nAqueous ammonia is unloaded from a tank truck via a 2 inch diameter hose that is connected to the integral truck mounted on board feed pump.

The high flow causes high pressure in the hose, resulting in rupture of the hose an ammonia releases into the secondary containment area.  The operator observes the rupture and manually shuts off the control valve on the storage tank and feed pump.  Five minutes elapse between the time the rupture occurs and the spill is stopped.  It is assumed that the feed pump was operating at a flow rate of 40 gallon per minute (gpm) (~84 pounds per minute) when the rupture occurred.  Therefore, 200 gallons of aqueous ammonia is released to the 1500 square foot secondary containment area, and evaporates at a rate determined by its volatilization rate.  This corresponds to 418 pounds of ammonia in the solution.

During procurement of contractor services, the purchasing procedures require the verification of training and if applicable, certifications and licenses. Prior to initiating work at the facility, contractors are required to attend a safety briefing, which is documented and retained. Some contractors are required to work on or near process equipment; therefore, the facility has established procedures to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that are found during their work. At least one Arkema employee is assigned to each contractor. The Arkema employee is responsible for checking the work of each contractor to ensure Arkema procedures are followed. \r\nEmployee Participation \r\nArkema encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management, behavior based safety and accident prevention.  Arkema engages its employees through formal and informal means. The management of change process is an intranet-based workflow process that requires each affected employee (i.e., Acknowledger) to review and acknowledge acceptance of the change or changes.  The Acknowledger has the opportunity to raise concerns prior to finalizing changes at the facility.  At the beginning of"

Employees have access either through Arkema intranet site or on-site library to information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Employees are encouraged to participate in the accident prevention program. The plan is documented and maintained on Arkema intranet site and on-site library. In addition, employees are involved in other aspects of the operation including, but not limited to, periodic inspections, operating procedure creation, and incident investigations.\r\nEpisodic Risk Management System \r\nPeriodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards that could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques. \r\nEquipment Design \r\nVessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements. \r\nIncident Investigation \r\nArkema promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident by reviewing facts and developing corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The production leader is responsible for incident investigations at the facility.  Each shift has an immediate response coordinator responsible for implementing the RMP, including incident investigation.  No incidents occurred in the past 5 years that required incident investigation.\r\nManagement of Change \r\nArkema has a robust system to ensure that modifications to facilities and processes are reviewed by the appropriate technical staff, management, and affected employees (i.e., Acknowledgers).

This process requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. Specifically, the change is only initiated after each employee (reviewer or Acknowledger) has acknowledged his/her review and approval on the proposed change. At this point, the facility is authorized to move forward with implementation of the change. \r\nMechanical Integrity \r\nArkema has well-established practices and procedures to maintain tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, transfer hoses, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) developing written procedures, (2) conducting training, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  A preventative maintenance system (SAP) is used to track work orders, calibration schedules, testing and certification schedules, and completion of all the above. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the facility's process equipment. \r\nOperating Procedures \r\nArkema maintains written procedures that provide detail on how to safely operate a process, including various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained up-to-date by revising them as necessary. \r\nOperational Safety Pro"

This program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements. \r\nLoss Prevention Principles \r\nDesign requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in Loss Prevention Principles (LPP). \r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \r\nArkema conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nArkema conducted an internal audit of the facility on March 24 and 25, 2009.  A PHA was conducted during the audit using Arkema proprietary Reactive Chemical Process Hazard Analysis (RCPHA).  The principal staff performing the RCPHA was Marco Barrueta (Production Leader), Erwin Morfe (Run Plant Engineer), Ronald Weber (Plant EHS/Training), and Yin Ko (Plant Improvement/Projects).  This RCPHA audit is an update to the PHA/Hazard Operability Study (HazOp) performed for the original Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) plan and the RMP.  \r\nThe RCPHA methodology consists of a checklist designed by Arkema for use in internal reactive chemical and PHA audits.  For each question in the checklist, there are columns for a yes/no/not applicable response, a response column, columns to check the work discipline affected, and an action item column.  In addition to the RCPHA questionnaire, there is a second questionnaire that is used for field validation to be used in conjunction with the RCPHA.\r\nThere have been no significant changes to the VAM process at the facility since the preparation of the previous RMP and PHA.

There were no significant findings identified during the RCPHA or during AECOM's review of the RCPHA.  All RCPHA audit action items were entered into Arkema Event and Action Tool (i.e., database) and each item was assigned for follow-up.\r\n\r\nExternal Events Analysis\r\nThe 1999 RMPP seismic assessment of the facility estimated the seismic vulnerability of vessels, piping, and associated equipment and structures containing regulated substances.  In addition, vessels not containing regulated substances but which could impact vessels or piping containing regulated substances during a large earthquake were also evaluated.  The 1999 RMPP seismic review was performed according to the requirements in the 1998 Guidance for CalARP Seismic Assessment.  AECOM reviewed the seismic assessment portion of the RMPP seismic assessment conducted in December 1995, the October 1999 seismic update for the facility, and ENSR's Review of CalARP Seismic Assessment and Walkthrough Findings for the facility conducted in December 2003.  After the review, AECOM conducted a walkthrough at the facility to confirm whether recommended modifications had been completed.\r\nBased on AECOM's review of the recommendations provided in the 1999 seismic assessment, the 2003 seismic update, and a walkthrough of the facility, it appears that the modifications recommended in those assessments have been adequately implemented.  No additional areas of concern were identified during AECOM's walkthrough.  \r\nProcess Safety Information \r\nArkema keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.
