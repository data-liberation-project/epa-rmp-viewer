      "SummaryText": "Bodega Bay Public Utility District (BBPUD) operates a wastewater treatment plant.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant has two 1-ton chlorination units connected to the water system, one as primary and the other as a standby unit, each with a capacity of approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorination facilities are used to disinfect all effluent, and influent raw sewage when necessary to eliminate odors. BBPUD is committed to the prevention and minimization of accidental Release of chlorine.   Chlorine detector is built in the chlorination room of the control building.  To meet their commitment to prevention, BBPUD has implemented a comprehensive EPA Risk Management Plan (EPA RMP) to address regulatory requirements from section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Based on Facility operations and the regulatory requirements, a Program Level 3 Prevention Program has been prepared for the Facility operations. The amount of chlorine stored in wastewater treatment plant is more than the USEPA risk management plan threshold quantity (2,500 pounds).  There has been no reportable release of chlorine at the Facility within the last five years.  In accordance with regulations, BBPUD prepared a worst case and alternative case release scenarios using parameters contained in EPA guidance documents to determine if a catastrophic release of chlorine would migrate from the plant. These analyses revealed that chlorine could potentially migrate from the plant and could potentially pose a threat to the nearby surrounding community.  BBPUD has worked closely with the local and Sonoma County Fire Department planning how to safely handle a potential release of chlorine."
