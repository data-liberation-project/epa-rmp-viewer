      "SummaryText": "New Jersey American Water is New Jersey's largest private water utility, providing drinking water to over 300,000 people.  To disinfect this water New Jersey America Water uses chlorine gas.  In order to protect our neighbors New Jersey American Water has a comprehensive written risk management program in place.  This program addresses all aspects of process safety from operations to emergency response.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey American Water incorporated state of the art safety controls while designing the chlorine system at the Delaware River Regional Water Treatment Plant.  A chlorine scrubber was installed in the chlorine room to neutralize any chlorine gas before it could be released into the atmosphere.  \n\n\n\nNo chlorine related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant of-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nAlthough the plant is designed so that any chemical release is stopped automatically, all associates at New Jersey American Water are trained how to properly handle hazardous substances and respond to emergency situations.  A new associate must first meet the basic job requirements before they are even considered for a job handling hazardous chemicals.  After an individual is accepted into a position they undergo on-the-job and classroom training.  All associates attend annual refresher training to maintain their skills and knowledge.\n\n\n\nStandard operating procedures (SOP's) have been developed for all processes involving chlorine. These procedures are taken directly from manufacturer's equipment manuals or recognized industry standards.  The SOP's describe the normal operation of the equipment, any abnormal conditions and the response to this type of condition in order to bring the equipment back into normal operating parameters.  All associates are trained on the SOP's and review them annually.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive preventive maintenance program exists in order to assure the proper operation of the equipment.  Every pie"

      "SummaryText": "ce of chlorine equipment is included in the PM program.  Equipment is inspected and maintained on a schedule based on manufacturer's recommendations or industry standards.  In the absence of any written recommendations all equipment is inspected on an annual basis.  Associates responsible for maintenance are trained on procedures before they are allowed to perform any work on the equipment.\n\n\n\nA hazard analysis is conducted every 5 years to determine if there are any possible release scenarios for the site.  The analysis evaluates every possible leak location and reviews the protective measures that are in place or could be implemented to prevent such a release.  The hazard analysis is done with individuals who are familiar with the equipment and work with it on a daily basis under the guidance of a Loss Control Manager.  Recommendations are forwarded to the Responsible Manager for implementation.\n\n\n\nAny change in policy, procedures and equipment goes through an exhaustive review before implementation.  This review insures that all aspects of the change are studied and understood before any modification of the system is undertaken.  Corrections are made to SOP's, drawings, emergency response and training programs before the change is implemented to insure that all operations are done properly with the new equipment.  A procedure is also in place to guarantee that there is always an individual in charge of the RMP program in the event of supervisory changes.\n\n\n\nIn the rare event that despite the above procedures there is a leak or release of chlorine, associates are trained in emergency response actions.  Individuals first go to 40 hours of training in emergency response and chemical hazards.  This training includes instruction on the proper personal protective equipment and tools to stop a release.  Associates then attend an 8-hour refresher class every year to maintain skills.  Drills are held annually to insure that the emergency response program works as it is de"

The plan is distributed to the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and they are invited to attend the drills.\n\n\n\nAccident investigation procedures have been developed to determine the root cause of any release and to correct the cause as quickly as possible.  The accident investigation is conducted by the Responsible Manager who will follow-up on any corrective actions necessary.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program is formally audited annually to insure that there are no deviations from the policies and procedures involved in the handling of chlorine.\n\n\n\nThere are no current planned changes to further improve safety at the facility."
