Sections of our SHE policy states that we: \n\n\" are dedicated to and working towards continuous improvement in our operations to prevent pollution; to reduce risk; and to enhance safety, health and environmental performance.\"\n\n\"will evaluate the safety, health, and environmental impacts of new and existing products and operations and will work to reduce adverse impacts.\"\n\n\"will work to continually reduce workplace injuries; incidents with the potential for causing property damage, material loss, or interruption of our business; waste; and releases to the environment.\"\n\n\nFacility Description and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nBetzDearborn Inc., manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals that are primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers, refineries and cooling towers.  Most of our products are water based made by blending several raw materials within a mixing vessel and then packaging into various size containers.  Depending on our customers' need, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000 gallon truckload quantities.  Similarly, the raw materials we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\n\nThe BetzDearborn - Beaumont Plant covers a total of 106 acres of land, of which only about 40 acres is used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities, outdoor material storage and parking lot.  The balance of the property consists of access roads, open lawn and idle areas.\n\nAt the facility, Ethylenediamine (EDA) is a liquid chemical store"

Our products which contain EDA help prevent the release of hydrogen sulfide to the environment when they are added to the manufacturing process in the oil industry.  This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.  We also store Epichlorohydrin, Propylene Oxide and Dimethyamine onsite in tanks.  Each of these products have unique properties used by our customers to help treat their waste or process waters.  Propylene oxide is used as a component of a polymerization inhibitor product used by the chemical industry. The use of such inhibitors help the chemical industry save energy and reduce waste and fouling in the equipment.  Epichlorohydrin (EPI) and Dimethylamine (DMA) are \"building block\" chemicals we use to make some of our other products.  Products made with EPI are used in the paper industry to help equipment function efficiently.  The benefit is the waste reduction.  Products made with DMA are used to clean water in water treatment facilities.\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) And The Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nAt the facility, Epichlorohydrin, Propylene Oxide and Dimethylamine are delivered by railcar.  Our \"Worst Case\" event involves a scenario where a railcar of EPI is lost as an instantaneous release to an uncontained pavement outdoors during material delivery.  Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, the scenario that would have an offsite consequence.  We did not consider any passive controls although these materials are normally stored in protected containment areas when not in transit.

      "SummaryText": "Case\" event involves a scenario where the contents of several drums are lost as an instantaneous release to an uncontained pavement outdoors during material transfer.  Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, this scenario would have an offsite consequence.  Although this material is normally stored in a protected containment area when not in transit, for the purposes of meeting the EPA requirements we did not consider any \"passive\" controls.  We also conservatively viewed that an amount of several drums would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release, even though our facility personnel are capable of responding to mitigate a release of this chemical in various ways.  Because all plant operators are well trained in hazardous chemical handling procedures, forklift operation, and spill response, we think that a release event of this sort is unlikely to occur.\n\n\n\"Alternative Scenarios\" for Epichlorohydrin and Propylene Oxide, events more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" considered release events of where a spill occurs during unloading but the release is terminated by plant operator within 20 minutes.  Mitigation systems were not included in these scenarios.  Using EPA methodology, these scenarios would have an offsite consequence but no public receptors would be involved.  We chose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline. \n\nAlso as an \"Alternative Scenario\", an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" involving Ethylenediamine, we considered a release event of a single drum, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that this scenario would have an offsite consequence but no public receptors would be involved.  We chose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenc"

      "SummaryText": "eline, although we feel an event involving a minor drum puncture of substantially less than a drum quantity would be more likely and would have no offsite consequences.\n\nAs an \"Alternative Scenario\" for Dimethylamine, an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\", we considered a release event of a single tank to be lost as gas, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that this scenario would have an offsite consequence but no public receptors would be involved.  We chose to evaluate this scenario because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of operating procedures, processes for insuring proper training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals, preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases, processes for managing changes in the process and conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur.  The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAt the BetzDearborn - Beaumont Plant we have not had any accidental releases that resulted in significant death, injury, property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage in the past 5 yea"

Also, we intend to evaluate the feasibility of additional fire protection equipment to service RMP regulated processes"
