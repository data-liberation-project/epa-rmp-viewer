Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant are strongly committed to associate, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.   It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass finishing textile fabrics.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The chlorine is used for water and wastewater dechlorination while the sulfur dioxide is used for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 10,000 pounds while sulfur dioxide is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 8,000 pounds.  The Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant has never experienced a release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidential release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensu"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  A PHA/update was conducted on 5/28/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that associates who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Futhermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other associate whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at the Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant.  These reviews will be conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under both PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  A compliance audit is scheduled for 08/25/2005.  These audits will be carried out at least every three years and any corrective action required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a required substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nAssociate Participation\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company associates are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
