(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK management goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Medford Fractionator is one of many facilities operated by ONEOK.  Natural gas liquids (demethanized raw feed) are received at the site from natural gas facilities as feedstock totaling 220,000 barrels per day nominally.  The liquid feed to the facility is split into five product streams in a series of fractionator columns:  E-P Mix, Propane, Isobutane, Normal Butane, and Natural Gasoline.  These five product streams are further purified to remove contaminants such as water and carbon dioxide.  The purity products are stored and distributed to various customers via pipeline.\r\n\r\nPropane, Butane, and Isobutane are stored at the facility in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.).  There are also three flammable mixtures, containing greater than 1% of an RMP substance, which are stored at the facility in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity.  These are Demethanized Raw Feed, EP Mix, and Natural G"

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\r\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are     \r\n        minimized.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated\r\n        with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Medford Fractionator is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.    Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-\tProviding overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.  Additionally, level     \r\n        transmitters and alarms are present on all vessels in order to prevent overfilling.\r\n-\tProviding a Raw Feed Diversion to reduce potential incidents.\r\n-\tTesting of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity\r\n        program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors\r\n        by having a vapor recovery unit and a pilot-lit flare for emergencies. \r\n-\tProviding containment berms around aboveground storage tanks.\r\n-\tInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the facility.\r\n-\tMin"

On February 28, 2012, the facility was plugging and abandoning Well #10 when a release of a mixture containing unknown percentages of propane, ethane, nitrogen and brine occurred.  The plant was shut down and evacuated.  Subsequently, a voluntary evacuation order was issued by the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for the community of Medford and a nursing home and the county jail were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  Additionally, the workover derrick sustained significant damage and the rig required repairs.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe release was intermittent over a 4-day period; however, to be conservative, the release quantity reported in this RMP assumes a continuous discharge.  Weather conditions were variable throughout the duration of the event; those reported in the RMP are representative of the conditions present at the beginning of the event.  Many emergency response officials responded to this release including the Grant County Sheriff, Oklahoma Department of Transportation, Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  Mr. Eric Delgado, Federal Incident Commander for the USEPA, was present as one of the unified incident commanders.  \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Medford Fractionator utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) to conduct emergency response actions.
