Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the \n\nenvironment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed \n\nfor \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most\n\nstringent of the three levels.\n\n\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n\n\n\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n\n       Five-year accident history\n\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\n\n\nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n\n\n\n       It stores toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate and chloroform in excess of the\n\n       threshold quantities\n\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptor\n\n       (residence)\n\n       It does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule\n\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM because PSM does not apply to flammable \n\n       liquids stored in atmospheric tanks which are kept below their normal \n\n       boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration \n\n       [29 CFR 1926.64(a)(1)(ii)(B)].).\n\n\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has\n\nmore than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under\n\n40 CFR 68.115 Delta Terminal Services stores more than the threshold quantity of \n\ntoluene 2, 4-diisocyanate (10,000) and chloroform (20,000 pounds).
