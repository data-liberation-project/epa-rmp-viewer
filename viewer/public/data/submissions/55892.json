(OREG2) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and Minnesota process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. OREG2 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe OREG2 power units are fueled by waste heat from a compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC). The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine. This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm, drives a generator which produces grid compatible power. The motive f1uid then passes through a heat exchanger and enters the cycle a"

After exiting the various heat exchangers, the thermal oil passes through the thermal oil surge tanks and the thermal oil feed pumps, which discharge it into the WHOH. The power from this project is sold to Basin Electric Power Cooperative based in Bismarck, ND.\n\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\n1.    Pump -Work Input\n2.    Boiler -Heat Input\n3.    Turbine -Work Output\n4.     Condenser -Heat Rejection\n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high-pressure liquid, expanding the high-pressure vapor and condensing the low-pressure vapor for reuse. The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572?F. The thermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers. The OREG2 facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\n\nPrimary Activities \n\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The facility is rated at 6000 KW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5100 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air-cooled heat exchangers.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high-pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low-pressure process equipment, the high"

The nominal maximum liquid inventory exists when the facilities are not operating. At that time the energy in the pentane is reduced and most of the inventory is present as a liquid in the liquid recuperator vessels.

The facility is located approximately 1.9 km north-northwest of the community of Garvin in Lyon County, Minnesota.

The alternative case scenario assumes a catastrophic leak from the OEC unit equipment occurs releasing up to 10% of the total OEC system pentane contents. The release would occur at a rate of 41.1585 pounds of pentane over a two-hour duration. The scenario then assumes a flammable liquid pool fire would occur.

The principal methods of accident prevention include equipment design safeguards, written procedures and operator/employee training. Safety systems are present in the facilities and have various methods of operation.\n\nPressure safety systems typically have three levels of degree. The initial degree is an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The next more severe degree is a shutdown of process equipment likely to be causing or exacerbating the condition and an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The third and most severe degree of pressure safety system are pressure safety valves (PSV) which relieve to atmosphere or to larger low pressure systems. Some of these PSV's also have Control Room Alarms.\n\nA combustible gas detection system is present in each of the plants. Sensors are strategically located in each plant.

The policy for emergency response at OREG2 is to mitigate any accident by implementing emergency procedures that have been developed for all known contingencies. Small fires will be contained and mitigated with fire extinguishing equipment and automatic suppression systems. Emergency notification is required for any release or threatened release of a hazardous material which poses a significant present or potential health, safety or environmental hazard.
