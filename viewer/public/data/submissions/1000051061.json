The two (2) most recent reports must be retained.\n\nThe full requirements for compliance audits are stated in 40 CFR Part 68.79.  This facility?s compliance audit procedures are outlined in the Company?s Compliance Program.\n\n\n\nTrade Secrets\n\nAccording to the PSM regulation, employers must make all necessary information available to those persons responsible for compiling PSI, performing PHAs, developing operating procedures, investigating incidents, preparing emergency plans, and conducting compliance audits.  The PSM regulation notes that employers may require persons that receive this information to enter into confidentiality agreements\n\nWith regards to the Risk Management Plan, the RMP regulations provide guidance for the assertion and substantiation of confidential business information.\n\nThe full requirements for trade secrets under PSM are stated in 29 CFR 1910.119 (p).  The full requirements for confidential business information under RMP are stated in 40 CFR 68.151 and 152.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nChesapeake Energy has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Chesapeake policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nChesapeake operates the Smokehouse Compressor Station located in Logan County, West Virginia. Natural Gas enters the facility via inlet pipeline. Gas is routed to the Plant's natural gas compressor where it is compressed and travels through a coalescing filter. The filter removes any entrained oils in the gas stream and routes liquids to the pipeline liquids storage tank for proper disposal. The gas then travels to a refrigerated dew point plant, a metering system and routed to the pipeline.  The collected liquids are routed to three (3) 30,000 gallon storage tanks and taken by truck to Mark West Hydrocarbons.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Station has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Smokehouse Compressor Station. Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nChesapeake and the Smokehouse Compressor Station actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of co"
