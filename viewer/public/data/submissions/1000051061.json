This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Chesapeake policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nChesapeake operates the Smokehouse Compressor Station located in Logan County, West Virginia. Natural Gas enters the facility via inlet pipeline. Gas is routed to the Plant's natural gas compressor where it is compressed and travels through a coalescing filter. The filter removes any entrained oils in the gas stream and routes liquids to the pipeline liquids storage tank for proper disposal. The gas then travels to a refrigerated dew point plant, a metering system and routed to the pipeline.  The collected liquids are routed to three (3) 30,000 gallon storage tanks and taken by truck to Mark West Hydrocarbons.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Station has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Smokehouse Compressor Station. Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nChesapeake and the Smokehouse Compressor Station actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of co"

This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as design basis/configuration information for key process parameters. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems. The plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Station primarily uses the What-If and HAZOP techniques to perform these evaluations.

The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years by the PHA team.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Smokehouse Compressor Station maintains written Operating Procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1)    Initial startup.\n\n(2)    Normal operations.\n\n(3)    Temporary operations.\n\n(4)    Emergency shutdown.\n\n(5)    Emergency operations.\n\n(6)    Normal shutdown.\n\n(7)    Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. \n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.
