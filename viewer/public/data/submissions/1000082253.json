If an accidental release occurs, the facility is prepared to work with the Grand Ridge fire department, LaSalle County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.The storage and handling system consists of storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and alternative case scenario, however, since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations. \n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\" as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n      -   have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n      -   to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, proper"

The facility has:\n\n     -   a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     -   Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Grand Ridge Fire Department and LaSalle County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and the LEPC.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. In 2020, we plan to do maintenance and upgrade the facility to meet new state regulations for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. "
