      "SummaryText": "PROCESS DESCRIPTION - GAF Isocyanurate Foam Process\nRaw chemical materials (MDI, polyol, catalysts, surfactant, fire retardant, minor ingredients, and hydrocarbon blowing agent) are transported to the facility by rail car and/or truck.  For this RMP the railcars will be stored on a rail spur until needed. They will not be hooked up to any piping. Once the site is ready for the chemical, the railcars will be moved approximately 100 yards to the unload area for hookup and unloading. \nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM GAF has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely. The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards. Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials. \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY The GAF Isocyanurate Foam facility in New Columbia, PA is a new facility that started production in January 2022. Therefore, no incidents have happened to date.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN On-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release. Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams. Local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.) are invited to tour the facility and understand the manufacturing process along with locations of chemical storage. SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS As we continue to improve the process, safety improvements will be handled through the MOC process and implemented with employee training."
