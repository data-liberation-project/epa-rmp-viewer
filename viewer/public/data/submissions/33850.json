Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Riverside County Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Skinner Plant has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting plant employees, public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1995 and 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Skinner Plant.

It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented in a timely fashion.\nAs part of this ongoing commitment to chlorine safety, MWDSC will be constructing a facility at Skinner Plant to relocate the chlorine room to a new building outside the Administration Building and to construct a facility for containment of the storage area and scrubbing of both the new chlorine process building and storage containment (to collect and neutralize an accidental chlorine release). This chlorine containment and neutralization project will markedly reduce the accidental release risk to plant employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The project is currently in the final design phase, with construction scheduled to begin Spring 2005 and the facility is expected to be in operation mid-2006."

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for chlorine involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Skinner Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.

      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the R.A. Skinner Filtration Plant (Skinner Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nSkinner Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\u00b7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policie"

Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  Skinner Plant also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1992, 1995, and 1998 detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The 1998 RMP PHA was further reviewed and updated in February 2004 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions were developed in February 2004 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nAn update of the March 1999 CalARP seismic risk assessment was recently completed based on Region 1 LEPC CalARP Seismic Update Guidance and recommendations were provided to Skinner Plant staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSkinner Plant maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the chlorine process.  The Skinner Plant ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  The operating procedures include connection/disconnection for chlorine storage vessel, start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, after"

      "SummaryText": "rine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. Chlorine is received at the Skinner Plant and stored by the unloading platform, located south of the Administration Building.  The chlorine evaporators are in the Evaporator Room and the chlorinators are in the Chorination Room; both rooms are in the Administration Building.  The chlorine storage and use at the Skinner Plant is subject to EPA and CalARP rules, as well as the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe chlorine unloading area, south of the Administration Building is continuously monitored in the control room by chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak sensors are also provided in the chlorine rooms (evaporator and chlorinator rooms) and chlorine vent boxes, located outside the building.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process, is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, in the hallway wall outside the chlorine rooms, and control room. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided on the chlorine unloading platform and outside the chlorine rooms.\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.  In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the control room.  The filtration plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the filtration plant in the event of a power fai"
