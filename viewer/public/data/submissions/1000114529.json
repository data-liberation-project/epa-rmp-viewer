Calumet Princeton Refining, LLC (PRLA) has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of our community, workers and protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in incident prevention, including training personnel, promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release. PRLA has developed and continuously implements its Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) to mitigate potential risks throughout the useful life of its equipment. This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [40 CFR 68.155 (b)]\n\nPRLA operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (i.e., calsol, transformer oils, refrigeration mineral oils, etc.) from 3 types of heavy naphthenic crude oils. The refinery handles several regulated flammables including hydrogen and naphtha. In addition, hydrogen sulfide is produced as a by-product which is a regulated toxic substance and may exist in pure form or, more commonly, as part of mixtures in varying concentrations. \n\nThe refinery operates two (2) covered processes, (1) primary distillation; and (2) hydrocal unit which includes amine and sulfur recovery units. All process units are considered covered due to the plant\u0092s interconnectivity and the co-location of the various processing units.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\nPREVENTION STEPS [40CFR 68.155(c)]\n\nPRLA h"

PRLA adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. The refinery has established programs based on OSHA PSM to evaluate and identify potential risk through management of change, mechanical integrity programs and process hazard assessments. All programs encourage employee participation and engagement, including periodic internal auditing of PRLA processes.  \n\nActions to minimize potential releases are facilitated by trained personnel who participate in the programs; the use of qualified contractors; utilizing controlled operating procedures, pre-start-up safety reviews, and established safe work practices. Incidents are investigated and internal audits have been performed to periodically assess the programs though the facility was not subject to OSHA PSM and EPA RMP. Going forward, compliance audits per regulatory requirements will be conducted. Collectively, incident prevention program activities help prevent potential incident scenarios. In addition to the incident prevention program activities, process safety features exist on many units to help: (1) contain / control a release; (2) quickly detect a release; and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n-\tHydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\n-\tPersonal hydrogen sulfide detectors worn while in the refinery.\n-\tCCTV Cameras\n\nRelease Containment / Control\n-\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n-\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n-\tCurbs or dikes to contain liquid releases\n-\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation\n-\tEmergency shutdown systems and operator alarms\n\nRelease Mitigation\nMitigation equipment includes fire suppression and extinguishing systems, as well"

In addition, personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus), fire suppression and extinguishing systems are available including manual systems throughout all processes. \n\nAdditionally, Calumet maintains internal emergency response teams trained in industrial firefighting, hazardous materials response and technical rescue. These teams are trained in accordance with NFPA and OSHA standards and maintain a presence in the facility 24/7.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY [40 CFR 68.155(d) & 40 CR 68.42(b)]\n\nPRLA continues to strive to minimize the potential for any releases from our plant. During the past five (5) years there has been one (1) significant accidental release per 40 CFR 68.42(a). PRLA personnel responded swiftly to control and contain the release and investigated the incidents to determine root causes and develop corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from occurring. \n\nOn December 18, 2023 at 6:20 PM, a fire occurred on the C-101A recycle compressor in the Hydrocal Unit. The fire occurred when the compressor was lined up to unit pressure of 2,200 psig after maintenance was performed on the compressor. A Hydrocal Unit operator was on top of the compressor decking at the time of the incident and suffered an OSHA-LT injury while escaping the fire. It was quickly extinguished with minimal onsite impact to the affected equipment. This accident did not result in any offsite release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE [40 CFR 68.155 (e)]\n\nPRLA maintains an Emergency Response Plan that is coordinated with the Bossier Parish Fire District 1 to provide a carefully planned and effective response effort. PRLA employees are also trained in emergency response to incidents involving hazardous substances and drills are conducted periodically to ensure that the emergency response teams can mitigate th"
