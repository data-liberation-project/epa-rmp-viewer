Operating procedures, preventive maintenance programs, management of change procedures are examples of systems that are a portion of our daily business operations.  Many of the prevention programs are based on the same principles in both the Resin and Latex units.  However, some of the dates listed in the plan are process specific.  The CPVC Resin unit does not use flammables, thus some of the protection layers in each unit are different.  These differences are indicated below.  In addition, the Process Hazard Analyses for each unit were conducted at different times.  Mechanical Integrity (maintenance) procedures have been implemented across the facility with the same baseline requirements.  Again, with the differences of equipment, there may be specific procedures for each unit.  Incident investigations are completed on a routine basis for minor releases and near misses.  However, the plant has not has not had an incident in the past five years which could have potentially resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.",

      "SummaryText": "BFGoodrich Louisville Plant\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe BFGoodrich Performance Materials plant in Louisville, Kentucky is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in the Rubbertown Area.  The plant began operation in 1942 to produce rubber products for World War II, along with other plants in the surrounding vicinity.  Thus, the name Rubbertown was established.\n\nToday, BFGoodrich Louisville produces over 100 different products that are consumed both in the United States and abroad.  Our Latex products are used in paper coatings, automotive interiors, and nonwoven cloth.  We are the world's largest producer of CPVC Resins and Compounds which are used in plumbing, fire sprinkler, and industrial piping systems.\n\nWe have 164 employees with annual payroll of $11.6 million, paying approximately $768,000 in local and state payroll taxes annually.  Each year we purchase approximately $3.8 million in goods and services, mainly from local suppliers and approximately $2.2 million in utilities.  We pay approximately $220,000 in real estate/property tax and $180,000 in sales taxes. \n\nOur plant uses certain chemicals as raw materials which are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These are vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, which are flammables under the RMP; and chlorine and vinyl acetate, which are toxics under the RMP.  The types of programs recently required by the RMP to prevent serious accidents and to plan contingencies have long been in place at the BFGoodrich Louisville plant.  We understand the relationship between good safety and good business, which is reflected by our exemplary and frequently awarded safety performance.  Nevertheless, we welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as another opportunity to expand dialog with our community.    \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Programs at The Stationary Source      \n\nIt is the policy of the BFGoodrich Louisville plant to conduct our ope"

      "SummaryText": "ident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires each company to include a description of all accidental releases within the last five years which resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage on-site; known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  The BFGoodrich Louisville plant has had no events meeting this criteria.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe BFGoodrich Louisville plant has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lake Dreamland Fire Department, Rubbertown Mutual Aid Association, and other local response agencies.  Plant personnel are trained annually on the plan and new employees are trained prior to working in a process area.  Our emergency response team maintains  24-Hour Hazardous Material Technician certification to mitigate an accidental release.  In addition, the plant maintains a dispersion modeling system which does \"real time\" vapor cloud dispersions and can give indications of affected neighborhoods in the community.\n\n\n\n Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides a detailed prescription for a worst case scenario (WCS).  Under the prescription, we have identified two WCS: one for a toxic material and one for a flammable material.  In both cases, the RMP rule requires that the largest storage vessel experiences a catastrophic failure and releases all inventory within ten minutes.  This scenario would occur under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed.  Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place; we find these scenarios to be highly unlikely.\n\nThe RMP rule also provides a prescription for what should be considered for an alternate release scenario (ARS); however the rule does allow more flexibility when determining these scenarios.   Under the prescription, we have identified three ARS: one for each toxic material (2) and one "

The scenarios we have identified are more credible than those described in the worst case, but are still very unlikely given of protection redundancy and level of training.  The following is a description of our scenarios:\n\nWorst Case Toxic\nThe first scenario involves chlorine, which is considered a toxic gas under the RMP rule.   This scenario involves the loss of the entire inventory of a 180,000 pound railcar over a ten minute period.  The EPA's tabulated dispersion predictions were used to determine the toxic endpoint of this material, which obviously could have a significant off-site impact.  We are unaware of any incident in international history where a railcar vessel has spontaneously ruptured.  Currently, the plant has administrative controls such as procedures and training, which address the proper handling of railcars.\n\nWorst Case Flammable  \nOur second scenario involves releasing the inventory of a 295,000 pound vessel containing vinylidene chloride (VDC).  Vinylidene chloride is a flammable liquid under the RMP rule.  The RMP rule assumes the vessel contents would be released, accumulated in the vicinity of the vessel, ignited, and result in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  We have applied the VCE formula contained in the EPA's guidance and predicted endpoint distances to a one psi overpressure.   There is prevention and mitigation equipment in place to minimize this possibility. The VDC tank is currently in our PSM program and undergoes integrity testing and inspections on a routine basis.  The area is constantly monitored with explosive gas detectors, which are tied into a water suppression system surrounding this vessel.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Chlorine (Toxic Gas)\nThe RMP rule requires an alternate release scenario (ARS) be conducted for each covered toxic material.  The alternate chlorine scenario we have identified is highly unlikely but is more credible than the worst case scenario.   A committee consisting "

The committee evaluated past history and process hazard analysis to identify the most credible scenario.  The committee evaluated multiple potential release scenarios.  Upon further analysis, the group decided that the release from an unloading hose would be the alternative release scenario for chlorine.  \n\nThe following is the scenario description:\nA railcar containing 180,000 pounds of chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas at an ambient temperature of 25C.  The storage pressure is approximately 135 psig.  A 12 ft. long, 1 inch diameter unloading hose connected to the railcar ruptures.  The excess flow valve fails to close completely.  The release is detected and stopped within 30 minutes.  The EPA's tabulated dispersion predictions for alternate release scenarios was used to determine the toxic endpoint.  The plant has established preventive maintenance activities for the unloading hoses including a routine change out program.  In addition, a sophisticated chlorine monitoring system is in place throughout the process area.\n\n\n Alternate Release Scenario - Vinyl Acetate (Toxic Liquid)\nA committee consisting of employees skilled in the operation of the affected process selected this scenario. The committee evaluated past history and process hazard analysis to identify the most credible scenario.  The committee evaluated multiple potential release scenarios.  The committee agreed that the most credible scenario meeting the requirements of the ARS would be the failure of the unloading hose.  \n\nThe following scenario was developed:\nVinyl Acetate is delivered by railcar and transferred to the storage tank in the 300 Series Tank Farm.  During the unloading operation, the fittings are not properly installed.  When the car is pressured to 18 psi. to begin unloading, the connection fails.  The leak would be uncontained and would not be stopped for a minimum of thirty minutes.  T"

Actually, the same unloading station is used for both materials and the procedures are also very similar.  Again, a committee consisting of employees skilled in the operation of the affected process selected this scenario. The committee evaluated past history and process hazard analysis to identify the most credible scenario.  The decision process involved pipe leaks, over pressure of a reactor, storage tank leak, and the failure of the unloading hose.

The leak would be uncontained and would not be stopped for a minimum of thirty minutes.  The release rate would be 4630 lbs/min.  At this time, the release reaches an ignition source and becomes involved in a VCE.
