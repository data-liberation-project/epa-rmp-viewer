This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Nixon Power Plant RMP for the chlorine systems, in particular.  This system is used to feed chlorine to the cooling tower to control biological growth in the tower.  The system consists of one-ton containers, isolation valves, drip legs with heaters, gas feeders, automatic switchover module, ejector/check valve assembly, and vacuum tubing.  The gas feeder has an integral vacuum regulator, rotameter, and rate set valve.  The vacuum regulator uses a spring-opposed diaphragm to maintain a vacuum in the tubing downstream of the gas feeder.  Thus the only components handling chlorine under pressure are upstream of the vacuum regulator (i.e. ton container, isolation valve, drip leg, and vacuum regulator).",

Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Nixon Power Plant RMP for the chlorine systems.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the Nixon Power Plant) and actively participated in a comprehensive hazard review.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by comp"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Nixon Power Plant RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, Colorado Springs Utilities has established and maintains emergency procedures.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Nixon Power Plant is located at 6598 Ray Nixon Road on the Clear Spring Ranch property in Foutain, El Paso County, Colorado.  The facility treats surface water for use in four separate locations:  cooling tower, softener plant, equalization basin, and the zero discharge plant.\n\nThe Nixon Power Plant utilizes chlorine as a disinfecting agent in the treatment of water and is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Nixon Power Plant RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n? Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n? Hazard review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine processes, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n?

Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine from the Nixon Power Plant\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility is included in the Colorado Springs LEPC emergency response program.  In addition, Nixon Power Plant has established and maintains emergency procedures, which includes an evacuation and notification plan.  The goals of the established procedures are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The procedures are routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  Colorado Springs Utilities works closely with the Colorado Springs LEPC and other local industries and agencies to coordinate local response activities.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Nixon Power Plant.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
