The facility's primary operation is the storage and transfer of hydrogen for onsite testing purposes.\n\n\n\n There is one covered RMP process concerning the storage and transfer of liquid and gaseous hydrogen.\n\n Process safety information has been developed for the hydrogen system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards. This information was utilized to develop a HAZOP which will assist management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases. The HAZOP, dated March 2021, is stored on the Chart internal computer network. \n\n\n\nA site-specific training program (Course-5005 Hydrogen Test Site Training) has been created and tracked with our MasterControl training software. All Chart employees working on the hydrogen test site within the classified area will pass the Hydrogen Test Site training course. The training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation, emergency response, safety rules, routine/ nonroutine work authorization, and other pertinent process safety information. This training is periodically reviewed and updated through our training software system, MasterControl.\n\n\n\nA contractor screening process (DSAP-130 Contractor EHS Requirements) has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public. The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience. In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are a"

The risk assessment and job hazard analysis recommendations will be resolved before final permanent installations are complete. Other items to be completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained. The initial startup and normal operating procedures will be fully evaluated as part of the risk assessment and Job hazard analysis to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. \n\n\n\nA site maintenance program is in place to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle Hydrogen is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases. The program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation. This program started November 2021 and is maintained by the Hydrogen Site Manager and updated/stored on the Chart internal computer network.\n\n\n\nApplicable Chart hazardous work training programs, listed below, describe the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to perform hazardous work. The programs reference and coordinate applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. \n\n\n"
