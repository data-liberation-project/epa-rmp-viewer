      "SummaryText": "Huffman Finishing Co, Inc. is a manufacturing facility of socks and hosiery.  In the manufacturing process chlorine is used to bleach socks.  Due to the size of  this operation, 2000 gallons of a 15% chlorine solution is stored for use.  In our analysis a worst case event would put individuals within a 0.9 mile radius of our facilities at risk for exposure to chlorine.  An alternate event would impact a 0.2 mile radius containing it on our property.  To prevent any event from occuring, the overall functioning of the process is inspected weekly.  Hazard reviews, compliance audits and employee training are conducted at designated intervals at our facility.  We are under the juristiction of Caldwell County Emergency Management and have emergency preparedness plans at the facility.  We have and continue to take measures to minimize the risk chemicals contained in this facility may have on the community we work and live in."
