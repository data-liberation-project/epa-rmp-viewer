The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at the facility. Company policy and procedures are strictly followed when handling and storing NH3.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe facility is located on the west side of Radium, Kansas. The primary activity at this location is storage for grain, chemicals and fertilizer. Chemcials and fertilizers are stored for retail sale to producers of agricultural products. The maximum storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at this location is 594,184 pounds, which includes one 30,000 gallon, one 18,000 gallon, one 12,000 gallon bulk storage tanks and 76 portable nurse trailers.\n\n3. The Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 131,070 pounds in a ten minute period or 13,017 pounds per minute with a 1.06 mile endpoint.\nThe alternate release could involve a transfer hose rupture which would result in a release of 1450 pounds per minute in a 2 minute period for a total of 2900 pounds with a .22 mile to endpoint.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\nThe Great Bend Coop recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by State and Federal Agencies and has annual training for the employees. The most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers: An example would be a nurse trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Great Bend policy is not to fill above 85%.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nThe Great Bend Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and a Safety Director. All areas have worked with the County, City and Insurance Loss Control Department for the development "
