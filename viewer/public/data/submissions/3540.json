Propylene Oxide, the only substance on the plant site that is regulated by the RMP rule, is stored in two 30,000 gallon above ground storage tanks.\n\nIn addition to propylene oxide, the Vernon Plant also uses other non-regulated chemicals in it's processes to manufacture a variety of products, both derivatized and non-derivatized, that are sold to a number of different industries which include, but are not limited to, the following;  oil field chemicals, textiles, mining, food, cosmetics and fire fighting industries.\n\nPropylene oxide is an extremely flammable liquid, that if released becomes an immediate fire/explosion hazard.  It is clear and colorless and has an ether like odor to it.  It will react with strong acids, bases, peroxides, anhydrous metal chlorides, copper and its alloys, brass, bronze and other type acetylide forming metals.  Overexposure may cause;  severe eye irritation, irritation to the respiratory tract and other mucous membranes, immediate irritation and blistering of the skin.  This material may be a slight health hazard if ingested in large quantities.  This product has been shown to induce tumors in laboratory animals and is considered by IARC and NTP  to be a potential carcenigen. \n\nSCENARIO DESCRIPTIONS:\n\nWorst Case:\nThis s"

      "SummaryText": "Rhodia Inc. - Vernon, Texas Plant\nPLANT GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe Vernon Plant is located on approximately forty-two acres on the north side of the city of Vernon, Wilbarger County, Texas. The property is bounded on the north by the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe Railway, on the west by Harrison Street, on the south by Sullivan Street, and on the  east by the acreage of private landowners.  This land is in two sections bisected by the Texas Department of Transportation ditch which eventually empties into the Pease River which is located approximately two miles north and east of the plant site.  The North thirty five acres contain all plant processes, storage and waste water treatment facilities.  Runoff water and/or a possible spill is channeled to a nominal 500,000 gallon concrete basin to catch the first flush of possibly contaminated rain water or emergency use water (ie., deluge, fire hydrant/sprinkler, etc.)  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nThe Vernon Plant is required to meet compliance with the Rhodia Inc. Process Hazard Management Program (PHMP).  PHMP meets or exceeds the minimum requirements as listed in 29CFR1910.119 OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard for the same regulated substance - Propylene Oxide - that is also covered by the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 (r) or as more commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program.\n\nThe Vernon Plant conducts annual self-assessments (audits) of the PHMP and develops action plans to ensure prompt correction to any deficiencies noted during these self-assessments.\n\nRhodia's PHMP includes the following 16 elements:\n\n               1.  Unit Safety Files\n               2.  Employee Participation \n               3.  Process Safety Information for Chemicals\n               4.

      "SummaryText": "cenario assumes a rupture to a fully loaded 30,000 gallon propylene oxide storage tank, resulting in 185,200 pounds of propylene oxide being released suddenly and forming a pool which will evaporate over a period of about 2 hours and 35 minutes.  This scenario takes into cosideration that the winds are from the north and relatively calm at 3.4 mph, resulting in the release end point of concern (ERPG-2) going out approximately 0.84 miles from the plant (this is according to acceptable predictive modeling using PHAST software).  Utilizing a semi-circle drawn on a USG map of Wilbarger County and the City of Vernon and using demographic data supplied by the City of Vernon Manager it was determined that approximately 1,135 people could be affected by this worst case scenario.  Shive Elementary School, several businesses and U.S. Highway 287 also fall within this area.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:\nThis scernario envisions a transport truck bumping into the plant's overhead transfer pipe rack, which is located between the storage tank area and the processing unit that consumes the propylene oxide, breaking the pipe that delivers propylene oxide from the storage tank to the process, resulting in approximately 29,160 pounds being released from the 2 inch diameter pipe over a time period of 60 minutes.  This scenario takes into consideration that the wind is from the north at 12 mph resulting in the release end point of concern (ERPG-2) going out 0.13 miles fron the propylene oxide storage tanks (this is according to acceptable predictive modeling using PHAST software).  Utilizing the same USG map and drawing a semi-circle out from the leak source to the south (toward Vernon), it was determined that the release end point of concern (ERPG-2) would be confined within the plant fence line and would likely not affect the public population.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PROPYLENE OXIDE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nManagement at the Vernon Plant is confident tha"
