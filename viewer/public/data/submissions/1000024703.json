The facility was put into operation in November of 2001 and is permitted.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is located outside.  Cold Room evaporators are located inside; however, their associated valves and piping are located on the roof.  The facility was expanded in 2004 according to the codes and standards in effect at that time.\r\n\r\nA portion of the ammonia equipment is portable and is moved on and off site annually as needed for the local produce season.  The interconnecting piping between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Additionally some vessels and the Cold Room evaporators are permanently mounted.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nACS's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is very similar to OSHA's PSM Program.  The Prevention Program implemented by ACS is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\r\n\r\nKey Objectives of ACS's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Chapter).\r\n2. Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system (Process Hazard Analysis-PHA).  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g. earthquakes).  Safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by ACS (addressed under PHA chapter).  The PHA was updated and revalidated in November 2011, by a team representing management, engineering, operations and maintenance.\r\n3. Written procedures (SOP's) and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained, and how to investigate accidental releases or a near miss (addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity,"

ACS certifies operators following completion of operator training and ACS's confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned (addressed under Training chapter). ACS' training program is augmented with a highly qualified vendor that is a RETA-Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator (CIRO).  ACS employees have also completed RETA training.\r\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Program (e.g. PHA study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  Second, all ACS employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility are to receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities are to improve the overall safety of the employees (both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter).\r\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a PHA, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by ACS's Management of Change Procedure.  If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, ACS has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, an ACS Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical cha"

(These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review).\r\n7. Verification of ACS's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and RMP) has been implemented and properly documented by ACS personnel.  ACS has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings which the audit may find (addressed under Compliance Audits).\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAmmonia-specific release prevention measures include:\r\n\r\n-  Automatic Cutouts and Isolation Valves:  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards.  Refrigerating equipment includes automated cut-outs and isolation valves.  The cut-outs are designed to shut down equipment prior to out-of-tolerance conditions being met.  Isolation valves would help limit the impact of a release scenario.\r\n-  Monitoring System:  The refrigeration system is equipped with ammonia sensors and an independently monitored alarm system.\r\n-  Ammonia Diffusion System:  Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) are piped to an ammonia-water diffusion system.  If a PRV were to operate due to an over-pressure situation, the ammonia would be captured in the water tank.\r\n-   Self-closing valves are installed at process oil draining points\r\n-   Refrigerating equipment is protected via barriers and equipment placement (siting) practices\r\n-  Ammonia storage is protected with an evaporative cooling system (reduce temperature and pressure during very hot weather).\r\n-  Security Program:  ACS has established a comprehensive food safety program that includes provisions for security, including closed-circuit television (CCTV's) and monitoring.

There is no data to report.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nACS's Emergency Response Program is described within the RMP /PSM Manual.  An Emergency Action Plan has been established for the facility.  This plan includes planned activities and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.  The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training.  The facility emergency plan is reviewed and appropriate updates submitted annually to the AZ State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Yuma County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City of Yuma Fire Department.  The City Fire Department has been involved with the facility since its opening (via the permitting process) and makes periodic visits.  Coordination with these Agencies is accomplished in this way.  ACS is also a co-sponsor of the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day.  This is an annual event that promotes safety, training and a strong working relationship between Regulatory Agencies, the local Ammonia Refrigeration Industry and the Public.     \r\n\r\nUnder ACS's Emergency Response policy, ACS employees who have been trained as First Responder-Awareness may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  ACS will evacuate the affected area, begin notification process, and rely on qualified responders (e.g., the fire department, portable ammonia equipment supplier and/or refrigeration contractor).\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety are achieved through the continued implemen"

The PHA revalidation study team recently developed new recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.  Key recommendations identified during the study included:\r\n\r\n-  Confirm lockouts;\r\n-  Check water supply locks;\r\n-  Tag critical piping with warning labels;\r\n-  Evaluate certain piping changes to improve safety;\r\n-  Validate seasonal traffic patterns and barriers;\r\n-  Confirm equalizing valve(s);\r\n-  Replace/upgrade certain valves;\r\n-  Check R24 for bearing distress;\r\n-  Confirm oil return loop safety (two-stage Renco);\r\n-  Critical Item Inspection for Room Evaporators.\r\n\r\nACS has developed a schedule to document the implementation of the recommendations.

The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study, procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.  The OCA was modified in the cycle due to newer versions of modeling software, and slightly different parameters.  \r\n\r\nACS has adopted an overall Non-responding facility policy; employees are to notify and evacuate in the event of an emergency situation.  ACS has performed coordination activities with the local Fire Department, which inspects the facility on a periodic basis.
