This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Elloree Fire Department and the Orangeburg County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 30 is dry and cold storage distribution Center located in Elloree, South Carolina.  The Center is primarily responsible for storage, processing and resourcing Food Lion grocery stores. The Center is located in the rural area of the city of Elloree, SC.  \n\n\n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity and is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The systems purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our product. Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. Food Lion Distribution Center # 30 is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910."

The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Release Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 30 has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Food Lion Distribution Center # 30 as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Food Lion Distribution Center # 30 emergency response procedures, Food Lion Distribution Center # 30 has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 30 aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.
