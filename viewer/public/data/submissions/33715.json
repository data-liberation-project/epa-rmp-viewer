      "SummaryText": "The Supervalu - Pittsburgh Distribution business is grocery warehousing and distribution to client grocery stores.  This building complex includes a Dry Grocery/Dairy Warehouse and a Perishable Warehouse.  Both buildings are expansive, and both contain ammonia refrigeration systems, but only the Perishible Warehouse system contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  There are no likely events which might cause simultaneous catastrophic releases from both facilities simultaneously.\n\nThe facility has an active OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Access to the ammonia refrigeration process is restricted to only a select few, well-trained and specifically authorized employees.  The compressors and major pressure vessels are housed within a designated mechanical equipment room.  The facility consists of warehousing freezers and product coolers which are maintained at various temperatures, from -20F degrees to +45F degrees.  All of the freezer piping and equipment is located above the roof.  Piping for the coolers, as well as the air cooling units, are located within the cooler spaces.  In 2004, the facility embarked on a multi-year renovation plan which will eventually relocate all of the ammonia piping and point-of-use shutoff valves to the roof, for safety and accessibility improvements.  Piping which is located within the spaces has been susceptable to inadvertent contact from product handling fork lift trucks.\n\nA worst-case scenario release of ammonia from this process would have off-site consequences.  However, all of the more-likely release scenarios would have consequences more or less restricted to the Supervalu property.  Emergency shutdown procedures and process control schemes have been developend and implemented which are readily available and operable:  these protective measures have been provided to accellerate the ability to control a release.\n\nThe process and its major components are inspected frequently.  Operating systems are continuously monitored by"

      "SummaryText": "a computerized system with integral alarms which notify process operators of an upset.  The readily-distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the inhabited areas of the warehouse of any accidental releases that even the slightest leak has occurred.  All of the areas which contain ammonia piping and equipment are readily ventilated, with either fixed or portable high-volume exhaust fans.\n\nNo reportable releases or ammonia-related injuries have occurred at the Perishable Building within the past five years.\n\nThe Westmoreland County LEPC has included the Supervalu facility in the community emergency plan for many years.  Each year, the facility interacts with representatives from the LEPC for updates of the plan elements.  The adjoining Hempfield Township Fire Department maintains a successful HAZMAT squad which is constantly available to assist in the event of a catastrophy.  In 1999, Supervalu - Pittsburgh adopted the INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA, for preparing and implementing its on-site Emergency Action and Response Plan.  Under this plan, four key managers will become involved immediately upon the identification of a significant (non-incidental) releases and their duties will be as follows:  (a) coordination of and direction to onsite and external responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\n\nSupervalu - Pittsburgh continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it.  Recent improvements include the installation of state-of-the-art leak detection devices, improved access to safety shutoff valves and electrical controls, and piping/valve combinations which permit the rapid pressure reduction in piping and vessels in the event of releases."
