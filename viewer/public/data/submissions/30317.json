They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  The Metropolitan Council's Seneca Wastewater Treatment Plant (Seneca Plant) stores chemicals that it uses in its daily operations. The facility currently uses chlorine stored in up to sixteen 1-ton containers and sulfur dioxide in stored in up to eight 1-ton containers.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater and the sulfur dioxide is used to remove residual chlorine, or dechlorinate the treated wastewater to protect organisms in the river when it is discharged. \n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are non-explosive and non-flammable. However, they support combustion under some circumstances. They are both respiratory irritants, and if accidentally released into the environment, exposure through inhalation or through eye or skin contact can pose a health risk.  As a precaution, the Seneca Plant has special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Council takes its safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as providing the environment with safe disinfected water.  The following document describes the steps taken every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 and codified in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 (commonly cited at 40 CFR Part 68).  The Risk Management Program requires facilities that use certain substances above certain quantity "

This RMP document summarizes our existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the environment. The Seneca Plant has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  To date, the plant has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. No chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred at the Seneca Plant since the use of chlorine disinfection began in 1972.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Seneca Plant\n\n\n\nThe Seneca Plant, operating since 1972, is located at 3750 Plant Road in Eagan, Minnesota.  Wastewater from Burnsville, Eagan, Savage, and Bloomington is treated at the Seneca Plant and discharged into the Minnesota River.  The wastewater treatment process includes preliminary screening, primary settling and treatment, secondary treatment and clarification, chlorination and dechlorination, and oxygen injection (if necessary) before final discharge.  The Seneca Plant treats approximately 25 million gallons of wastewater per day. The Seneca Plant has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from 1-ton chlorine containers and a dechlorination system that uses sulfur dioxide gas fed from 1-ton sulfur dioxide containers.  \n\n\n\nThe chemical vendor delivers 1-ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers to the plant.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn directly from the 1-ton containers and delivered to the wastewater chl"

The Seneca Plant uses state-of-the-art process equipment to maximize the safety for plant staff and the community at large.  Some of the specific features are as follows.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination and dechlorination rooms.  Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant as well as a red flashing warning light on the storage building. The alarms also sound at the central and local control panels.  The leak alarms are tested weekly. \n\nOther system alarms include low vacuum at the chlorinator or sulfonator, and low injector water pressure. Vacuum regulators are used on the gas piping so that chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas is delivered under vacuum.  If a leak were to occur on this piping, outside air would be drawn into the piping rather than chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas being forced out of the piping. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas are enclosed in a building.  The building is equipped with an emergency ventilation system that activates a scrubber when either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak detector detects chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the room.  Chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks are treated in the scrubber and cleaned gas is discharged to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is sized to treat the entire contents of a 1-ton chlorine or sulfur dioxide container.  \n\n\n\nEmergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building along with smoke alarms. \n\nThe Seneca Plant's water discharge permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) only requires disinfection from April 1 through October 31.  During the rest of the year chlorine usage is significantly reduced, all of the sulfur dioxide is removed from the plant, and a complete preventative maintenance program is adminis"

The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment/Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public surrounding the facility. For chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. As required by the regulations, the Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case.\" \n\n\n\n Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe participation of the Seneca Plant staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\n\n\n\nSeneca Plant st"

Another way that the Seneca Plant staff participated in the development of the RMP/PSM was the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below. All staff receive RMP/PSM awareness training that instruct them on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs.  Staff who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM processes are trained in how to safely maintain and operate the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of the RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine or sulfur dioxide process areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program. All the required process safety information was compiled as stated in the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information was used by Seneca Plant staff to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine, and sulfur dioxide processes.\n\n\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of plant staff familiar with process operation and maintenance conducted the chlorine and sulfur dioxide PHAs. The PHA was done using a combination of \"What-If\" and \"Checklist\" methods.

Program effectiveness is evaluated with each triennial audit and improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are initiated if necessary.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes have been developed as part of the RPM/PSM plan. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\n\n\n\nThe detailed operating procedures include chlorine and sulfur dioxide loading and unloading, startup, shutdown and normal operating procedures. The procedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address potential hazardous situations that could occur and how to correct them.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAn effective RMP/PSM training program can significantly reduce the potential for accidental release incidents. Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process.

In addition, plant staff must make contractors aware of the applicable elements of its emergency response plan. The Seneca Plant staff and MCES Support Services project managers must evaluate contractors' safety programs and select only those that can perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility or the surrounding public. \n\n\n\nBefore allowing a contractor to work on or adjacent to the chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes, the project manager and the plant staff must obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs. When a contract involving work on or adjacent to the chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes is to be bid, the bidding procedures must ensure that contractor safety management requirements are met. If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the plant's RMP/PSM plan requirements must be conducted before work begins. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RMP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes that necessitate a change in the process safety information.

This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed. The Pre-startup Safety Review Form must be authorized before startup.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against an accidental release. The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\n\n\n\nThe Seneca Plant maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lockout/tagout or confined space entry provisions are applicable. The staff that perform maintenance tasks are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.
