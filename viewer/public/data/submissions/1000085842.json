      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe City of Anson, Texas, operates the Anson Water Treatment Plant (WTP). The WTP is rated at 2.0 million gallons per day and provides potable water to residents within the City and nearby areas. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process. In order to meet the demand and accommodate supply shipments, twenty-two (22) 150-pound chlorine cylinders will be stored onsite at any one time. However, only two cylinders are used in the disinfection process at any one time. Because of the quantity of chlorine planned to be stored onsite and because of the potential to impact offsite residents in case of a chlorine release, the City developed has developed a Risk Management Program. The City approached the engineering firm of Jacob Martin, LLC for assistance in developing a Risk Management Program (Program) and in creating a Risk Management Plan to document these efforts.\n\n\n\nAnson is committed to minimizing and preventing accidental releases of chlorine from the WTP. The preparation of a Program will assist in these efforts. A Management System has been established to ensure that the Program is implemented correctly and kept up to date. The Waterworks Superintendent will have the overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Program.\n\n\n\nAs part of the requirements for the Risk Management Program, a Hazard Assessment was conducted that evaluated a worst-case chlorine release scenario and an alternate release scenario. The worst-case release scenario involved the release of the entire contents of a 150- pound cylinder over a 10-minute period. The distance to the toxic endpoint was 0.4 miles, as determined by the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis. No passive mitigation measures were used. The potential number of offsite residents affected by this scenario is 420. The alternate release scenario was determined to be a faulty connection to a 150- pound cylinder. The Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Prog"

      "SummaryText": "ram for Water Treatment Plants, published by the American Water Works Association, was used to determine a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.09 miles. For this scenario,  people could be potentially affected.\n\n\n\nA Prevention Program was also established and expands upon the current practices already in- place at the WTP. Written operating procedures have been developed and are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work alone. Operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine system are documented and addressed. In addition, the operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either onsite or offsite, within the previous five (5) years. As part of the Program, the operators will periodically perform compliance audits and incident investigations, when necessary. The Anson WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per OSHA 29 CFR1910.38 and also with applicable fire code and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute. Due to the lack of sufficient resources, the WTP has developed an emergency action plan and has coordinated with the Anson Volunteer Fire Department to provide emergency response should a chlorine release occur. Employees are trained to evacuate the facility and to notify the Fire Department as soon as possible. The Volunteer Fire Department will oversee response procedures, including the evacuation of surrounding residents. In order to increase the effectiveness of the emergency action plan, it is recommended that the Anson WTP consider installing chlorine leak detection equipment. This equipment can alert both the operations staff and the Fire Department should a sustained chlorine leak occur, thereby decreasing response time.\n\n"
