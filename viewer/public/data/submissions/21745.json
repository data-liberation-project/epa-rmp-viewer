This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Henry Complex trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the Henry Complex, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n     The Henry Complex consists of two processes, Henry Processing / Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) Fractionation Area and Henry Product Storage Area. The Complex location is 5624 Aristide Road near Henry, Louisiana.  \n\n     It should be noted that the Henry Product Storage Area is no longer being used for product storage and the Henry Processing / NGL Fractionation Area is no longer processing gas and/or NGL fractionation.  It should also be noted that there are no immediate plans to return either of these processes to their original operational service.  In its current state, the Henry Processing / NGL Fractionation Area provides (1) condensate/free liquid removal and dehydration of natural gas prior to re-delivery to transmission pipeline systems, and (2) Y-grade NGL product handling and delivery services into NGL transmission pipeline systems.  The Henry Product Storage Area is not being used to store any new products. However, for the purpose of this RMPlan submittal, the inventory calculations and the off-site consequence analyses were based on the entire Henry Complex being in full operational service.  \n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n     The worst-case"

      "SummaryText": " scenario (WCS) for the Henry Complex is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of Normal Butane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 1,500,000 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, forming a vapor cloud, igniting and exploding - creating a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.9 miles. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n     The alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the Henry Complex is a 1\" nozzle on a propane storage tank detaching, and causing a release of pressurized propane liquid to the atmosphere at a rate of 475 pounds per minute.  This particular ARS is assumed to last for 10 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, fire monitor cooling water and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vapor is accidentally ignited - causing a vapor cloud fire (VCF).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the Lower Flammability Limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 mile.  With a radius of 0.1 miles, this ARS would extend outside of the boundary of the Henry Complex possibly impacting an industrial area.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n     The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Henry Complex.  The above referenced processes at the Henry Complex are regu"

Because RMP accident prevention requirements for these processes are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the Henry Complex.\n \nEmployee Participation\n \n     The Henry Complex encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance procedures. Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment.  \n \n     Employees have access to all information created as part of the Henry Complex's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the Henry Complex.  This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n \n     In addition, the Henry Complex has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the Henry Complex, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and Henry Complex management.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n \n     The Henry Complex keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

For specific process areas, the Henry Complex has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures. The Henry Complex maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n     The Henry Complex also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n     The Henry Complex has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes that are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \n     The Henry Complex uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs.  These PHAs address (1) facility siting, (2) human factors, (3) qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel, and (4) one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the p"

This PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \n     The PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of additional prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n \n     The Henry Complex periodically revalidates these PHAs.  These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities.  The recommendations from these revalidated PHAs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures\n \n     The Henry Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTraining\n \n     To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Henry Complex has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New operational employees receive training on the Henry Complex's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; lockout/tagout, management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.  \n \nContractors\n \n     The Henry Complex uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Contractors working within the Henry Complex are provided with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency procedure requirements, and (4) site-specific applicable safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Henry Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor. Henry Complex personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n \nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \n     The Henry Complex conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.
