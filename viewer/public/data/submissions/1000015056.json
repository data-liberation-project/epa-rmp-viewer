All pressure relief valves for the fixed system are tied in with diffusion tanks to mitigate a high pressure release incident. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.\n A thorough examination of the system that included a \"What If\" hazard analysis, was performed in accordance with update requirements.\n\nSafety and equipment operational training will be conducted at a minimum at least once a year. Training topics will include (1) equipment operational procedures, (2) emergency response procedures, (3) a review of the Risk Management Plan, (4) a review of the Business Response Plan, and (5) evacuation procedures. \n\nRefrigeration equipment will be inspected and reviewed regularly and as new equipment becomes operational onsite.

Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\nTaylor Farm Food Services facility has fixed and portable refrigeration system onsite. Fixed system is composed of pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, plate frame heat exchangers, falling film water chillers, evaporative cooling coils, portable refrigeration trailers and diffusion tank. Refrigeration trailers contain compressors, vessels, vacuum tube coils, and evaporative condensers. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All the pressure vessels and the compressors are protected by safety relief valves against high pressure situations.  There is are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\nAmmonia refrigeration system is used for produce precooling, storage and process room cooling and water chilling operations. Taylor Farms Retail Services purchased the facility in 2008 and replaced/modified  some pressure vessels and added process chillers.  The total charge for the refrigeration system is approximately 25,000 LBS. \nAnhydrous"

      "SummaryText": " ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. \n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nTaylor Farms Food Services maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  Incident Investigation program is in place to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release. \nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms.  Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day. Most relief valves at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4.    Emergency Response Program\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The Hazmat Team Chief is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The Hazmat Team Chief will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are req"

All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.  Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n"
