To ensure the safety of the public, Distribution Center personnel, and the environment, the Distribution Center has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Distribution Center's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the Bellevue Distribution Center\n\nThe Bellevue Distribution Center operates several refrigerated warehouses and freezers.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the Bellevue Distribution Center.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages:  Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation.\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process:  the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle.  Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor.  By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Bellevue Distribution Center which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritati"
