      "SummaryText": "Fox River Valley Ethanol, LLC (FRVE) is primarily a producer of fuel ethanol; secondary products include dried distillers grains, wet distillers grain, liquefied carbon dioxide, corn syrup and corn oil. FRVE is committed to operating the facility in a safe manner for the sake of both the employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nFRVE has one chemical product that are required to be included in this Risk Management Plan: aqueous ammonia.  Natural gasoline that is used as a denaturant for ethanol is also stored onsite at quantities above the reporting threshold, however the NFPA flammability rating is a 3, exempting it from reporting.  FRVE has decided to preemptively file for the denaturant as a best management practice.  Aqueous ammonia 61.6% by weight, is stored in a 10,000 gallon tank.  The tank is located in containment sufficient to contain the entire tank volume.  The tank is equipped with a vacuum/pressure breather valve and pressure safety valve.  Level indicators and level gauges are installed at the load in station. A high level alarm is also installed in the tank and monitored at the DCS. Procedures require that plant staff monitor transfers between delivery trucks and the storage tank.\n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is used to denature the fuel grade ethanol in concentrations up to 2.5%. The denaturant is stored in two tanks; the first holds 24,500 gallons while the second holds 12,000 gallons. The denaturant tanks are stored in a secondary containment unit that will hold the contents of the largest tank. Pressure safety valves are installed on piping sections that could be isolated. Local level indicators are present at the tank farm. Separate level indicators are monitored at the DCS.  The DCS also includes alarms for high and high-high conditions.  Procedures require that plant staff monitor transfers between delivery trucks and the storage tanks.  Procedures are in place for all load out operations to tanker trucks.  Spill containment systems are installed at "

      "SummaryText": "the truck load out racks. The truck load out scully is equipped with level sensors that automatically shut off flow if a high level is indicated.\n\n\n\nFRVE has developed a Risk Management Plan Prevention Program per 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as change management and incident investigation are conducted on an as-needed basis. FRVE has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify potential risks associated with the use and storage of these chemicals and has implemented the recommended changes that resulted from the PHAs.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFRVE has not had an accident related to the covered processes which has caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years. We believe that this record is largely due to the training program each of our operators and maintenance staff is required to complete prior to working independently within the facility. This training includes written coursework, on the job training with experienced staff, and a final evaluation.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a serious release from the facility, FRVE has coordinated response activities with the\n\nUtica Fire Department and Winnebago County LEPC. Contract response services are also available from Advanced Waste Services of West Allis, Wisconsin.\n\n"
