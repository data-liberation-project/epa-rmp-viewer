THE PLANT WAS ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED IN 1938 AND PLACED INTO SERVICE IN 1940. SECONDARY TREATMENT FACILITIES WERE ADDED IN 1967 TO REMOVE 90-95% OF SUSPENDED SOLIDS AND BIOLOGICAL OXYGEN DEMAND. EXISTING PLANT TREATMENT CAPACITY PROVIDES FOR A MAXIMUM DAILY FLOW OF UP TO 68 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY WITH A PEAK HOURLY TREATMENT CAPACITY OF 85 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY. CHLORINE IS USED AS A DISINFECTING AGENT AND IS ADDED TO THE PLANTS EFFLUENT AND ALLOWED TO MIX IN A SERIES OF MIXING CHAMBERS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE. AFTER SUFFICIENT MIXING HAS OCCURRED, SULFUR DIOXIDE IS ADDED TO NEUTRALIZE ANY EXCESS CHLORINE. BOTH SUBSTANCES, CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE, EXCEED APPLICABLE THRESHOLD QUANTITIES AND ARE BEING INCLUDED IN THIS RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. BOTH SUBSTANCES ARE USED AND STORED IN 1-TON CYLINDERS IN AN ENCLOSED ROOM. CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE MONITORS ARE INSTALLED IN EACH ENCLOSED ROOM WHERE THESE CYLINDERS ARE USED AND STORED. BOTH SUBSTANCES ARE AUTOMATICALLY METERED INTO THE SYSTEM THROUGH AUTOMATED PROCESS EQUIPMENT."
