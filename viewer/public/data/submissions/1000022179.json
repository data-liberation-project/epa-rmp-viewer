Pharmasol is located in an industrial park and is bounded on the north, east, and south by man-made ponds and on the west by other commercial or industrial properties.  There are no adjacent or nearby residential areas or environmental receptors.  There are no adjacent or nearby public receptors, other than commercial buildings to the west in the industrial park.\n\nPharmasol is committed to complete compliance with all federal, state and local environmental, health and safety statutes and regulations.  The company's objective is to provide a facility and working environment that is as safe, clean and pollution-free as possible for its workers and neighbors.\n\nPharmasol uses raw materials that pose a major hazard (flammability).  These include gas propellants used to manufacture aerosol products and denatured alcohols used in both aerosol and non-aerosol products.  The propellants; propane, butane, isobutane, and difluoroethane, are regulated substances that may at times be present above the threshold quantities listed under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nPharmasol has implemented programs to assure compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program standards.  The initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), completed in the fall of 2004, were the basis for preventative maintenance procedures; standard operating procedures to reduce and respond to flammability and explosion hazards; procedures for safe alcohol and propellant deliveries, contractor safety, hot work permits, gas house safety and lockout/tagout; employee safety and hazmat training; and emergency preparation and response. \n\nPharmasol reviewed, updated and revalidated the PHA/HAZOP in June 2011, using a team from the same management positions that h"

In the past five years there have been no major process changes and there have been no other process changes that would pose new or increased risks of any significance.  There are no new chemical or other hazards at the facility that would fall under PSM/RMP requirements.  Also, as part of revalidation Pharmasol replicated its offsite consequence analyses using RMP*Comp for the above propellants and found no changes from earlier results.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been had no accidental releases of hazardous materials at Pharmasol.  The company's core preventative maintenance program; materials handling and delivery procedures; and safety training have apparently helped curtail releases and will hopefully continue to do so in the future.\n\n"
