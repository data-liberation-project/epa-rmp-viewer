The terminal functions as a mixing, storage and distribution facility for the fertilizer used by Farmland's 600,000 producer-members to grow the crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 2,250 tons of ammonia, used primarily in mixing, and 56,000 tons of liquid fertilizer is distributed through this Agriliance facility that has been supplying co-ops in western Nebraska for 25 years.  The Grant facility provides a vital link in the chain of Farmland inputs.  Anhydrous ammonia, produced at Farmland's nitrogen manufacturing facilities, is shipped to the Grant facility where it is used to make starter fertilizers for local co-ops.  By eliminating much of the shipping costs for the co-ops, the terminal helps contain the cost of fertilizer for Farmland member-owners as well as provide a convenient location for them to get their product.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nAgriliance is a solid, reliable member of the Grant community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service member-owners as needed throughout the year.  Agriliance Grant employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to \"always be there if someone needs us.\"\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nAgriliance has five full-time  employees with more than 25 years of combined operating experience at its Grant facility.  Although few in number, these employees have a large impact on the community in which they live.  They have conducted facility tours for the local schools as well as the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nAgriliance employees recognize community involvement and volunteerism as the most effective way to improve the communities they live in.\n\n\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nAgril"

By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the environment.\n\nRisk Management Program\n\nThis facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Risk Management Program Rule require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a  Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The Program requirements include submission of the risk management plan, hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history,  development of a process accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Program for Farmland Industries, Inc.;  Grant Fertilizer Terminal at Grant, Nebraska.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nInitial construction and operation of the Grant Fertilizer Terminal began in 1974.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia received and stored at this facility is used in the formulation of liquid fertilizers.\n\nThe Grant Fertilizer Terminal is a distribution facility for liquid fertilizers consisting of (2) 30,000,and  (1) 12,000 gal pressurized ammo"

The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this terminal, the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, Agriliance is committed to the following:\n\n* A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n* A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n* Implementation of a Comprehensive Process Safety Management and Prevention Program\n* Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n* Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n* Planning, preparation and training for emergency response\n\nThe Grant terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan, as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, in effect for many years, and is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Response committee and emergency response agencies.

This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPA's RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.

A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nAgriliance's hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from an 80 ton rail car unloading at the facility.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank car, in 10 minutes.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternate Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical worst-case, tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario consider"

The hose is assumed to fail and release ammonia for a few seconds before automatic shutoff valves on the rail car and tank activate and stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program. A formal process hazard analysis revalidation is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
