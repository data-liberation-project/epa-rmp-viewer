We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe condition like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\n\r\nSenior management has appointed a PSM Coordinator to monitor and maintain overall compliance with the OSHA PSM Program.  The Refrigeration Manager oversees and maintains the EPA RMP program.  These two individuals work in close cooperation to maintain an effective program to reduce hazards and promote safe operations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at Cargill Turkey Products Springdale Facility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: Employee Participation Program, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis,"

The program is periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nIn the previous five years, this facility has had one accidental release of ammonia which resulted in plant evacuation and property damage. On February 6th 2012 a 13,655 lb release of anhydrous ammonia, during a 6-1/2 hour period, resulted in the evacuation of the plant. We improved our line break permitting process to a more stringent procedure as a result of this incident.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Springdale Fire Department.  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  The facility has an inhouse hazmat team which trains regularly and maintains compliance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 1910.120.    \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis was performed in 2013 where we identified 9 potential changes to increase safety.
