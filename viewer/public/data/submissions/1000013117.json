This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nSIRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls including level checks, level alarms, pressure reliefs, breakaway couplers, tank inspections and secondary containment to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nSIRE ethanol plant is located on 189th Street, south of Council Bluffs, Pottawattamie County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from grain. Regulated substances stored at the facility include anhydrous ammonia, which is used for pH control and as a nutrient in the fermentation process, and natural gasoline, which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case toxic scenario at the facility is the release of all 92,520 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud. The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site. The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 2.6 miles from the center of the plant. Industrial and commercial receptors are located within this 2.6 mile radius.\n\nThe worst-case flammable scenario at the facility is the release of 1,206,960 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion. The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank. The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the facility. There are public receptors within the 0.7 mile radius.\n"

A Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control plan and Facility Response Plan are implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards as is a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities. SIRE's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nSafety inspections are completed at the facility on a quarterly basis. \n\n"
