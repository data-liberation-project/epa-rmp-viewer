      "SummaryText": "This facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from the field well. The well stream is routed to a separator and the gas leg is sent to a compressor followed by a cryogenic process to remove NGL prior to the gas being dried in a glycol dehydration system.  The produced NGL is in a single 15,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 180 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the separator are routed to lower pressure separation equipment and the oil product is stored in two bulk atmospheric storage tanks (210 barrels each) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  Butane levels are approximately 78,000 lbs while pentane levels are estimated at 97,000 lbs.  The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest NGL vessel which is 15,000 gallons.  Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank which is 210 barrels (8,820 gallons).  Scenario #1 yields a distance to the endpoint of 0.3 miles while Scenario # 2 yields a distance of 0.1 miles.  Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.  An alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  The worst case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel thus no administrative controls or mitigation measures are used to limit the vol"

Emergency response procedures are contained in the front of the RMP manual kept at the facility.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
