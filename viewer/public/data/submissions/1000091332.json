Based on these findings, design criteria for the facility were established.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted using EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (March 2009).  Under the worst-case scenario, the overpressure endpoint from an explosion at Point Thomson could be felt 0.3 miles (1,584 feet) from its origin before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  The impact distance from a worst-case explosion extends beyond the facility property boundary.\n\nPoint Thomson has established the following practices and design measures to prevent potential accidents with offsite impacts.\n- The facility utilizes an extensive alarm system to monitor the plant operations and a central control room with an operator present at all times.\n- Access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel because of its remote location and through active 24-hour per day security and access control requirements.\n- The Point Thomson Production Facility has site-specific safety and emergency response training and job-specific safety training.  Emergency drills are conducted on a regular basis to test personnel knowledge of proper procedures.  \n- Hilcorp has an Integrity Management System and maintenance programs which prescribe inspection procedure frequencies for process equipment.\n- There is a Medical Emergency Response Team (MRT)  led by the Clinic Practice Provider and comprised of  several First Aid and CPR/AED volunteer trained responders. The MERT Team roles and responsibilities include, but are not limited to, scene size-up and safety, patient stabilization, patient care, packaging/transportation of victims, infectious disease assistance, and equipment maintenance and inspection.\n- There is an oil and hazardous materials Spill Response Team (SRT) led by the Alaska Clean Seas (ACS) spill Response Lead Technician and contractor personnel at site who are trained and qualified spill re"

      "SummaryText": "three separators, a knockout flare, an export pipeline, and numerous lines of connecting pipes.  The composition of the flammable substances vary in the hydrocarbon stream as the stream is processed in the gas cycling plant to separate the hydrocarbon condensate (for pipeline distribution to the Badami Sales Oil Pipeline) and the remaining gas is re-injected into the field reservoir or used on site as fuel gas.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Point Thomson Production Facility is a release that occurs during the processing of the hydrocarbon stream in the piece of equipment containing the largest quantity of flammable substances.  The worst-case release assumes all flammable gases are released and form a vapor cloud.  For this worst-case scenario, the entire content of the vapor cloud is assumed to be within the flammability limits and the cloud is assumed to explode.  For the worst-case analysis, EPA guidance documents conservatively assume that 10 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud participates in the explosion.  The distance to an overpressure level of one pound per square inch (psi) is defined in EPA guidance as the distance at which the impact is dangerous to the public.  For example, an overpressure of one psi may cause partial demolition of facilities, which can result in the shattering of glass windows, which may cause skin lacerations from flying glass or other serious injuries to people.\n\nA blast analysis has been included as part of the design basis for the facility.  A fire and explosion hazard analysis was conducted in the Front End Engineering Design phase to identify the siting requirements for the occupied buildings at the Point Thomson Production Facility.  The analysis evaluated the new equipment/facilities for potential flammable gas and liquid releases and the resultant fire and explosion hazards.  Plot of overpressure and impulse contours on the facility plot plan were developed to identify the potential impact of each explosio"

      "SummaryText": "Hilcorp North Slope, LLC (Hilcorp) operates the Point Thomson Production Facility on the Alaska North Slope.  The Point Thomson Production Facility is a gas cycling operation that processes approximately 200 million standard cubic feet-per-day of gas to recover approximately 10,000 barrels-per-day of hydrocarbon condensate.  The recovered hydrocarbon condensate product is sent to market via pipeline.  Most of the gas is re-injected into the field reservoir, but a small portion of the gas is used as fuel in the facility's combustion turbines to provide electrical power.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared based on Title 40, Part 68, Subpart G of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and other published U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.  The equipment at Point Thomson process hydrocarbons.  The hydrocarbon streams throughout the plant range in composition but contain various levels of flammable gases along with heavier hydrocarbons.  It was determined that the Point Thomson Production Facility has methane present in a quantity 5 times greater than the Chemical Accident Prevention Program threshold level of 10,000 pounds.  Methane is a regulated flammable gas.  Other flammable substances are present in the process fluids, but none of these other substances are present onsite at any one time in a quantity greater than the applicable threshold quantity.  It is estimated that the combined total of all flammable substances (methane, ethane, propane, etc.) within all the various equipment and piping is approximately 150,000 pounds.  The Point Thomson Production Facility was determined to be subject to RMP Program Level 1 requirements.  Program 1 imposes specific hazard assessment requirements and prevention and emergency response requirements.\n\nThe Point Thomson Production Facility is composed of many pieces of process equipment that contain flammable substances.  The process equipment includes a flash gas compressor, an injection compressor,"
