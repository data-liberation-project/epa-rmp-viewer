In addition to handling the release, the refinery has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.  In conjunction with our local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the refinery has ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\nThe Placid Refinery Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Refinery Manager. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM), emergency response, and accident prevention programs has been delegated to the Manager of Safety. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Environmental Manager.  In keeping with Placid's policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\nDescription and Regulated Substances\n\nPlacid is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Port Allen, Louisiana. Placid uses crude petroleum as their feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane. Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in some process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, Placid has 6 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\nP"

      "SummaryText": "lacid also handles one toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in a sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n7 Hydrofluoric acid is used as a catalyst in the HF Alkylation unit which produces alkylate.\n\nThe HF Alkylation Unit is covered because the unit contains more than the threshold quantity for hydrofluoric acid of 1,000 pounds.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nPlacid performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Placid does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like Placid. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. Placid has shared that information with the LEPC, local hospitals, and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses. If you are interested in this information, please contact Placid's receptionist at (225)  387-0278 and request the Environmental Manager.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\n7 When considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast.  Windows could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.  People could be seriously injured by being knocked down by the force of the blast, by flying glass, or by falling objects.\n\n7 When considering the release of a toxic substance,"

Also, Placid did not identify any worst-case scenarios that would affect public receptors other than the receptors affected by the scenarios reported above.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative case scenario for hydrogen fluoride (HF) is release from a > inch nozzle failure on the HF Alykalation Unit Acid Settler, resulting in a release of 875 gallons (approximately 7,250 lbs.) of HF gas over a 5-minute period.  The 5-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to isolate the acid settler, activate the water mitigation system, and thus effectively stopping the release.  The release of HF would be accompanied by hydrocarbons; therefore, the unit's existing hydrocarbon detectors were considered in estimating the discovery time of the release.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this scenario is 2.8 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances at the refinery is a release from an Isobutane Tank (Tank 114) resulting from overfilling and overpressuring the tank (7675 lbs released over a 5-minute period).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 5 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.11 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Placid.

Keeping employees informed and involved creates a team unity atmosphere.  Employees have participated on Process Hazards Analysis Teams and have access to all Hazop information and recommendations.  This information along with updated Operation Manuals are kept in the Control Room, Safety Department and Process Engineering.  Operation manuals are developed, updated and reviewed by Operations Personnel and the Training Department.  These Operation Manuals assist employees in refresher training and Operator Recertification Programs.\n\nSafety meetings are held on a regular basis for Operations, Maintenance, Laboratory, Terminal, Administration and Contract personnel.

Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is completed within six months if feasible.  Any item that cannot be taken care of within six months is documented and justified.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Safety Department.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Placid periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Placid has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Placid operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

It is Placid's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, Placid has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Placid and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter.59).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Placid.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Placid.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPlacid has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, of Placid employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery.

Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nAt distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with the toxic substance in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a failure from the acid settler/acid storage in the HF Alkylation Unit, resulting in a release of 1,500 gallons (approximately 12,500 lbs) of hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas over a 10-minute period.  Although Placid has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20-ppm (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this worst-case release scenario is approximately 11 miles. \n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is assumed to result in a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of the substance that could be released from Tank 11, which stores naphtha.  The entire quantity in the cloud is assumed to be between the upper and lower flammability limits of the substance.  For the worst-case consequence analysis, the vapor cloud is assumed to detonate.  The endpoint of the consequence analysis of a vapor cloud explosion of a regulated flammable substance is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).
