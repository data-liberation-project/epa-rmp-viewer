      "SummaryText": "Maumee Complex RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Maumee Wholesale Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular) and miscellaneous farm supplies.  The Liquid Poly Phosphate Processing facility began operations in the fall of 1994.  Key personnel at the Maumee facility are Ted Fillmore - facility manager and Joe Schweitzer - operations manager.\n\nThe facility manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 18,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe Liquid Plant occupies approximately 2.5 acres and is situated on the west side of The Andersons Complex and northeast of the intersection of Ford Street and Illinois Ave.  There are two businesses directly to the north, Williams Brothers Concrete and Stoneco.  Charlie?s Dodge Dealership is located to the west, on the other side of Ford St.  The Andersons General Store is southeast of the plant, across Illlinois Ave.  \n\nThe only RMP-regulated material stored at the Maumee Complex is anhydrous ammonia at the Wholesale Fertilizer facility.  A 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  An"

      "SummaryText": "hydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia and propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (a tanker truck or rail car) to the bulk storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced by the transporter or The Andersons in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers of anhydrous from the bulk storage tank to the processing system occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These ?events? are very short in duration ? a few seconds at the most.  \n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank for anhydrous ammonia was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code. The National Board Certificates for the tank is on file.   The storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks or appendages are performed by certified welders and stamped accordingly.  The worst case scenario depicts a catastrophic loss of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, while hooked up to a railcar full of product.  Neither ves"

      "SummaryText": "sel would be entirely full when connected.  The storage tank gets refilled when it reaches approximately 30% full.  A railcar holds 150,000 pounds of NH3 and at 30% capacity, the storage tank holds approximately 44,545 pounds of NH3 -- for a combined total of 194,545 pounds of NH3.  This is the amount that could be released if there was a catastrophic failure of both vessels while connected.\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Maumee facility are:\n?  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n?  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection points to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank(s), the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n \nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Maumee facility are:\n?  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on both storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won?t reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n?  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane"

      "SummaryText": " from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tank.\n?  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n?  An emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the anhydrous ammonia bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves (?snappy joes?) on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n?  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a water hydrant to help knock down a vapor cloud.\n?  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n?  Operator and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility?s hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\nThis facility uses a certified contractor for all welding and construction performed on the anhydrous ammonia tank or transfer pipes.  Copies of all reports are on file. The Maumee processing plant undergoes a complete ammonia inspection by a third party at least every five years.\n\nSee ?Steps Taken to Address Hazards? for more information on prevention measures and identification.\n\nManagement System\n(see ?Steps Taken to Address Hazards?)\n\nEquipment maintenance\nAll equipment mainte"

During this review, they are informed of any potential hazards at the facility, emergency procedures, site-specific safety rules and the ability to request an MSDS for any product at any time.\n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards\nThe Andersons Maumee Wholesale Fertilizer facility has many systems in place for hazard assessment and mitigation.  \n\nThe Safety Department performs annual hazard management audits at the facility.  The audits include a physical walk through of the entire facility and a review of all EPA, OSHA and DOT paperwork and training documentation.  Action items are noted and recommendations are made. The audits consist of five major topical areas:  Safety & Health, Environmental, Fire Protection & Security, Administrative and Housekeeping & Storage.  Issues are documented in a report and sent to the facility manager and upper management.  Updates on action item status must be made regularly.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been made at the Maumee facility, as part of their Process Safety Management Program.  The analysis will be updated every five years, or as changes in the process are made.  PHA?s are performed using the ?what-if? technique and analyze all aspects involved in the production of 10-34-0 fertilizer.  The evaluation team includes representatives from the corporate Safety Department, group Management and Operations employees.\n\nEach ?what-if? situation is discussed and possible causes are listed.

Finally, results are evaluated and prioritized.\n\nFormal investigations are performed for all environmental or safety incidents.  Documentation is kept on file at the facility and the corporate Safety Department.\n\nA formal Management of Change (MOC) system is administered by the Safety Department.  A form is filled out whenever a change is made to the 10-34-0 production system.  Forms are routed from the facility operator to the Engineering and Safety Departments for review and remarks.  A copy of the completed is form is sent back to the operator.\n\nMonthly Safety Committee meetings allow employees to discuss any concerns they may have with the operation of the facility.  Issues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\n\nThe Maumee facility also participates in a ?best practices? task force meeting at least annually to discuss production and quality issues, as well as training and methods for continuous improvement of the process.  Operators and management, together with representatives from the Safety and Engineering Departments spend the day discussing any and all issues related to the production of 10-34-0 and aqua ammonia.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\nIn the event of a burst hose or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the conversion process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off. \n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate.
