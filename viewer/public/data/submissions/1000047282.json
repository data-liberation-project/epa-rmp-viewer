The popularity of chlorine as a water disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and ability to provide a low but measurable residual in the water supply.\r\n\r\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community, and the environment.  Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from much higher chlorine exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\r\n\r\nOrange County's commitment at the Western Regional WSF is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is Orange County's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine accidental release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe primary measures for accidental chlorine release prevention are contained in the document Proces"

This process safety management (PSM) document was prepared in conformance with the OSHA and EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention. Western Regional WSF's Section Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented in the workplace as written.\r\n\r\nThe Western Regional WSF emergency response plan relies on a team of offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services.  The emergency response plans at Western Regional WSF are based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the Western Regional WSF and regional response plans. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nChlorine is received at the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all chlorine cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the cylinders are stored inside an enclosed building equipped with a chlorine detector that immediately notifies the operators of a release should a leak occur.  Two banks of six cylinders each are connected to the disinfection process:  one is in-use, and one is as standby.  The standby cylinders will automatically switchover when the in-use cylinders become empty, ensuring continuous disinfection.     \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOCU's PSM document contains 13 essential release prevention elements.  Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:  \r\n\r\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the chlorine process, to identify potential"

The process hazard analysis is updated every 5 years.\r\n\r\n* Operating procedures review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the chlorine process.\r\n\r\n* Training programs: Training is given to each employee assigned to the process with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling and emergency response. Training includes hazard awareness training on how to recognize a leak and initiate the Incident Command system.\r\n\r\n* Contractors:   OCU ensures through its contract provisions that contractors supplying or working with chlorine are held to a standard of safety performance that complies with OCU's safety goals and objectives, and also meets relevant agency requirements.  For example, OCU personnel make visits to the supplier's site to ensure that rules and guidelines concerning chlorine and cylinder integrity are being followed.\r\n\r\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of the process is maintained by implementing preventive maintenance and routine inspection and testing procedures.\r\n\r\n* Management of Change: The management of change procedures provide a systematic approach to evaluate and control the safety and health aspects of any significant change to the process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures.\r\n\r\n* Incident Investigation: OCU investigates within 48 hours any accidents or near misses that could have resulted in a chlorine release, in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\r\n\r\nThe above elements are only part of OCU's aggressive safety program.  In addition to the 13 PSM elements, OCU has established related OSHA safety programs such as hot work and confined space.  These OSHA safety programs apply to both OCU and contractor employees. \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlor"

If a major chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\r\n\r\nIn addition to the PSM/RMP measures described above, OCU has bolstered its security measures following a vulnerability analysis conducted in compliance with the new federal rules for Homeland Security.  These measures will ensure greater safety against accidental releases as well as improved safety for onsite workers."
