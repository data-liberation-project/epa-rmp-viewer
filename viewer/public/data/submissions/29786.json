The facility is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner using a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  \n\nCovered Chemicals\n\nThe facility is regulated under RMP due to the presence of chlorine, which is present in an amount greater than the threshold quantity as defined by the RMP rule. \n\nChlorine is stored on-site in 1-ton (2000 lb) cylinders, and is used to disinfect process water.  \n\nHazard Assessments\n\nWorst case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted. In the chlorine Worst Case Scenario, a sudden rupture and release of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder would reach the prescribed toxic endpoint  of 3 ppm at a distance of 1.3 miles from the chlorine release area.  Reference tables from the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants were used for these calculations.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is based on a leak from a cylinder valve, regulator or other cylinder fittings.  The toxic endpoint distance for this scenario is 0.2 miles, which only affects areas within the Celriver site.   Reference tables from the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants were also used for these calculations.  \n \nPrevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented a Program Level 3 Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules, and in accordance with US EPA and OSHA requirements.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from the facility and include  the following elements: employee participation, process safety information,   process hazard analyses, operating and maintenance procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, prestartup safety reviews, co"

The facility has not had any RMP reportable accidents of  chlorine within the five years preceding this RMP submittal.    \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n The facility has an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The facility  has an on-site emergency brigade and other emergency systems to respond to emergencies.  The facility has  coordinated its emergency response plans with the local fire departments and the York County Emergency Management Agency and LEPC to ensure appropriate response.\n\nSummary\n\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with the RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintain the safety of the RMP covered process through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain and improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance, incident investigations, and updates of process safety systems will be conducted"
