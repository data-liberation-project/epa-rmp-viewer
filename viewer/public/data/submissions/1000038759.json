      "SummaryText": "WinCo is a diversified retailer of grocery products throughout the United States. WinCo operates many retail grocery stores throughout the western states that are supplied through WinCo's distribution center located in Phoenix, AZ. WinCo's Phoenix Distribution Center employs approximately 200 and utilizes anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of perishable grocery products in storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA Regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n\r\nPursuant to RMP Regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations WinCo has developed a comprehensive RMP/PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals (anhydrous ammonia) located on site. The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using the Refrigeration Contractor that was building the system, the General Contractor, the contractor retained by WinCo to operate and maintain the refrigeration system, Facility Maintenance Managers from WinCo's other ammonia refrigerated Distribution Centers, WinCo's Director of Environmental Compliance and was facilitated by an experienced 3rd party  refrigeration engineer from Apex Refrigeration. \r\n\r\nWinCo's implementation of the RMP/PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The Plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding"
