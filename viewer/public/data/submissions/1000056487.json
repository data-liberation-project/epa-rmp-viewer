Catalytic makes every effort to be in compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Therefore, Catalytic has prepared this RMP for its Ammoniating Process in accordance to 40 CFR 68 Subpart G, as the Ammoniating Process contains a stationary source holding a toxic substance in excess of the threshold quantity.  The toxic substance held in Catalytic's Ammoniating Process is ammonia (anhydrous), which has a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs according to Table 1 of 40 CFR 68.130.  \n\n\n\n1.1     40 CFR 68.155(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent an accidental release of ammonia Catalytic has implemented top engineering practices for the transfer of ammonia into the storage vessel and transfer from the storage vessels to the solutions to be ammoniated.  In the case of an accidental release Catalytic has in place a tiered emergency response dependent on the severity of the release.  Severity is to be assessed by Catalytic's employees and proper response is to be followed.  This tiered response includes protocols for contacting local emergency personnel.\n\n \n\n1.2     40 CFR 68.155(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThe stationary source in Catalytic's Ammoniating Process is two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The total storage capacity of the combined tanks is 14,000 gallons (72,100 lbs at 60 oF) Tank 1 has a maximum storage capacity of  2,000 gallons (10,300 lbs at 60 oF) while Tank 2 has a maximum storage capacity of 12,000 gallons (61,800 lbs at 60 oF).  Administrative controls are in place such that each tank is to be filled to a capacity no greater than 85%.  This reduces the storage capacity to 1,700 gallons (8,755 lbs) and 10,200 gallons (52530 lbs) for Tank 1 and 2 respectively.  Thus the total storage capacity, taking into"

Further prevention involves regulating access to the ammonia storage tanks.  Training in all pertinent operating procedures is given to all employees and contract workers before they are involved in the process.  Security measures are in place such that all tanks are locked when unattended and monitored via security cameras.  In the case of suspicious activity the Rolla Police Department is notified and the site is secured by the police.\n\n\n\n1.4    40 CFR 68.155(d) The five-year accident history\n\nCatalytic Innovations has had no previous accidents involving its Ammoniating Process.\n\n\n\n1.5    40 CFR 68.155(e) The emergency response program\n\n\n\nCatalytic Innovations has an emergency response program in place.  It involves the determination of severity and protocols for resolution.  If the release is less than 300 ppm the release will be mitigated by trained employees of Catalytic following the procedures outlined in the emergency response program.  If the release is in excess of 300 ppm this is considered a \"significant release\" and Rolla City Fire/Police Dispatch will be notified.\n\n\n\n1.6    40 CFR 68.155(f) Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAs Catalytic Innovations has had no previous accidents involving its Ammoniating Process, Catalytic intends to maintain the safety measures in place and has no planned changes to improve the process safety.\n\n"
