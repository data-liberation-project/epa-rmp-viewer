The amount of acetylene in an entire trailer is less than 6,800 pounds.   Several trailers could be present at the location at any time. \r\n\r\nC.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\nWe used the computer program RMP comp as guidance for both scenarios.  Both scenarios included acetylene as this is the only product that falls under the guidelines.  For both scenarios, the endpoint is within 0.2 mile from the plant.  The public receptors within the 0.2 mile radius of the plant are a lime storage and sales facility and a residential house.  Both are located on Western International property.\r\n\r\nD. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nWestern complies with the OSHA PSM regulations and NFPA 51A guidelines. \r\n\r\nWestern takes pride in having done it right the first time before an accident or incident would require any form of additional safety measures.  This facility has multiple gas monitors throughout the production areas and fire detectors.  The monitors are set to alarm at 10 % of the lower explosive limit (LEL).  If any two alarms reach 20% of the LEL at the same time, it will completely shut down the entire plant.  Our system will also not allow an override of this safety feature requiring the problem to be fixed immediately or the system will not start back up.  \r\n\r\n\r\nE.  The five year accident history;\r\nOn April 10, 2001 a fire occurred at Western International Gas in Bellville, Tx.   During the incident approximately 13,700 lbs of acetylene gas was released and subsequently burned.  No injuries beyond first aid occurred as a result of this incident.  There were no off site consequences in either physical damage or environmentally.   As a direct result of the incident investigation, procedures were changed, equipment and piping were altered, additional fire"

The emergency response program:\r\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Bellville Fire Department and Local EMS system.  Western's Safety and Compliance Director is actively involved in the local LEPC.  Western invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them with our facility and products.  These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified. \r\n\r\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur.  Monthly safety meetings are held for all employees.  Alert systems within the facility consist of an evacuation horn, audible paging system, handheld radios, and by handheld cellular phones. \r\n\r\nG.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nIt is the intentions of management and this company to continue to train and strive for excellence in the industrial gas business.  We believe that properly trained personnel are safe personnel and therefore have no intentions of reducing the importance of safety.  Safety First will remain the policy for this company."
