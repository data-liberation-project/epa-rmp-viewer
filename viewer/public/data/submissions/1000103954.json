New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently and have passed a written proficiency test.\nRefresher training is provided annually.\n\nMaintenance:\nThe Chesapeake Terminal carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functioning. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Equipment manufacturer's written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nThe Chesapeake Terminal conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nChesapeake Terminal personnel promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of LPG. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Chesapeake, VA Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

Hazard Reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of conducting activities safely within our butane distribution facility, personnel at the Chesapeake Terminal maintain written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation, such as emergency shutdown system/ startup procedures, pre-operational visual inspection procedures, rail car un-loading procedures, rail car loading procedures, ship loading procedures, and transport loading and unloading procedures. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.
