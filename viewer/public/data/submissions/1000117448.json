The residual treated Chunchula gas is then routed to the plant\u0092s fuel system to be utilized as plant fuel.  \nThe condensate stabilizer receives hydrocarbon liquids from a number of sources, mainly from the plant inlet separation, debutanizer bottoms (as described above) and from the \u0093Y-Grade\u0094 system that is further described below.  There are other small sources including various heavy hydrocarbon dumps in the plant.   The condensate stabilizer treats the liquid to form a stable crude oil product that can be stored in low pressure storage tanks.  This is achieved through a trayed column with the application of heat in a reboiler provided by the plant\u0092s hot oil system.  Lighter components are removed and combined with the separated inlet gas for processing.  The stabilized bottoms product is cooled and routed to two, low-pressure condensate storage tanks.  Liquids from the storage tanks are shipped offsite to sales via truck.  The condensate tanks are equipped with gas blanketing and vapors are captured and compressed via a vapor recovery unit and routed to the plant\u0092s fuel system.  \nThe facility receives \u0093Y-Grade\u0094 product from various producers that deliver product to the facility via truck.  The y-grade is a mixture of natural gas liquids containing ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes and heavier components.  The product is offloaded from tanker trucks via a truck unloading station. Third party trucks will offload y-grade utilizing their hoses and onboard pumps.  The product is stored in the Y-grade storage tank and then routed to the condensate stabilizer to be treated as described above.  \nThe facility\u0092s process contains threshold quantities of regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane.   \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nOne flammable w"

The worst-case scenario involves a catastrophic failure of a single condensate storage tank.  The alternative flammable release scenario is a loading line rupture on the propane truck loading rack.  These are described in more detail below:\nFlammable Worst-Case Scenario \u0096 \nThis involves a hypothetical catastrophic failure of a single condensate storage tank.  The two condensate storage tanks are the facility\u0092s largest hydrocarbon storage vessels.  These tanks contain greater than threshold quantities of regulated flammable mixtures containing Methane, Ethane, Propane, i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, and n-Pentane.  The majority of the fluid in the tanks is unregulated hexanes+.  However, all the contents of the tank are allocated on a mass weighted average basis back to the regulated flammable substances for the worst-case scenario evaluation.  This estimation is conservative and is required under \u00a7 68.115(b)(2).  This scenario assumes the tank is 100% full and assumes failure of applicable safeguards.  The worst-case flammable release distance to endpoint was determined using EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp.  The distance to the 1psi overpressure endpoint is 1.1 miles.  There are a number of public receptors within this distance including 67 Residences with an estimated residential population of 201.\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario \u0096 \nThe alternative flammable release scenario is a rupture or separation of the truck loading line on the propane truck loading rack resulting in an uncontrolled flow of propane through a 3\u0094 diameter flow area.  The facility utilized the release rate estimate technique outlined in EPA\u0092s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, Chapter 9 to estimate the release rate for this scenario.  This scenario resulted in a release rate of 14,434lb/min and a release lasting 16 minutes. The estimated distance to the 1psi overpressure endpoint of"

It is situated on a 30-acre plot west of Creola, Alabama in Mobile County, 1340 Radcliff Road in Section 10, Township 2S, Range 1W.  \nThe plant is fed by a number of natural gas wells that deliver gas to the plant inlet.  The gas goes through separation, amine treating, dehydration, NGL extraction, and compression for eventual delivery to a sales gas pipeline.  Extracted natural gas liquids are further processed through fractionation to produce marketable propane and butane that are sold and transferred to transport trucks at the facility.  Natural gas condensate from plant inlet separation is stabilized and stored in condensate tanks and transferred to transport trucks for sales.   The facility also receives \u0093Y-Grade\u0094 product from various sources via transport trucks which is loaded into a Y-Grade storage tank and injected into the condensate stream where it is stabilized and stored along with the natural gas condensate.  A peripheral gas field also delivers natural gas to the facility, and this gas is treated, dehydrated, and processed through a JT skid to extract liquids.  The remaining peripheral gas is only used as fuel for the facility as the nitrogen content makes it non-marketable to the downstream pipeline.  The extracted natural gas liquids from this peripheral gas stream are sent to the main inlet separation where remaining liquids are stabilized and stored along with the main feed\u0092s natural gas condensate.   \nProcess heat for the facility is provided through the use of two, natural gas fired, hot oil heaters.  Hot oil is used for amine regeneration, fractionation, condensate stabilization, and glycol regeneration.  Refrigeration used for liquids extraction is accomplished through a propane refrigeration system.\nThe facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program due to the type and quantities of chemica"

Although small amounts of hydrogen sulfide are present in the in the gas streams feeding the plant, it exists in a small quantity that it is below threshold quantities per 40 CFR 68.130.  \nThe facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and is an EPA RMP Program 3 Facility.   \nPROCESS DESCRIPTION \u0096 GAS PROCESSING\nThe Hatters Pond plant takes raw natural gas from the Hilcorp operated Hatters Pond and Chunchula fields where the gas undergoes a series of processes to deliver marketable natural gas, natural gas condensate, propane, and butane to market.  Threshold quantities of regulated flammable substances are present at the facility, but no threshold quantities of regulated toxic substances are present at the facility.  \nThe Hatters Pond field gas enters the plant at approximately 50psig, then undergoes separation and is compressed to approximately 185 psig.  The gas flows through a DGA (Diglycolaamine) amine unit that removes CO2 and H2S from the gas stream.  Rich amine from the DGA contactor is flashed in a flash vessel and the flash gas is sent to the plant\u0092s fuel system to be used as fuel for various fired processes in the facility. The rich amine liquid flows to the DGA regeneration unit where the CO2 and H2S are driven off with heat from the facility\u0092s hot oil system, creating a lean DGA stream.   The CO2 and H2S acid gas is incinerated in a thermal oxidizer.  The lean DGA is cooled and sent back to the amine contactor to restart the cycle.  \nThe treated, wet gas stream from the DGA contactor is further compressed to approximately 900 psig and then dehydrated in a triethylene glycol contact tower to meet pipeline water content specification and to avoid freezing in the gas chiller.  The dry gas is then sent to a Gas Chiller where it is cooled to a design temperature of -20 deg. F for hydrocarbo"

The cold, dry gas leaves the chiller and enters the Cold Separator where liquid hydrocarbons (NGLs) and the dry gas are separated.  The treated, dry gas is then delivered to a downstream pipeline for gas lift and sales.  Process cooling in the chiller is achieved through a propane refrigeration system.  \nThe separated natural gas liquids are then routed to a fractionation train consisting of one deethanizer, one depropanizer, and one debutanizer.  These are a series of trayed columns for separation of the mixed NGL product into constituent products - Ethane, Propane, Butane, and Natural Gasoline.  The deethanizer overhead product is sent to the plant sales line.   The deethanizer bottoms are routed to the depropanizer.  The depropanizer bottoms are routed to the debutanizer.  The resultant propane and butane products are cooled and stored in pressurized storage tanks and shipped offsite to sales via truck.  The propane and butane tanks are pressurized with pressure control being routed to flare.  The debutanizer bottoms product is produced as natural gasoline and is routed to the condensate stabilizer as described below.  \nThe facility also receives a portion of its natural gas feed from the Chunchula field.  This gas is similarly treated in a DGA contactor that shares a common regeneration system as described above.  The treated gas is dehydrated via triethylene glycol and routed to a Joule-Thompson system (JT skid) where the gas undergoes a series of pressure drops and heat exchanges to extract natural gas liquids.  The JT skid is self-contained and requires no process heat or cooling (hot oil or refrigeration) and contains no rotating machinery (such as pumps, compressors, etc.).  These resultant liquids are sent back to the plant\u0092s inlet separation, where remaining liquids (after a pressure drop) are routed to the plant\u0092s condensate stabilizer and stored in the condensate storage tanks.
