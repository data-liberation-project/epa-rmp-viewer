Huntsman Sour Lake Olefins Facility (SLOF) is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  The Huntsman SLOF implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals, and conforms to the Texas Railroad Commission requirements.  Huntsman SLOF participates with the Hardin County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  The  Manager Strategic Planning & Pipelines is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP) at the SLOF.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances. The Sour Lake Olefins Facility (SLOF) is located in Sour Lake, Texas, just off of Stonewall Road.  The site stores olefins, namely, ethylene and propylene.  These products are stored in underground salt dome caverns and processed to remove water. \n\nThe two (2) flammable regulated substances are:\n\nEthylene ? Product used to manufacture polyethylene grocery bags, wraps and machine parts, and as a raw material for other ethylene based products (ethylene glycol-antifreeze, ethanol amines-shaving creams, hand lotions, furniture polishes, and dry-cleaning preparations, etc.)\n\nPropylene ? Product used to manufacture polypropylene materials such  films, clothesline and other kinds of rope and, in turn, is used as a raw material for other propylene based materials (propylene glycol-factory fill antifreeze and propylene oxide).\n \n4.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman?s SLOF has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlin"

This includes information pertaining to: \n\nHazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nHuntsman SLOF has performed process hazard analysis (PHA) on each process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The SLOF utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  Employees are assigned to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \nOperating Procedures\nOperating Contractor SLOF maintains written operating procedures that we"

The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \nTraining\nOperating Contractor SLOF provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \nMechanical Integrity\nOperating Contractor SLOF has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \nManagement of Change\nHuntsman/Operating Contractor SLOF has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any  modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.

The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \nCompliance Audit\nHuntsman SLOF performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management Program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \nIncident Investigation\nHuntsman and Operating Contractor SLOF investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman SLOF has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman SLOF has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to  document their resolution.

Huntsman SLOF ensures that all employees have access to PHA?s and all other process safety management information.\n \nHot Work Permit\nHuntsman/Operating Contractor SLOF employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman SLOF issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot work permits are kept on file until the work is complete.\n \nContractors\nHuntsman SLOF has developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  Huntsman SLOF provides information to contractors about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed appropriate safe work practices.  Huntsman SLOF also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\n\n4.  5 Year Accident History.
