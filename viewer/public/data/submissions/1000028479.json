This commitment is reinforced by compliance with the OSHA PSM requirements through a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.      \n\n\n\nSI Group Inc. is highly committed to decrease the likelihood that a release will occur, but unforeseeably if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel in coordination with the Cocke County Emergency Management Agency will contol and mitigate the effects of the release.  At SI Group Inc., control is implemented by applying \" six layers of protection.\"  \n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe first layer of protection is comprised of our employees who are highly trained to utilize the distributive control system to safely operate the process.  The second line of defense is implementation of our Mechanical Integrity Program which complies with the OSHA PSM rules and ensures integrity and preventative maintenance on the equipment.  Thirdly, Hazard Reviews through HAZOP Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted by examining all process procedures and equipment. The process controls and devices such as relief control valves and flares, make up the fourth layer of protection.  Backing up the controls is the monitoring system, which includes continual data readout by operators in the control room. A sixth layer of protection is provided by our Emergency Response team, which has at its disposal equipment sufficient to control a release. \n\nThe Cocke County Fire Department is familiar with our facilty and can provide prompt backup.     \n\n\n\n2.

This chemical is a byproduct of the chemical production process and is more commonly called isobutylene.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility is operated to comply with OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.119, which includes designs and mechanical integrity based on ASME standards. The operating procedures specifically address release prevention of the substance according to OSHA PSM. The site is also subject to control requirements under the EPA Title V Air Permit Program. The 2-Methylpropene storage and transfer facilities are designed according to NFPA 58 (Liquified Petroleum Gas Code). Pressure vessels are designed and tested according to State of Tennessee regulations on boilers and pressure vessels. \n\n\n\nA. Process Safety Information.\n\nSI Group Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating safety information, operating parameters, and equipment designs.\n\n\n\nB. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nSI Group Inc. has conducted and will revalidate as needed, comprehensive studies to ensure hazards are identified and controlled. The methodology used to carry out the analyses are HAZOP and what if checklists. In addition, based on the PHA findings, further evaluations are conducted using a Layer Of Protection Analysis (LOPA)to determine if additional controls are needed per a Safety Instrumented System (SIS) The methods are based on the IEC 61511 Functional safety -Safety instrumented systems for the process industry 2003-01. Any findings are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  Consequences of deviation and emergency procedures are included.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe SI Group Inc. emergency response personnel are organized in"

All employees are trained and participate in the Management of Change system.\n\n\n\nPre-startup \n\nBefore startup of the process or changes in the process, formal safety reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing the equipment in operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSI Group Inc. conducts audits to determine that the provisions under PSM and RMP are implemented. These audits will be repeated at least every three years. SI Group' application for the Tennessee OSHA (TOSHA) Volunteer Star (VPP) program has been accepted and based on the successful on-site TOSHA evaluation completed on May 9, 2013, TOSHA  will recommend to the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development that SI Group - Tennessee Operations be awarded Tennessee STAR VPP status.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees participated in the PHA and pre-startup safety reviews as well as contibuted to modifying the design and procedures for the safest operation.
