In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, enviromental, and plant safety.\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. is located at 720 Barre Road, Archbold, Ohio.  We manufacture and package frozen products.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is shipping and receiving docks.\n \nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nFrozen Specialties"

Facility in Archbold, Ohio is a Pizza Manufacturing Facility. The facility incorporates an Ammonia Refrigeration System which is a standard Compression and Evaporation Style System specifics are avaialbe through the office of the Safety Manager.\n\nRelease scenarios, both worst case and alternate release, have been developed and specifics are located within other areas of this RMP submittal.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. has had one major accident within the last ten years. This involved a fire in a storage area where ammonia was present. There were only minor injuries reported and no deaths. Modifications have been made to the system to prevent any reoccurance.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Engineer and Emergency Response Facilitator.  The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe engineer determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Frozen Specialties, Inc. Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nFrozen Specialties, Inc. is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility.
