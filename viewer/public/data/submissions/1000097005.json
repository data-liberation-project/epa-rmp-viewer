      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nValero Renewable Fuels Albert City Plant\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Valero Renewable Fuels, LLC dry mill ethanol production facility located in Albert City, Iowa (Valero Renewable Fuels).  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Valero ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, and natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities.  \r\n\r\n1.      Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nValero Renewable Fuels - Albert City is committed to the safety of employees and the community, and the protection of the environment.  The ethanol production facility is designed with safeguards to minimize potential for accidental releases of hazardous chemicals or flammable mixtures.  In addition to process design and equipment specifications, Valero trains employees on process hazard awareness and emergency response procedures to prevent or minimize accidental releases of flammable or toxic chemicals.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release occurs which has the potential to affect off-site locations, Valero will implement appropriate emergency response actions.  Depending on the circumstances, Valero will coordinate response actions with the local emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n2.      Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Valero Albert City, Iowa facility is designed to manufacture 110 million gallons per year of fuel ethanol.  The process begins by converting corn starch into basic sugars. Then the sugar reacts via yeast fermentation to become an ethanol rich, intermediate aqueous product.  The ethanol is separated by d"

      "SummaryText": ", fires, explosions, over-pressurizations, mechanical integrity failure, over-filling and other types of failure-analyses.  The facility process equipment is designed with process safety controls such as pressure relief equipment, back-flow control valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, process alarms, electrical grounding equipment, and excessive flow devices to prevent or limit releases.  \r\n\r\nValero maintains documentation, available to employees, contractors, and visitors, which include process safety information regarding potential chemical exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations.  Mostly process stream and chemical material information is summarized in documents called material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\r\n\r\nValero also maintains current documents on process design and equipment construction details.  This includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training\r\n\r\nValero maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations, including normal operations, manual operation, regeneration, and emergency shutdown. The facility provides comprehensive training for all employees involved in facility operations.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nValero has established contractor safety procedures and minimum guidelines for on-site activities to assure that contractors follow safe work practices and procedures.  Contractors are screened and trained on the facility process hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\t\r\nValero personnel conduct a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into servic"

      "SummaryText": "e.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nValero's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\t\r\nValero's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nValero promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  Investigations are conducted to document the root causes and circumstances that led to an incident occurring as well as assist in developing corrective actions to prevent similar future releases.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nValero will conduct audits of the provisions of the RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  The audit will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\r\n\r\n4.        Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has no history of accidents that involve RMP regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n5.      Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nValero maintains a written Emergency Response plan (ERP). The purpose of the ERP is to provide plans and response guidance to facility personnel to help protect on-site workers, the community, and the environment.  The ERP addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local"

These solids are also separated and then dried into what is called distiller grains that are sold as livestock feed.\r\n\r\nTwo EPA regulated substances exist at the Valero facility above the risk management threshold planning level: anhydrous ammonia and natural gasoline.\r\n1.) Anhydrous ammonia:\r\nThe ethanol production process requires anhydrous ammonia for pH control and as a nutrient in the fermentation process.  Tanker trucks deliver the ammonia to Valero.  The ammonia is stored as a liquid in a closed, pressurized vessel on-site.\r\n2.) Natural gasoline:\r\nValero blends natural gasoline or similar petroleum denaturants with the distilled ethanol to comply with federal regulations and to meet motor vehicle fuel quality specifications.  Tanker trucks deliver the natural gasoline to Valero where it is stored in an atmospheric tank with an internal floating roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.      Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nValero has prepared emergency response procedures that are specific to the hazards posed by chemicals stored on-site.  Trained personnel conduct reviews of facility equipment, operations, and maintenance activities to minimize potential for accidental releases.  The Valero preventative programs and training activities are described below:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nValero employees participate by gathering process safety information, by conducting process hazard analyses (PHA), by conducting incident investigations, by developing standard operating procedures, by preparing emergency response plans, and by communicating management of change.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nIn conducting a process hazard analysis (PHA), Valero personnel utilize the HAZOP methodology.  When conducting a PHA, hazards are identified by evaluating the potential for toxic releases"
