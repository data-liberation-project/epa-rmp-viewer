With the increase in  and operation, there occured a proportional increase in anhydrous ammonia inventory precipitating the requirements of Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning. Anhydrous Ammonia is the only chemical present at the facility in sufficient volume to require the Process Safety and Risk Management Planning.\n\nAs is indicated in the application, there have been no emergency releases of Ammonia from the facility in the last 5 years.  In actuality, there have been no emergency releases of Ammonia nor any other toxic/flammable chemicals since the facility was constructed in 1990. The ammonia system is inspected and notations of operations are recorded daily.  The refrigeration system also has built-in active monitoring with automatic paging when conditions fall outiside of normal parameters of temperature, pressure or volume levels.\n\nIn terms of Emergency Response preparedness, we have dedicated a team of some 30 staff members to courses on chemical emergency response (OSHA HAZWOPER, paragraph Q emphasis) with half yearly \"table top\" and \"hands on\" scenarios.  We have actively soliticited and received local fire department participation in training and \"hands on\" exercises.  "
