The Newark facility receives acetylene in bulk trailers.  The facility had the ability to produce acetylene through calcium carbide generation and then compresses it into cylinders for distribution by truck, but that operation is currently shut down and has been disconnected indefinitely.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of tile 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA;\n\n-Acetylene which is compressed into individual cylinders for sale to customers.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nWelco Acetylene Corp. is dedicated to being the best performing  industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs. Our Safety, health and environmental policies call for a commitment to protecting the health & safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment. This is a basis for engineering  and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental releases and operational safety programs that ensure the safe operation of our facility. Welco Acetylene Corp. is committed to continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPrevention program:\n\n    In accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Rule, our Newark, N.J. facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around safety concepts such as;\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances and the critical operating perameters of the associated systems and equipment.\n\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain and control key program e"
