The main activity carried out by the company is the distribution of chemical substances and related materials. These materials are stored in two main areas, a closed warehouse and open area on the backside of the facility. The business consist of buying and selling chemicals for industrial customers in the island. The facility receives the materials included in this RMP already in their end use package. For this reason, the major risk encountered is the possibility of a package rupture during the forklift handling.\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent the risk, Mays Ochoa has implemented a safety and security program in which training to personnel in forklift operation, hazardous materials handling and warehouse safety is included. Also, to address this issue we have prepared the following procedure:\n\nPREVENTION, PREPAREDNESS, CONTINGENCY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR THE WAREHOUSE FACILITIES\n\nThe information contained in this plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for a Prevention, Preparedness and Contingency Plan as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 265.50 through 265.56, as well as any applicable Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws, rules and regulations. Also, elements of Emergency Response Plans (in accordance to EPCRA requirements), and of Risk Management Plans (40 CFR 63) have been incorporated. The content of this plan have been expanded to cover not only hazardous wastes but also hazardous materials present at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis contingency plan has been designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment resulting from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste/materials or any of its constituents to the air, soil or surface water. The provisions of this plan will be carried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion or release of hazardous waste/materials or any of its constituent"

In the case an emergency situation that requires the activation of this plan arises, the discoverer shall contact the Emergency Coordinator.\n\n\n\nMr. Gilbert Rivera, Primary Emergency Coordinator, should be contacted first. In case he is not available, the following person in the list should be addressed. In any case, the order of the persons appearing on the list will be strictly followed for this notification process until someone is reached. The Primary Emergency Coordinator and alternates shall have complete authority to commit company resources in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n3.  Emergency Procedures and Implementation\n\nThe decision to implement the Contingency Plan depends upon whether or not an imminent or actual incident could threaten human health or the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Contingency Plan will be implemented in the following situations:\n\na) Fire and/or Explosion\n\ni) When the fire and/or explosion will cause the release of toxic fumes.\n\nii) When the fire spreads and could possibly ignite materials at other locations on site or could cause heat-induced explosions.\n\niii) When the fire could possibly spread to offsite areas.\n\niv) When the use of water or water and chemical fire suppressants could result in contaminated    runoff.\n\nv) When an imminent danger exists that an explosion could occur, causing a safety hazard due to lying fragments or shock waves.\n\nvi) When an imminent danger exists that an explosion could ignite other materials in the surrounding areas.\n\nvii) When an imminent danger exists that an explosion could result in the release of a toxic material.

The material should be contained immediately to prevent it from reaching areas such as water supply systems, sewers and private property. After containment, the material will be cleaned up (only trained personnel) and disposed of properly.\n\n\n\nOnce the necessary information has been collected, the communication of the spill to the responsible agencies will be initiated, if applicable and only by personnel authorized to perform these duties. If the spill or incident is beyond the capabilities of the internal response team, then the Emergency Coordinator will order evacuation of the premises if necessary and will contact a trained emergency response agency or, qualified HAZMAT contractor.\n\n\n\n- Action Procedures\n\nThis plan will be activated upon the occurrence of any spill related to the storage, us"

Notification\n\nIn the event of an imminent or actual emergency situation, the Emergency Coordinator will be notified first; subsequently, all emergency response personnel, appropriate agencies, and if their help is needed, civil defense, fire or police departments will also be notified. Authorization to contact regulatory agencies regarding any spill, will be limited to the following personnel, who must be contacted as soon as possible:\n\na) Mr. Gilbert Rivera - Primary Emergency Coordinator\n\nIf the above coordinator can not be reached within a reasonable time, the person in charge will contact Mr. Evangelista Ojeda, Plant Supervisor and Alternate Emergency Coordinator.\n\n\n\n6.  Identification of the Material\n\nThe Emergency Coordinator or person in charge will immediately identify the character, exact source, amount and extent of the release. The initial identification will be performed by visual inspection of the material and location of the release. For this purpose, all materials must always be properly identified and labeled and its location shall always be the same.\n\n\n\n7.  Assessment of the Release\n\nThe Emergency Coordinator will assess possible hazards, both direct and indirect to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire or explosion as well as a determination of whether the release is within the capabilities of the internal response team.\n\n\n\nThe safety of the personnel at the scene of a release of hazardous materials is critical to consider before"
