              "Description": "Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Portland, Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant (CBWTP) is subject to the Program 3 provisions of 40 CFR part 68 as it governed by OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As a result, CBWTP has audited the prevention program pursuant to OSHA standards and 40 CFR part 68.  The following is a description of the prevention program for the management of the chlorine facilities at the plant.\n\nIn addition to the PSM (described below), CBWTP has a Respirator Protection Team responsible for fit testing on Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), cartridge respirators Scram Packs, Skat packs, Toxilog operation, repair and maintenance of the equipment and reviewing the response procedure.\n\nThere are randomly scheduled drills on the response procedure.  Some drills cover just the response procedures, other drills are \"envelope drills\" where a set of conditions or circumstances are described.  Each drill includes a debriefing/critique of the drill, as well as a written report.  \n\nBrief description of chlorine process\n\nDomestic wastewater carries a variety of human pathogens. The organisms of greatest concern include the enteric bacteria, enteric viruses, and intestinal parasites.  Bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis, cholera, gastroenteritis, and shigellosis, as well as viral diseases caused by infectious hepatitis virus, poliovirus, coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, reoviruses, and adenoviruses may be contracted by contact with or by consumption of wastewater contaminated water supplies.  Disinfection is necessary to reduce transmission of these infectious diseases when human contact is probable.\n\nChlorination is used at this facility for disinfection of the clarifier effluent.  Chlorine is an effective disinfectant that is used at many wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nThe primary objective of effluent disinfection is to produce an effluent which meets the discharge limitations of less than 126 e coli per 100 milliliters, a monthly average based on a geometric mean, and 400 e coli per 100 ml.  The desired goal is to maintain a chlorine residual of less than the permit condition of 1 mg/l in the plant discharge to the river.  Dosing chlorine to the level that destroys all coliform organisms is undesirable due to the potentially adverse impact of chlorine and its by-products.\n\nChlorination is provided for disinfecting the plant effluent prior to discharge to the Columbia River.  The chlorine storage and feed facilities are located in the Chlorination Building.  Gaseous chlorine is fed under vacuum from the chlorinators located in the Chlorination Building to mechanical injectors in the tunnels. \n\nA major portion of the disease causing microorganisms is destroyed by a combination of the chlorine concentration in the wastewater and the hydraulic detention time provided in the discharge channel.  In general, the more efficiently the treatment plant is operated, the easier it will be to chlorinate the effluent.\n\nChlorine is brought to the treatment plant in 90 ton railcars and stored in a containment facility.  The containment facility provides physical containment for any liquid or gas leak in the rail car bays and in the equipment room where the chlorinators and evaporators are located.  Three scrubbers neutralize the contained chlorine.  Two of the scrubbers can remove 10,000 pounds of chlorine each from the rail car bays and the third can remove 150 pounds from the equipment room.  An alarm system will activate a local and remote audio alarm when the concentration of chlorine reaches 2 parts per million.\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided in the containment rooms and the chlorination room.  These units enable continuous monitoring of the air in the rooms for detection of chlorine leaks.  The chlorine leak detectors have a sensing range of 0 to 100 parts per million.   A high chlorine alarm is initiated if chlorine is detected in a room atmosphere at concentrations above 1 ppm, while a chlorine leak alarm is initiated if the chlorine concentration in one of the rooms reaches 5 ppm.  If a leak is detected, an alarm is sent to the control center, all of the ventilation fans in the chlorination building are turned off, all of the dampers in the building are closed, and the scrubber is activated.\n\nA simplified flow diagram is available to operations staff in the CL2 process safety manual and posted at other locations throughout the facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nA PSM audit was performed in 1995 by a consultant AcuTech Consulting.  The WG just finished a Process Safety Management (PSM) audit in May of 1999 by the engineering firm CH2M Hill.  This audit consisted of a detailed review of all of the elements in the PSM.  A follow up meeting was held and staff assigned to review the recommendations.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA hazard analysis was performed in 1995 by a consultant AcuTech Consulting using the HAZOP process.  A hazard analysis was again conducted in April 1999 by the engineering firm CH2M Hill using the same process.  HAZOP is a thorough systematic approach for identifying, evaluating and controlling the hazards in a process.  A team of highly skilled employees familiar with the chemical process has been assembled to review the audit and analysis recommendations.  The team will determine implementation strategies and assure that the recommendations are completed.\n\nIn addition to the PSM, CBWTP has a Respirator Protection Team responsible for fit testing on SCBA, cartridge respirators Scram Packs, Skat packs, Toxilog operation, repair and maintenance of the equipment and reviewing the response procedure. WG employees are highly skilled, trained and drilled on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a chlorine release. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe WG has written operating procedures that are consistent with the PSM information.  Operating procedures have been reviewed by two Operator II's in conjunction with a operations manager.  All three of them are very familiar with the system.  This review will be used to document this year's annual review.  An on line Operation and Maintenance Manual has been recently implemented to provide expanded access to operating and safety procedures.\n\nTraining\n\nThe dynamic nature of the industry requires that the WG invest in its employees' knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure that the organization and individuals reach full potential. WG employees are highly skilled, trained and drilled on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a chlorine release.  An annual drill is held with the local Fire Station as well as the HAZMAT team.  A training module program is being developed that enhances the existing program and verifies competency.  Contractors are provided training on the actions that will be taken if there is a chlorine response drill or a leak prior to any work being performed.  As part of our on going training program, our Respirator Protection Team is provides fit testing on Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), cartridge respirators Scram Packs, Skat packs, Toxilog operation, repair and maintenance of the equipment and reviews the response procedure.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe WG uses a computerized maintenance system that is work order based.  An employee identifies a problem, enters a work order, the appropriate craft is assigned for repairs, parts are obtained and the equipment is repaired.  A history of maintenance activities are stored on each piece of equipment to evaluate replacement or repair. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nExperience at other facilities has shown that changes made to equipment, systems, and processes have been the cause of numerous accidental releases.  The WG has a system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals and processing conditions.  Effective management will help minimize the chance for an accidental release.  A system that manages changes made to the   chlorination process will allow changes to be identified and reviewed before they are implemented to determine if the proposed change would compromise system safety.\nThe CBWTP staff will conduct a management of change (MOC) review for any temporary or permanent change, other than replacement-in-kind, affecting the chlorination process.  \n\nIn addition, any large project that would change the chlorination system includes an extensive review process.  This review takes place during project planning, various stages of design review, construction, inspection and start up.  Oversite of the steps is provided by a Capital Improvement Projects Management Group.\n\nPre-startup review\n\nA 13-point checklist has been developed for pre-start up.  The checklist us used to verify; that the construction and equipment meet design specifications, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate, a PHA has been completed and recommendations have been implemented, and employees have been trained.  Other items are specifically directed at safety equipment such as alarm systems are working, emergency equipment available and equipment checks completed.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nA compliance audit was performed by the engineering firm CH2M HILL on March 17, 1999.  The audit was conducted by reviewing Section III.A of OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A CH-1, dated September 13,1994, for all 14 elements of the OSHA PSM program. The Oregon PSM program and the OSHA PSM program are the same.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAfter each unplanned release and within 48 hours, a team of knowledgeable persons including members from operations, maintenance and management will be formed to investigate the circumstances of the release.  The investigation should determine the cause of the release and what actions were taken to stop it.  The team will identify measures to prevent future releases and make recommendations to implement those measures.  The team will provide a written report to the PSM manager.\n\nEmployee participation program\n\nOperator duties include checking the system periodically to verify safety and proper operation.  Employees have a representative on the WG's safety committee.  Tail gate safety meetings for each work group are held regularly and provide a forum for employer-employee consultation.  The WG has a written Safety Hazard reporting and Correcting Process providing opportunities for employees to document, evaluate and monitor safety concerns.  The Safety Committee monitors the status of all safety related work orders.  Employees have access to the O & M manuals, MSDS sheets and PSM.  Contractors are given information related to chlorine and the hazards associated with it as well as what to do in an chlorine emergency.\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nThe WG has a Hot Work Permit Policy which states that the purpose of this procedure is to establish a criteria to insure that all hot work operations are performed in a safe manner to prevent personal injury, fires, or equipment/property damage.  The policy contains procedures that include responsibilities for each work group, a fire watch, standards, training and special precautions..  Any time hot work is initiated an individually numbered permit must be filled out.  The permit includes a planning component, a check list, and signatures.  The permit is filed on site.",

      "SummaryText": "The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant-Portland, Oregon\n\nThe Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant (CBWTP) is a publicly owned wastewater treatment facility.  It was constructed in 1952 to provide primary treatment of wastewater in the City of Portland.  It was expanded to provide secondary treatment in 1974 and has the capacity to treat 100 million gallons a day (mgd).  The plant has an activated sludge facility and has a reuse program for biosolids. \n\nCBWTP is owned by the City of Portland and managed by the Bureau of Environmental Services Wastewater Group (WG).  The facility serves a population of over 432,000 with approximately 144,787 residential sewer and drainage customers and 12,844 commercial/industrial customers.\n\nThe Bureau of Environmental Services has 450 employees and an annual budget of $153 million.  The Bureau provides policy direction for regulatory programs associated with wastewater treatment and stormwater management.  Programs include industrial pretreatment and source control, water quality investigations and monitoring, watershed planning, combined sewer overflow design and construction, and environmental outreach and education programs.  \n\nAccident Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe City's Bureau of Environmental Services Wastewater Group (WG) is committed to:\n7 being proactive in the prevention of occupational risk and injuries/illnesses, \n7 protecting human, material and organizational wastewater resources, and \n7 preserving assets against detrimental loss.  \n\nThe WG has established a quality risk management philosophy that promotes employee involvement and accountability, and encourages a culture where safety and loss prevention is an internal value that is incorporated in every plan, decision and work activity. This philosophy extends to the health and well being of the community.\n\nNew chlorination facilities were constructed in 1992 to meet revised Uniform Fire Code requirements for emergency scrubbers.

Three scrubbers neutralize the contained chlorine.  Two of the scrubbers can remove 10,000 pounds of chlorine each from the rail car bays and the third can remove 150 pounds from the equipment room.  An alarm system will activate a local and remote audio alarm when the concentration of chlorine reaches 2 parts per million.\n\nThe WG also has a comprehensive chlorine response plan that includes a partnership with Portland Fire Bureau and more specifically the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nWG employees are highly skilled, trained and drilled on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a chlorine release.  The WG has received numerous safety and loss prevention awards and is recognized within the wastewater treatment industry as a leader in safety and loss prevention on the national, regional and local levels.  For example, in 1991 the WG received the Public Employer of Year Award from Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the American Society of Safety Engineers.  The award recognized efforts to create a safe and healthy employment for Oregonians.  The facility also received the National Safety Council Award, ranking 6th nationally in the Water Resource Division for occupational safety and health.  \n\nThe chlorine containment facility received two awards in 1992 from the Consulting Engineering Council of Oregon for Engineering Excellence.  One was the Project of the Year and the other was the Grand Award.  In 1997 the Pacific Northwest Water Pollution Control Association presented a Safety Award to the WG for leadership in occupational safety and health in the wastewater industry (the third award in six years).  In 1998 Portland City Council recognized the WG Safety Committee for continued efforts in safety and loss prevention and exceeding regulatory requirements for saf"

The facility is located at 5001 North Columbia Boulevard, Portland, Oregon 97203.\n\nThe liquid chlorine is stored in two 90-ton rail cars that are housed in a 50 by 70 foot chlorination facility that was constructed in 1992.  The chlorine is used in the final stage of treating wastewater to ensure that the effluent is disinfected before discharge to the Columbia River.  \n\nWorst-case release scenario and the alternative scenario\n\nThe RMP program requirements include the development of a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative scenario involving the accidental release of the regulated substance.  These results do not predict the results of a release and actual concentrations of the chemical may be lower than predicted by the model.  A brief description of each of the scenarios follows.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n\nFor worst-case scenarios, under EPA guidelines, accidental releases are assumed to take place without consideration for physical cause or likelihood of occurrence.  Only passive mitigation measures (e.g., dikes, buildings, and enclosures) can be considered, while active mitigation measures (scrubbers) can not be included. \n\nAt the CBWTP, liquid chlorine is stored in two 90-ton rail cars.  The cars are house in the chlorine facility built in 1992.  For the worst-case scenario, a catastrophic rupture of a one 90-ton rail car was evaluated to determine the distance to a specific endpoint concentration for a worst-case release of chlorine.  According to the rule, the toxic gas worst-case scenario must assume the release of the single largest vessel or container over a period of 10 minutes. However, because the rail cars are stored within a building, a passive mitigation factor"

      "SummaryText": " may be applied.\n\nThe chlorine in the railroad car tanks is stored under pressure so that the chlorine is in a liquid state.  When the chlorine is suddenly released, the depressurization causes the releasing stream to cool to the chlorine boiling point.  Therefore, a portion of the content flashes directly into vapor.\n\nThe worst-case release rate is the entire rail car content released within 10 minutes.  Since the cars are delivered to and kept in containment buildings, a building mitigation was included for this scenario.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance suggests a mitigation factor that reduces the release to 55 percent of the total amount that may be released in the scenario.  \n\nHowever, the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants provides a more sophisticated method for estimating the building mitigation factor that takes into account the flashing characteristics of a gas under pressure.  \n\nThe release was modeled as a transient release because the release time is less than the time it takes the cloud to reach the endpoint distance.\n\nThe distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 5.6 miles.  The population within the circle is estimated to be 157,456 people.\n \nEPA requires that public and environmental receptors, as defined by the rule, be identified.  Based on U.S. Geological Maps, Thomas registers, and other public media, the following public receptors were identified to be within the worst-case chlorine circle: residences, schools, hospitals (e.g.  Kaiser Permanente Interstate Medical Offices, Emanuel Hospital, Good Samaritan Hospital), a prison (Columbia River Correctional Institution), parks, recreational areas (Columbia River), commercial areas, industrial areas, and office areas.  The following environmental receptors were defined: Willamette Stone State Park, Fort Vancouver National Historical Site and the Sauvie Island Wildlife Area. \n\nAlternative scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario wa"

The release was assumed to occur in the chlorinator room near the evaporators and that the doors to the chlorinator room were open-which compromises the containment features of the facility.  This scenario was identified by the staff of CBWTP as a likely alternative release scenario for their facility. \n\nBecause the travel time to the endpoint distance (approximately 2 minutes) was less than the time of release (3 to 10 minutes), the release was modeled as a continuous release. \nThe distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 0.3 miles\nThe population within the circle is estimated to be 100 people.\n\nEPA requires that public and environmental receptors be identified.  Based on U.S. Geological Maps, Thomas registers, and other public media, only a few residences and some businesses were found to be within the alternative-case chlorine circle. No environmental receptors, as defined by the rule, were identified. \n\nChemical Prevention Steps\n\nThe WG has numerous written occupational safety and health programs. Programs specific to the chemical process are: process safety management (PSM), energy isolation, respiratory protection, emergency response, personal protective equipment and training/education.  The treatment plant has the containment facility with scrubbers that will neutralize releases.  The WG complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  An independent contractor performed a Hazardous Operations (HAZOP) Study in April 1999 and a PSM audit in May of 1999 for chlorine.  The Wastewater Group (WG) is actively taking the appropriate measures to implement the recommendations of both studies.\n\nAccident History\n\nThere has been one accidental release of chlorine in the last 5 years where an employee was injured.  The release was estimated at 5 pounds.  It was contained and neutr"

There were no off site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe WG staff will respond to unplanned events in a safe, prompt, and responsible manner.  The staff recognizes that each set of conditions will be unique, and unpredictable.  The goal of plant staff is to protect health and safety of the individual, coworkers and neighbors/community, plant equipment and continue to meet all discharge permit requirements.  In order to minimize the amount of chlorine that is released, the plant staff will close the valve at the point of discharge at the tank car.\n\nThe WG also has a comprehensive chlorine response plan that includes a partnership with Portland Fire Bureau and more specifically the Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Public notification of an accidental release is in conjunction with the public safety entities in the area.  Shelter in place, a response procedure requiring citizens to remain indoors with windows, doors and ventilation systems closed, is considered the most appropriate community protection.  The Wastewater Group will be actively discussing this program with the community.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nThe WG just had a process safety management audit in May of 1999 and a hazard analysis was conducted in April 1999 by the engineering firm of CH2M Hill.  A team of highly skilled employees familiar with the chemical process has been assembled to review the audit and analyze recommendations.  The team will determine implementation strategies and assure that the recommendations are completed.\n\nFor further information about the risk management plan and the wastewater treatment services provided by the City of Portland, please contact Tim Hall at 823-2410"
