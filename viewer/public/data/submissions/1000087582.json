Fresh Mark Salem's directors, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Fresh Mark Salem has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.
