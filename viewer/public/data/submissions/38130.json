Accordingly, OMI has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support. This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Taos WWTP Risk Management Plan for the ammonia system. OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Taos WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements. By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule. Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals. If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur. Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nOMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., ammonia at the Taos WWTP) and actively participated in comprehensive process hazard analyses. The employees that work on the ammonia system are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered process and the safe handling of the chemicals. They are aided in this work by complete, unders"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the \nTaos WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Taos WWTP is located at 182 Los Cordovas Road in Taos, New Mexico. The Taos WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations. The Taos WWTP utilizes ammonia to treat sludge and produce fertilizer. The ammonia is stored in one 12,000-gallon storage tank with a maximum intended inventory approximately 54,810 lbs onsite. Therefore, the Taos WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the ammonia stored and used at the facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Taos WWTP RMP manual. The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n? Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n\n? Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the hazards of the ammonia process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n\n? Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and"

Pre-startup safety review for additions or significant modifications to the ammonia process, or any new regulated chemical process\n\n? Compliance audits at least every 3 years from 1999 to evaluate Taos WWTP RMP compliance\n\n? Incident investigation to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia from the Taos WWTP\n\n? Employee participation in the development and implementation of the Taos WWTP RMP, and employee access to RMP information\n\n? Hot work prohibition policy on or near the ammonia system when ammonia is present in the effected section of the process\n\n? Contractor management program, to ensure appropriate evaluation and selection of qualified contractors for work on or near the ammonia system, proper notification of contractors regarding known ammonia system hazards and the Taos WWTP emergency evacuation plan, limited access to the ammonia process, and evaluation of contractor performance\n\nThe ammonia tank is located in a containment area to contain potential liquid releases.  Taos WWTP is currently planning to install ammonia detectors and a mist system to provide addition safety in case of a leak.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the 5-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of ammonia meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program and has contacted the local response agency, the Taos Fire Department, to coordinate actions.

The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Taos WWTP. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Taos WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted in 1999 and 2004. During the 1999 session, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Additional  recommendations were made as a result of the 2004 PHA revalidation.\n\nTaos WWTP has begun the installation of an ammonia storage building, ammonia leak detectors, and a mist system.   These safety systems will further increase the safety of the ammonia process."
