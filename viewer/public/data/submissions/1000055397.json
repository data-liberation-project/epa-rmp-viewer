If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the City of Laurinburg Fire Department as well as the Scotland County Department of Emergency Services, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Scotland County EMS and Scotland Memorial Hospital.  This facility has an Emergency Action Plan; however, does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Laurinburg & Southern Railroad Co., Inc. - Laurinburg & Southern Transload Terminal is a butane transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transloading system only, including the associated piping and thirteen (13) detached railcars.\r\n\r\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the transloading system's approximate 33,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (feasible scenario affecting off-site receptors) release scenario is an incident involving a railcar liquid valve failure.\r\n\r\nThe Laurinburg & Southern Railroad Co., Inc. - Laurinburg & Southern Transload Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120 for 1s"

This butane transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.  \r\n\r\nThis is an existing facility and, to date, has never had a reportable accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or shelterings in-place (defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42).\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Laurinburg & Southern Railroad Co., Inc. - Laurinburg & Southern Transload Terminal's butane transloading system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the City of Laurinburg Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility personnel are trained in incipient stage fire response and 1st Responder Awareness.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate departments include Stewartsville and Maxton) and the Scotland County Department of Emergency Services.  The City of Laurinburg Fire Department is aware of the system and its available fire protection systems (site fire extinguishers, hydrants and emergency shut-off devices).  The primary hazardous materials response capabilities are provided by the North Carolina Regional Response Team 3.\r\n\r\nImprovement  actions to be considered primarily focus on improved contractor/visitor programs and potential additions for transloader layers of protection (both engineering and administrative controls).  Other anticipated improvements include entrance information signage."
