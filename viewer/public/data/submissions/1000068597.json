Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n-Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Chooljian Brothers has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Chooljian Brothers, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Chooljian Brothers has developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                       | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity (lbs.)\n\nSulfur-Dioxide Dehydrating Process   Sulfur-Dioxide              8,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nChooljian Brothers operates a dehydrating facility that utilizes sulfur dioxide chambers to preserve fruit color during the drying process. Sulfur dioxide is piped from a ton-container to each of the twenty-four (24) chambers using stainless-steel hose, aluminum pipe, and valves. When in use, each chamber receives 75-90 lb of sulfur dioxide gas and then remains sealed for 6-7 hrs afterwards.\n\n\n\nThe sulfur dioxide process consists of four ton containers which are not interconnected. The containers are co-located relative to each other and therefore all sulfur dioxide ton containers, pipe, and valves are treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n\nRAGAGEP Statement\n\n\n\nThe process equipment was inspected during the 2018 PHA for the purpose of verifying that the process was designed, fabricated, and is being operated in accordance with applicable industry standards. It is unclear which codes and standards were followed in the design and construction gassing chambers. In the judgment of the PHA team, the process mostly closely aligns with CGA G-3 - 1995. This judgement was made because of the following:\n\n\n\nHose materials appear to comply with CGA G-3 - 1995 ?10.5 which requires hoses to be compatible \n\nwith sulfur dioxide\n\n\n\nTon containers comply with CGA G-3 - 1995 ?7 with regard to DOT specifications\n\n\n\nLack of documentation specifying codes and standards used at the facility\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of sulfur dioxide"

      "SummaryText": " in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nChooljian Brothers has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the sulfur dioxide dehydrating process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Sulfur-Dioxide\n\nThe sulfur dioxide process at the Chooljian Brothers facility is an integral part of overall business and lasts for approximately five months out of the year. The sulfur dioxide process contains multiple cylinders with a maximum inventory of 8,000 (lbs.). It is extremely important that these areas and associated injection processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Chooljian Brothers is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nOur personnel also monitor the sulfur dioxide dehydrating process and keep an active log of all associated procedures and transactions. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 cylinders. The contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our process equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nChooljian Brothers has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nChooljian Brothers' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administ"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nChooljian Brothers has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Chooljian Brothers continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Chooljian Brothers' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Chooljian Brothers' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nChooljian Brothers has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A li"
