Employees of the facility are trained in their roles and responsibilities in implementing prevention and emergency response.  Should an emergency occur, it is the company's policy to notify the Waterford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.\n\n2.\tStationary source and regulated substances handled:\nWoodworth Inc. is an Atmospheric Metal Heat Treating company. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a system for heat treating. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Woodworth Inc., has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n3.\tThe worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including the administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for release have been prepared and submitted as required.  This data may be viewed onsite.  \n\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nWoodworth Inc., has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of\nammonia from the Ammonia system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system. In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls wou"

Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with Waterford Fire Department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:\nThe Facility will train their employees on an ongoing basis.  The safety systems and preventive measures are constantly evaluated and improved.  This facility also expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of the PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia process.  Woodworth Inc. will evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
