Certification in these two voluntary programs serves as an indicator of the importance of these issues to site and corporate management.  SI Group Freeport also has its own site safety and environmental programs, as part of SI Group Performance System (SPS).  Engineering standards, such as ASTM and ANSI, are followed to ensure mechanical integrity in design and construction.\r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents involving RMP regulated flammable chemicals at this site that meet the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42(a) within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe site emergency response program is documented in the Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (ERCP), which serves as a consolidated emergency response plan.  The site is also a member of the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) organization and the Brazoria County Emergency Planning Committee (BCEPC) through which ER resources are shared and coordinated.  Our Emergency Response Coordinator regularly attends meetings of these organizations and also stays in contact with the Freeport Fire Department.
