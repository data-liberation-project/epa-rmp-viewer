An average of 975,000 pounds of liquid vinyl acetate monomer is also present in railcars on site in order to maintain efficient and continuous production.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case release scenario for an RMP listed toxic liquid at the Elkton, Maryland facility, as defined by the EPA, involves the release of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) from the failure of the largest vessel containing vinyl acetate monomer.  A VAM railcar, which has a theoretical capacity of 195,000 pounds, is the vessel that contains the largest quantity of VAM at our facility.  The actual working capacity is 190,000 pounds. The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine what off-site impact would result in the event of this release.  The worst case release scenario is highly unlikely due to several factors which include regular maintenance on the railcars to maintain vessel integrity, operator presence in the field to watch for leaks or spills while transferring and unloading the material from the top of the railcar through a standpipe as opposed to gravity feeding from the bottom of the railcar.\n\nThe alternate case scenario for VAM at our facility is the failure of a pipe while pumping vinyl acetate to a process vessel in the manufacturing facility.  This scenario could result in the release of 15,500 pounds of VAM.  Although there have been no instances of a release of this magnitude at the Elkton site, we have experienced small leaks around flanges and pump seals which indicate that this scenario might be possible and would be reasonable for emergency planning purposes.  The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine what off-site impact would result in the event of this release.  The alternate case release scenario is minimized by several proactive activities at the site which include"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Air Products Polymers, L.P., facility in Elkton, Maryland contains one RMP covered process which is \na vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing plant.  The plant must maintain greater than 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl acetate emulsions.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own strict environmental, health, and safety standards.  Air Products manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations. Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER regulation.\n\nAir Products is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Air Products is a member of the Chemical Manufacturer\u0012s Association and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The Elkton facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as the Cecil County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Montell/Air Products Community Advisory Panel.\n\n2.  The facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe polyvinyl acetate emulsions manufacturing facility is located at 329 West Main Street in Elkton, Maryland.  To produce polyvinyl acetate emulsions, vinyl acetate liquid is polymerized in reactors to form polyvinyl acetate emulsions.  The polyvinyl acetate emulsion is a non hazardous, water based liquid.  The product is then shipped by railcars, bulk trucks, totes and drums to industrial customers for the production of paint products, paper coatings and adhesives.  Approximately 350,000 pound"

In addition, the vinyl acetate unloading area contains spill pans and the ground is sloped to provide containment in the event of a spill in that area.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management regulation.  Air Products manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations.\n\nOur facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, fail-safe valves and dikes for the unlikely case of a potential leak.  Systems and equipment are designed  to engineering standards and codes.  Safety reviews are conducted prior to all projects and changes.  \n\nOur plant is operated safely by trained and certified operators who follow well maintained standard operating procedures with defined safe operating limits.  Routine process safety meetings are held for all personnel.  Investigations are conducted for all incidents to prevent recurrence.\n\nWe maintain operational safety through preventative maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  We hold contractors to the same high safety training standards as our employees.  We implement proactive task observation and accident prevention techniques on jobs.\n\nWe routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state, and local regulation.  We also have a comprehensive program to audit the plant\u0012s performance against corporate environmental and safety standards.

There have been no incidents at the facility that meet the EPA Risk Management Program reporting requirements.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u0012s emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u0012s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Cecil County LEPC and City Fire Departments for awareness on potential hazards and locations of materials at the site.  Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nAlthough we have no current plans to install new mitigation, control equipment nor to change technology, we are constantly striving for continued improvement in all aspects of environmental and safety performance.  Process safety is evaluated regularly through conducting operational plant hazard reviews and studying incidents which have occurred within the chemical industry."
