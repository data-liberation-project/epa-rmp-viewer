We will properly train, equip and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThis policy shall be communicated to all employees and made available to the public.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activities at Arclin are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced from the processing of methanol delivered to the plant via rail car and tank truck.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 53.5% by weight. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Arclin are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Arclin's program elements have been expanded to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Arclin's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine"

      "SummaryText": " whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nArclin Toledo had one release that resulted in minor property damage.  The main source of the property damage was material clean-up and replacement of the rupture disk.  Less than 50 pounds of formaldehyde was spilled September 4, 2004 when a pressure relief rupture disk released during the resin manufacturing process.  There were no injuries on or off site as a result of this event.\nArclin Toledo has had no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths or injuries at the facility, nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, off-site property or environmental damage.  \n\n\n \nEmergency Response Program\nArclin Toledo has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.  Arclin employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs."
