This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant, located in Rankin, Texas operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Panther Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. The Panther Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel (V-404) containing 338,520 pounds of NGL. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 mile. No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Panther Gas Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Panther Gas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the Panther Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific employees within the Panther Gas Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

For specific process areas, the Panther Gas Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Panther Gas Plant ensures that the process is maintained within instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Panther Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidated the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings form these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Panther Gas Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) supply contractors with a process overview, (6) information about safety and health hazards, (7) emergency response plan requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment function as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Change are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Panther Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in"

      "SummaryText": ", a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Panther Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Panther Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Panther Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. Summary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Findings The processes at the Panther Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations. \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities \r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP covered processes at the Panther Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and"

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in all closed compressor buildings\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare/vent system to handle episodic releases\r\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control\r\nsystem)\r\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n1. Fire extinguishers\r\n2. Personal protective equipment\r\n3. Spacing of equipment in accordance to spacing guideline.\r\n4. Emergency shutdowns strategically placed around the plant that automatically shuts in the inlet and outlet.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures. In addition the Panther Gas Plant has procedures that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to pe"
