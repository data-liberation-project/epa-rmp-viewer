These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices. These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the PSM covered pulping processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error. These measures help to ensure that all operators and mechanics are properly trained. Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are periodically reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.\r\nOther components of the prevention program include collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). The staff ensures that if equipment design deficiencies are identified that they are corrected. These actions will ensure that the equipment meets industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.\r\nTo ensure that Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, they are included in a training program. The training program includes Process Hazards Analyses, Operating Procedures, Maintenance Procedures, Emergency Response, and Safe Work Practices. \r\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill staff, with the assistance of a consultant, performed a PHA of the sulfur dioxide process at the appropriate intervals since 1993. A PHA of the chlorine dioxide process was initially performed in 1996 prior to startup and revalidations have been performed since then at the required intervals. Additional PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation also ensure the continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.

The site also has internal emergency response capability and has developed a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120. The current plan has been coordinated with the Wayne County Emergency Management Agency. \r\n\r\n6. Plans to Improve Safety\r\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill recently hired a new PSM Engineer who is assisting with further developing the PSM Program. \r\nThe Rayonier has recently revised and updated most of its major safety programs.\r\nA PSM Committee has been established and meets to ensure PSM related goals are being met.  \r\nThe Joint Safety and Health Committee continues to provide the Jesup Mill with tangible safety improvements primarily based on active participation and suggestions from employees.\r\nThe use of a new incident management system to better track action items relating to incident investigations, PHA recommendations, and audit findings."

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Rayonier Advanced Materials, Jesup Pulp Mill is located at 4470 Savannah Highway, Jesup, Wayne County, Georgia. Rayonier AM requires this facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site. The Jesup Mill is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site. A site PSM Coordinator is appointed to facilitate compliance. Rayonier AM's environmental, safety and training personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\r\n\r\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill is a three-mill, Kraft pulping complex involved in the manufacture of bleached dissolving pulp located in Wayne County, Georgia. As part of this manufacturing process, two regulated substances are above the threshold quantities and are covered by the RMP rule. The RMP-covered processes, chlorine dioxide and sulfur dioxide are Program Level 3 processes. Chlorine dioxide and sulfur dioxide are used as pulp bleaching chemicals in the Kraft  process. \r\n\r\n3. Prevention Program\r\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill exceeds the threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, for both sulfur dioxide and chlorine dioxide, therefore these processes subject to the PSM requirements. For RMP compliance purposes,\r\nthis places the pulping processes in the Program 3 level. The Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\r\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. It includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all PSM covered equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced. This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of ac"
