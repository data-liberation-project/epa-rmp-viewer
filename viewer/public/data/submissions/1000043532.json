Viskase utilizes the regulated chemical carbon disulfide in the cellulose food casing process.  Viskase's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Viskase's installation of  the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring detection systems.\n\n\n\nViskase's policy in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of carbon disulfide is to respond to the release with trained emergency personnel (Emergency Response Brigade).  Local emergency agencies will be contacted for assistance as well as necessary contractors as needed to respond, clean up and restore facility functions to normal.  Viskase adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nViskase complies with the Process Safety Management rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases.  The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employee participation.  The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the process and the equipment in the process is designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and that the process is operated according to good engineering practices.

      "SummaryText": " integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in the equipment.  Preventative maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident.   All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of carbon disulfide is prevented.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of carbon disulfide have occurred at Viskase in the past five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nViskase has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120) that includes provisions to respond to chemical emergencies on-site with trained Viskase personnel and provisions to evacuate non-responding employees from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical.   The emergency response team is trained to respond to chemical emergencies involving spills, fire, confined space rescue, etc. at the facility.  It is also Viskase's policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Viskase has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by Viskase and a joint decision will be made on whether local areas will be evacuated.  The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nViskase is committed to continuous efforts to improve the"
