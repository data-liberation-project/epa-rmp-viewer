Norton Ave., Sylacauga, Alabama, 35150 is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan regulations (called Risk Management Program or RM Program) to deal with the risks involved in the storage, handling, and processing of highly hazardous materials such as ammonia.  In this way we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, the PSM/RM Programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system consists basically of a cycle where liquid ammonia is evaporated while removing heat from the air or liquid surrounding it.  The ammonia is always contained inside tubes, pipes or vessels. The vapor is then compressed and condensed so that liquid ammonia returns back to the coolers to initiate the cycle again.\n \nWorst Case Release Scenario:\nThis scenario is unlikely to occur for the following reasons: worst case scenario conditions are uncommon; compliance with industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, in"

Also ammonia sensors are installed in the system to warn of leaks with alarms and an auto dialing system is in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets.  Finally, we have an emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n \nAlternative Case Release Scenario:\nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: the preventative maintenance program in place regularly maintains and inspects the piping and there are pressure relief valves and pressure regulators that prevent sudden pressure increase. We regularly have personnel present around this equipment, moreover the ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks. Finally we have an emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nOur general accidental release prevention program complies with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68, ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems as follows:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nTo involve the employees in establishing the PSM program.  Employees have complete access to the PSM program.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nTo enable the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  It includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the ammonia refrigeration system design.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\nTo review and study the Process to identify potentially hazardous events or possible problems in operations.  Analyzes potential deviations from design conditions.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nDetailed description of the steps to be followed to operate safely the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining:\nTo train the employees on all aspects of operation of the system and their respective duties to ensure the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system operation.\n\nContractors:\nTo screen and evaluate the contractors before they perform work on or near the ammon"
