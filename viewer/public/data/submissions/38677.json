We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  This facility is subject to Program 3 of the Risk Management Program because it is also subject to OSHAA?s Process Safety Management regulations.   If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is water treatment.  We receive chlorine in 1-ton cylinders.  These cylinders inject chlorine into to the water for disinfection purposes.  Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this facility is 10,000 pounds (5 cylinders). \n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPAA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with industry standards.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our chlorine storage facilities.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nWe conduct reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled eff"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWe maintain written operating procedures for operation of the chlorine facility.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators.\n\nTraining\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. A Chlorine Emergency Rensponse Team (CERT) has been created and provided with 40 hours of training related to Chlorine emergencies, addionally 18 hours of training is provided every year to team members.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWe perform annual maintenance and monthly inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Basic visual inspections are performed by facility operators on a more frequent basis.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: Chlorine leak detector and related alarms, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems.  Maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel that have been trained in safe maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWhenever a change in process occurs, our management of change procedures ensure that we evaluate the impact on health and safety, modify the operating procedures and safety information as necessary, and inform and train our employees.\n\nPre-Startup Review\nWhenever a process change is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the management of change procedures, we will perform a pre-star"

The pre-startup review includes a confirmation of design specifications, operating procedures, process hazard analysis and employee training.\n\n \nCompliance Audits\nWe conduct compliance audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are performed at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nWe have consulted with employees and their representatives regarding development of the Process Hazard Analysis and other elements of process safety management to ensure that they have access to all information to be developed under this rule.\n\nHot Work Permit\nWe have a Hot Work Permit program in place to meet the requirements of OSHA 29CFR1910.252(a).  This program minimizes the likelihood of an accidental fire by requiring planning and preparation for hot work conducted on or near a covered process.\n\nContractors\nIn order to ensure a safe facility, we check the safety performance of all contractors that work on our facility.  Contractors are trained in the hazards associated with the covered processes and are trained in safe working practices.\n\nFive-year accident history\nDue to our comprehensive safety program, this facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n"
