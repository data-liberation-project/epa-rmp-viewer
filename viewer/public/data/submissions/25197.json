In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nTerragro's Mission states, to provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public.  In order to fulfill this mission, Terragro provides an internal group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety environmental program and procedures.  Terragro personnel, continue auditing and monitoring facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state and local regulations are covered.  Terragro conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those govering the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe location has a site safety coordinator.

It should be noted that Terragro has never had a release of this type from a distribution facility.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989) OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails.  All main storage tank valves and the riser loard valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coo"

This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition Terragro has an employee Emergency and Fire Plan that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nWe will install cement filled, steel pipes every 6' around the storage tank.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."

We store and distribute anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, handled and stored on-site.  Ammonia is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 1 stationary storage tank (1 @ 18,000 gallons) on site.  The maximum storage capacity fo the stationary storage tank is 79,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 79,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 79,000 pounds.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 -gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quanity released would be 79,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that Terragro has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank from any facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distanc"
