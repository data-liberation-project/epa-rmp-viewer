This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Olathe Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one extremely hazardous substance present at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management Planning regulations.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements is 19,245 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSysco Food Services of Kansas City has taken the following steps as required by 40CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility:\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nSysco Food Services of Kansas City believes that process safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as a part of the implementation of the RMP regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently and safely.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nSysco Food Services of Kansas City uses the What-If Checklist method of Process Hazard Analysis to identify and correct any issues that can affect the safety and/or mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A team of personnel representing engineering, construction, operations, safety, management and labor convene at least every 5 years to complete or revise the Process Hazard Analysis.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nSysco Food Services of Kansas City maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nSysco Food Services of Kansas City has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.

Sysco Food Services of Kansas City has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the ammonia refrigeration system.  Contractors are also trained regarding the procedures for emergency notification, evacuation and employee accountability, should an accidental release of Ammonia (anhydrous) occur.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications of established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Sysco Food Services of Kansas City.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSysco Food Services of Kansas City carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.
