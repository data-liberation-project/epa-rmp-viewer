      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe chemical manufacturing industry synthesizes many products which provide benefits enjoyed by our society.  These include plastics, adhesives, paints, fuel additives, and agricultural chemicals just to name a few.  The manufacture of many of these products unavoidably uses substances regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68).  In using, storing  and handling these regulated substances, Chevron Chemical Company's Orange, Texas Facility, recognizes the potential for community and environmental receptors exposure.  Because of concern over the potential impacts of accidental releases to the community and the environment, the Orange, Texas Facility's Management is committed to full compliance with the requirements of the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nChevron Chemical Company's Orange, Texas Facility management demonstrates its commitment to safety and the environment by enforcing Chevron's Corporate Policy 530.  Policy 530 states that the Company will conduct scientific hazards assessments, as needed, to identify, characterize, and safely manage any potential hazards of company operations.  Additionally, the Orange, Texas Facility demonstrates its commitment to process safety management through active implementation of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Careb Program.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nChevron Chemical Company's Orange, Texas Facility located on FM 1006, Orange, Texas, manufactures high and low density polyethylene plastics.  These plastics are used to manufacture consumer products such as milk bottles, trash bags, plastic piping, etc..\n\nThe manufacture of high density and low density polyethylene plastics at the Orange, Texas Facility require the use of the following regulated chemicals:\n\nEthylene - Ethylene gas (CAS 74-85-1) is the primary raw material in the manufacture of low density a"

Ethylene molecules polymerize under the presence of a catalyst or an initiator to form polyethylene.\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer - Vinyl Acetate Monomer (CAS 108-05-04) is a co-monomer used in the manufacture of low density polyethylene (LDPE).  This monomer is used to adjust the density of the plastic and is part of the various specialty polymers LDPE formulations.\n\n1-Butene - 1-Butene (CAS 106-98-9) is a co-monomer used in the manufacture of high density polyethylene (HDPE). This co-monomer is used to adjust the density of the plastic.\n\nIsopentane - Isopentane (CAS 78-78-4)  is used to prepare a catalyst mixture which is used in the manufacture of  high density polyethylene.\n\nIsobutane - Isobutane (CAS 75-28-5) is a diluent or carrier agent used in the manufacture of high density polyethylene.  This substance is not generally involved in the chemical polymerization reaction.\n\nPropane - Propane (CAS 74-98-6) is used in the high density polyethylene manufacturing process as a refrigerant.  Propane is used to condense various substances in the process such as ethylene, isobutane and isopentane.\n\nn-Butane - n-Butane (CAS 106-97-8) comes in mixed with the isobutane which is used as a diluent in the manufacture of high density polyethylene.\n\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\nVinyl Acetate:  190,000 lbs\n1-Butene:   310,000 lbs\nIsopentane:   210,000 lbs\nEthylene:   120,000 lbs\nIsobutane:   780,000 lbs\nPropane:   280,000 lbs\nn-Butane:   440,000 lbs\n\n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nToxic Worse Case Scenario:\n\nThe only regulated toxic substance in the facility is Vinyl Acetate (VA). The following scenario was selected to be \"worst case\" for a toxic release:  \n\nThe maximum quantity of vinyl acetate in V-926-9, 96\" OD x 24' seam to bottom (8,580 gal or 66,800 lbs), is released and forms a liquid pool in the diked area around the tank.

The 8,580 gallons of VA is based on having administrative controls, (written procedures), in place to limit the quantity of material in the tank.   The downwind distance to the ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guidelines) concentration of 75 ppm is based on the EPA look-up tables and is predicted to have off site impacts.  Worst case weather conditions are assumed to be \"F\" stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, (night or early morning with calm winds).  \n\nFlammable Worse Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst case flammable scenario by EPA definition is a vapor cloud explosion of the single vessel with the greatest amount of flammable material.  For the Orange plant, the vessel with the potentially largest quantity of flammable material is V-1405-502, 144\"ID x 56'8\" tangent to tangent with a capacity of 51,600 gallons of 1-butene.  Using the EPA look-up tables, the distance to a 1.0 psi blast overpressure is predicted to have off site impacts. \n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nToxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe release scenario selected for the toxic alternative release scenario is the following:\n\nThe truck unloading hose for the VA truck ruptures and releases material in the containment area around the truck.    The release is through the entire 2\" diameter hose, (or equivalent), and spills the contents of the average truck load, (8,000 gallons).  Material that starts collecting in the unloading area starts to flow into the tank field diked area through an underground line.  A pool of VA forms in both the unloading area and tankfield and is assumed to entirely \"wet\" the both containment areas.  The downwind distance to ERPG-2  is predicted to go of site  and is based on the EPA look-up tables and uses more typical weather conditions. \n\n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario\n\nSome specific scenarios that were analyzed include:\n\n1. Release of a flammable material and forming a flammable vapor cloud\n2. "

Scenarios types 1 & 2 did not go off-site and would not be candidates for submitting as an alternative release scenario.  It was decided that a VCE would be a more likely incident, (even though a very low probability), than a BLEVE.  The vessel with the longest distance for a vapor cloud explosion is V-501, with a quantity of 51,270 gallons.

The management systems used to comply with the OSHA PSM requirements comprise the accident release prevention program for this facility.\n\nIn general, the accidental release prevention program includes programs in the following general categories:\n\nSafety In Design\n\n7 Use of applicable codes and CCC Technology Standards meet or exceed regulatory standards\n7 Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity \n7 Fire water monitors are strategically located\n7 Pumps and compressor systems are designed to minimize releases\n7 Tanks are nitrogen purged to reduce the potential for a fire or explosion\n7 Unloading hoses are designed to resist chemical attack\n7 Backflow from tanks is minimized by use of check valves\n7 Equipment is electrically grounded to prevent sparks\n7 Dikes, curbs and drains are designed to collect/contain spills\n\nSafety In Operations\n\n7 Operational Safety Standards are incorporated into procedures and facilities as appropriate\n7 Operators are trained on proper unloading procedures\n7 Technical resource people are available around the clock\n7 Trucks meet "
