This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur at Lone Star NGL LLC Fractionators West (FRAC West), our response activities are coordinated with Baytown Police Department.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe FRAC West RMP-regulated activities consist of extraction and fractionation. The plant is designed to separate pipeline natural gas liquids to produce ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane and natural gasoline.  Natural gasoline and fractionated pure components are recovered from this process for off-site sales.\r\nThe FRAC West Facility separates pipeline natural gas liquids to produce the following pure components:\r\n1.\tEthane\r\n2.\tPropane\r\n3.\tN-Butane\r\n4.\tIsobutane\r\n5.\tNatural Gasoline\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLonestar maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nLonestar has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with theses processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLonestar carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detectors, and temperature and pressure switches. Maintenance operations are carried out\r\nby qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Lonestar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, and any administrative change that could impact safety and health.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established proce"

These audits will be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions requires required as result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nLonestar promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release form release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nLonestar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
