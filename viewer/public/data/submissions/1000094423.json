The facility is located in an industrial area of Merced County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration system. The total ammonia inventory in Process 1 at 17,500 lbs. exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a direct, mechanical closed loop process. The facility was built prior to 1981 and modified since then.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia equipment is located in a machinery room, outside and in the refrigerated rooms.\n\n\n\nA-3  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures. The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation.

Various other safety programs and procedures are included.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the SDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and the individual's role in the emergency response plan or action plan.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.   Inspections, and ongoing maintenance based on industry standards are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping systems,\n\nrelief/vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps etc.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Management of Change MOC)procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informe"

This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo insure that all the other areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and CUPA.\n\n\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\n\nThis permit "

Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. Maintenance reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operation and the fire watch is completed.\n\n\n\nContractors and Contractor Qualifications\n\nThis site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The facility incorporates a third party (ISN) to assist in these requirements. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere were no reportable ammonia releases at this facility during the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION/RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Action Plan developed for this facility for flammables, fire, earthquake, hazardous materials and other emergencies.\n\nFacility personnel have coordinated with responding outside agencies such as Los Banos Fire and the Merced County Environmental Health Department, Division of Environmental Health. The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies.\n\n\n\nThe facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills and attendance at Ammonia Safety Days.
