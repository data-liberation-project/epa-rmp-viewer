The total ammonia inventory in the process at 16,600 lbs. exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\n\nThe refrigeration system is a direct, mechanical closed loop refrigeration system. The facility was built in 1988 and then expanded in 1996 and again in 2013.\n\nThe ammonia equipment is in a machinery room (engine room), outside and in the refrigerated rooms.\n\nA-3 \tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s) include administrative controls and mitigation measures. The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition, Process 1 components are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore, as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nA-4\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia Dairies Inc.

Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied, and appropriate corrective action taken.\nSee the Prevention Program Element 9 for the complete guidelines. \nThe supporting and completed documents are filed electronically and maintained on APSM website.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community.  As a rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\nSee the Prevention Program Element 10 for the complete guidelines. \nThe supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Safety & Training Manager's Office and on APSM website.\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. Maintenance reviews and issues permits to ensure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operation and the fire watch is completed.\n\nSee the Prevention Program Element 11 for the c"
