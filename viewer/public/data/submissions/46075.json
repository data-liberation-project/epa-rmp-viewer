      "SummaryText": "DSM Desotech, Inc., Stanley, NC\n\nFacility Description and Operations\n\nThe DSM Desotech, Inc. facility in Stanley, North Carolina formulates and manufactures ultraviolet light (UV) and electron beam (EB) cured coatings and resins that are used by various industries in a multitude of applications. For example, one specific industry that frequently uses DSM\u00bfs products is the fiber-optic cable industry. The Stanley, North Carolina facility houses offices, a research and development laboratory, manufacturing activities, and a warehouse for raw materials and finished product.\n\nProduction of the coatings is completed in a process that is analogous to cooking from a recipe. For a given batch of product that is being produced, there is a specification (similar to a recipe) that dictates the raw materials used, the procedures for mixing them together, and how to complete the reaction. Weigh tanks (similar to measuring cups), blend tanks (similar to mixing bowls) and reactors (similar to pots and pans) are used in the process. Reactions typically take 12 to 24 hours to complete, and when the reaction is finished, the original raw materials have been polymerized. Polymerization is the same process that causes liquid cake batter to become a solid cake once it is baked. In this case, DSM\u00bfs products are only partially polymerized. Final polymerization and the formation of a solid \u00bfdry\u00bf coating happens only upon product exposure to ultraviolet light (u.v.) in a customer\u00bfs process.\n\nBecause of the time required to complete a batch of product, DSM production is completed over six 24-hour days.\n\nIn 2006, a change to lower the storage temperatures affected the results of offsite consequence analyses, prompting a revision to the facility\u00bfs RMP.\n\nMaterials\n\nDSM Desotech employs a variety of organic chemicals in the production of UV/EB coatings and resins. General classes of chemicals used include acrylates, polyols, isocyanates, monomers, photoinitiators, inhibitors and diluents. In addi"

TDI is listed as a toxic liquid. The threshold quantity of TDI for RMP applicability is 10,000 pounds in any single process. Processes that were identified to be subject to RMP based on the quantity of TDI in the process consist of delivery/unloading and storage. Although TDI is received and stored in quantities that exceed the RMP applicability threshold, there are no product formulations that require an excess of 10,000 pounds of TDI to be used to produce a batch of product.\n\nRelease Scenarios were removed from the Executive Summary in accordance with the April 9, 2004 Federal Register.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at the site from the regulated processes within the last five years that resulted in either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nDSM has established procedures in case of an emergency at the facility. These procedures assign responsibility for implementing the emergency response plan, assuring safety of onsite workers, notifying the proper authorities, and coordinating any necessary cleanup and/or decontamination activities. The Stanley Fire Department and the Gaston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been notified of DSM\u00bfs emergency response procedures.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nDSM has established a series of safe work practices that are used to minimize the likelihood of a hazardous material release. Practices are updated or added as necessary to address any newly identified hazards. In the event of a release, passive mitigation (i.e., dikes, building enclosure) is available to prevent"
