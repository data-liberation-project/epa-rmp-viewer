The Temple WTP is a conventional water treatment plant which provides drinking water for all of Temple as well as the cities of Morgan's Point Resort, Little River Academy and Troy. \n\nA new water treatment plant (WTP), yet to be named, was brought on line on January 1, 2004. The only process in the new WTP is microfiltration using membranes. Chlorinated water from Temple WTP is pumped to the new WTP, micro-filtered and sent to storage and distribution. The new WTP provides additional treatment/purification capacity to the Temple WTP. If a chlorination system is installed in the new WTP, a RMP will be submitted prior to bringing the chlorination system on-line. \n\nThe water treatment process at the Temple WTP, as regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), requires the addition of chlorine to the drinking waster as a disinfecting agent. The Temple WTP stores chlorine, liquefied under pressure, in one-ton containers in an enclosed building.  The maximum chlorine storage capacity is 54,000 pounds. Chlorine gas is withdrawn and fed into the process by a vacuum induction unit. As required by the RMP regulation, the Temple WTP has updated the Offsite Consequence Analysis and reported it to EPA using RMP*Submit 2004.\n\n3.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Temple WTP recognizes the potential dangers associated with the accidental release of chlorine and therefore, has implemented appropriate safety measures to minimize any risk to the community associated in the event of an accidental chlorine release. The safety measures include a large capacity chlorine scrubber installed in Jan 2003, automatic shut-off system to stop chlorine withdrawal, process area chlorine leak detectors connected to audio and visual"

As such, Temple WTP operates the process safely, reducing to the greatest extent practicable any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and City of Temple Fire Department to implement the emergency response program, in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Temple WTP. \n\nThe Temple WTP is subject to the Program Level 2 of the RMP regulations. The Temple WTP's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies comply with the RMP rule requirements. Specific handling, operation and maintenance, and emergency response procedures have been developed for the storage of chlorine and the chlorination process.  The Temple WTP\u00bfs personnel that work with chlorine storage and chlorination process are thoroughly trained in the aspects of safe handling, operation, maintenance, and emergency response actions as required by the RMP regulation. \n\nThe Temple WTP proactively installed a chlorine scrubber in January 2003 to minimize the effect of an accidental release of chlorine on the surrounding community. The Temple WTP has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response and has coordinated emergency response with the City of Temple Fire Department. The City of Temple Fire Department is staffed around the clock with trained firefighters and hazmat personnel and are fully equipped to respond to emergencies.  \n\nTo date, the Temple WTP has an excellent accident-free record of chlo"

Preventive maintenance is performed on the chlorination process, including the appurtenances such as hoist and cables used to move the chlorine containers. The chlorination equipment is designed according to industry standards, is regularly inspected and maintained in good working order by qualified operators. The operators are well trained in the handling and use of chlorine. The operators are also trained in the actions to be taken during an emergency and receive regular safety training. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n3.1  Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine, chlorination process, and the chlorination equipment. The safety information was reviewed in July 2003.\n\n3.2  Hazard Review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. Hazard review was updated using a What-if and Checklist in June 2004. \n\n3.3 Operating procedures, that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with the chlorine storage and chlorination process. The operating procedures were reviewed in July 2003.\n\n3.4 Training for each employee involved in operating the chlorine system. Most recently refresher training was provided to employees in December 2003.\n\n3.5 Maintenance procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment. The maintenance procedures were reviewed in June 2003.\n\n3.6 Compliance audits at least every three years from 1999 to evaluate the Temple WTP's Risk Management"

The last compliance audit was conducted in May 2002.\n\n3.7 Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine.\n\n4.0  Five-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42. The Temple WTP has an excellent safety record for use of chlorine. There have also been no employee injuries associated with the use of chlorine.\n\n5.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Temple WTP's emergency response program is coordinated with the City of Temple Fire Department. In the event of a chlorine accident, the operators would shut down the chlorination process as efficiently as possible. The City of Temple Fire Department would be notified and respond to any chlorine emergency. The City of Temple Fire Department personnel are fully trained in dealing with chlorine and other chemical releases and have been provided with the proper equipment for mitigating an accidental release. \n\n6.0  Planned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nThe Temple WTP plans to address the only hazard review finding, that of replacing wood chock blocks for the chlorine containers with metal chock blocks, in the next couple of months."
