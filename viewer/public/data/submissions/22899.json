Also within the 0.43 mile radius are: Purks Elementary\r\nSchool, with 400 students, Stone-Smurfit Corporation and several other businesses and churches.\r\n\r\nThe only passive mitigation in this scenario is the containment dike, which limits the exposed\r\nsurface area.  The plant also has a white mineral oil system that can be used to blanket the oleum,\r\ninhibiting the release of fumes from any spills inside the dike.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario   Regulated Toxic Chemical - Oleum\r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario is the rupture or severance of the pipeline used for unloading rail cars into\r\nthe storage tank.  This would result in the uncontrolled release of oleum at a rate of 100 gallons\r\nper minute for approximately two minutes onto the paved lot between the car and the tank.  The\r\natmospheric conditions, as prescribed by the regulation, would be:\r\n\r\nWind speed - 1.5 meters/second          Temperature - 25 C\r\nStability Class - F                Relative Humidity - 50.0%\r\n\r\nThe estimated distance to the exposure end point is 0.31 miles from the tank.

Purks \r\nelementary school and most of the churches and other businesses are not affected under this\r\nscenario.\r\n\r\nMitigation controls on this scenario are a low flow alarm and shutoff on the unloading pump,\r\nslopes and interceptor drains that would limit the exposed surface area of the liquid and valves\r\nthat are normally kept closed to keep the liquid in the trenches.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario   Regulated Toxic Chemical - Formaldehyde\r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario is the rupture or severance of the pipeline used for unloading rail cars into\r\nthe storage tank.
