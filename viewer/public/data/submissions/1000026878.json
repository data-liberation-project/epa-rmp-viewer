      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - This Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The stationary source is the Associated Wholesale Grocers distribution center located at 5000 Kansas Avenue, Kansas City, KS.  The site is owned by Associated Wholesale Grocers and is operated by them.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia - which is classified as a toxic substance, liquified under pressure.  This is a RMP update for an existing cold storage system with two refrigeration systems.  These processes do not meet the requirements of Program 1.  They are subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY - This facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community and the environment.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY - The facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  The plan is provided to the local LEPC for review.  PROCESS OVERVIEW - This food distribution facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems.  The systems operate to cool air temperatures in a food storage warehouse.  Products stored are typical refrigerated grocery items.  The refrigeration systems use anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant.  MITIGATION MEASURES - There are some mitigating measures in place.  The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine rooms.  Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off.  Ammonia lea"

      "SummaryText": "k detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation.  The energency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders.  It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM - This facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP.  Following is an overview.  Participation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents.  Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs and evacuation procedures.  All employees have access to the PSM Program.  Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.  Community involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the the local fire department and LEPC.  Process Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals and process information.  These are available to employees that operate, maintain or repair the process equipment or piping.  There are three major categories of information:  ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and"

Process Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the What-if technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact.  The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.  Standard Operating Procedures - SOP's are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot and evaporator.  Topics include general information items such as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments.  The SOP's cover different phases of operations such as:  initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.  Training - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.  Contractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system.  The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contr"

      "SummaryText": "actors understand their responsibility and train their people and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.  Pre-Startup Review - Pre-startup reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.  This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.  Mechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, energency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Hot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area.  The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met.  Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done.  The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.  Management of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even replacement in kind) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect.  The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.  Incident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia.

Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team.  The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.  Emergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Compliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all the other 12 areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be completed every three years.  Resubmission of the RMP shall be done according to Section 6.2 to meet the OCA requirements.  Accident History - Last Five Years - There have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety - Associated Wholesale Grocers is the operator of this facility.  We continually review the PSM and RMP programs and are proactive in ensuring all measures taken afford the best integrity of our system."
