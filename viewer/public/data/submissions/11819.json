      "SummaryText": "This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local fire department by calling 804-352-5212.  This facility is a LP-Gas pumping station.  LP-gas is delivered to the facility by bobtail trucks and distributed to our customers by delivery truck (Chevy S-10).  We fill mostly 1000 lb. DOT containers on site and exchange full containers for empty containers at the customers home.  Our customers use propane mainly for heating and cooking.  Our worst-case scenario consists of a loss of the contents of our largest (1,000 gallon) storage tank followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The overpressure of 1 psi would encompass a circle with a radius of .1 (one-tenth) of a mile.  There are two homes within the distance to endpoint and the explosion could affect 5 people.  The alternate scenario is the release and explosion of the contents of the bobtail unloading hose.  The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.03 miles.  About 2 people in 1 residence could be affected.  This facility has had no releases of LP-gas during the last five years.  My employees have been trained using the National Propane Gas Association Certified Employee Training Program (CETP) using the moduals indicated in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities.\"  Our local fire company has visited the facility and the local firemen have been trained to control a propane fire.  The facility does not have its own emergency response plan.  There are no plans to improve safety at this facility.  We realize there has been a stay on RMP Submit as of this date 5-12-1999 so this is strictly a voluntary submission."
