The aqueous ammonia systems are monitored during (at least) daily rounds by a the High Desert Power Plant employee.  Typically, the High Desert Power Plant operators perform cursory facility inspections twice per shift, or six times per day.  Once identified, the High Desert Power Plant will fix or outsource any system deviation that is noted.  In any case, a record of the maintenance or work performed on the system is maintained by the Plant Supervisor.\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, aqueous ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year in conjunction with the Emergency Business Plan for the Victorville Fire \nDepartment .  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Victorville Fire Department.  In the case of an aqueous ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of the High Desert Power Plant to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance o"

The High Desert Power Plant also plans to contract with a private company to respond to any hazardous materials spills.\n\nB.STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant is located at 19000 Perimeter Road in Victorville, California.  The facility is situated Northwest of Interstate 15 off the D Street exit.  The immediate area is primarily industrial and rural.  The location for storing aqueous ammonia is in the southerly side of the property.  Ammonia sensors provide an alarm status to the control room which is manned 24 hours per day.  The High Desert Power Plant is a 750 MW unit that will be placed in commercial operation in May 2003.  The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system scheduled completion date is in January 2003.  The facility uses 25% aqueous ammonia to catalytically reduce boiler flue gas nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and uses 19% aqueous ammonia to control the pH level of the condensate.\n\n25% aqueous ammonia is used as a catalyst in the SCR system to assist in controlling the NOx emissions from the stack.  It is the only CalARP regulated substance on site.\n\nThe maximum inventory of 25% aqueous ammonia at the High Desert Power Plant is 39,300 gallons (308,702 pounds).\n\nC.HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary (OAC1)\n\nScenario Description:   Release of the maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (the liquid storage tank) - 39,300 gallons of 25% solution (308,702 pounds) in 10 minutes.  The liquid is assumed to leak into the concrete berm (passive mitigation) that surrounds the tank and then evaporate (rate = 90 lbs/min) at the highest daily temperature in the last three years.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.

No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nNote: The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance reference tables yield the same result.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary (OAC2)\n\nScenario Description:   A release of aqueous ammonia resulting from the failure of a pressure relief valve to reseat.  The release rate of the ammonia vapor is calculated to be 4.6 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release does not reach off site and does not impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nD.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the High Desert Power Plant is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the High Desert Power Plant operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The CalARP Program included detailed hazard review to identify potential release scenarios, an analysis of the potential consequences associated with select release scenarios and a detailed seismic inspection of the aqueous ammonia process equipment.  In addition to the technical studies, the CalARP Program incorporated preventive programs such as detailed operating and maintenance procedures, incident investigation, training, auditing, and emergency response activities.  Finally, the aqueous ammonia processes are inspected by operators every two hours.\n25% Aqueous Ammonia\n\nThe High Desert Power Plant maintains ti"

In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there are three mechanisms at the facility to minimize the impact:  1) a containment berm surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank sized to hold the entire contents of the tank, 2) an underground storage tank to contain any spills during the unloading process, and 3) both the storage tank and the underground containment tank are double-walled.  There are level controls on the storage tank to alert the operator to extreme level conditions. \nE.FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBoth the aqueous ammonia treatment systems and the entire plant is new as of January 2003; therefore, there is no accident history to report.\n\nF.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility:\n\n1.First call 911 on an internal/land line phone for the Victorville Fire Department and  police department.  The Victorville Fire Department can also be reached at (760) 955-5227 and the Victorville Police Department at (760) 241-2911. \n\n2.Contact either the Start-up Manager (Jim Hunt) or the Assistant Start-up Manager (Dale Bjorklund) immediately.  If they are not available, contact the Shift Supervisor or Safety Manager (John Herreth).\n\n3.Call the Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) Warning Center 1-800-852-7550.\n\n4.If additional help is required for an aqueous ammonia spill or leak, the facility can call Chemtrec - Manufacturing Chemists Association 1-800-424-9300.\n\n5.If an aqueous ammonia release exceeds 1000 pounds or 135 gallons, call the National Response Center 1-800-424-8802 [24 hours, 7 days].\n\n6.If serious injuries or harmful exposures to workers occurs, call the nearest Cal-OSHA Office at (909) 383-4321.\n\n7.If an employee ingests aqueous ammonia, the Poison Control Center can be reached 24 hours per da"
