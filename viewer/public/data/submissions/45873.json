The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Ammonia Plant in Laddonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Laddonia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. \n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored in our bulk tanks would be 224,314 pounds. The largest single tanks quantity would be 84,118 pounds in either of our 18,000 gallon storage tanks. The location also has two 6,000 gallon storage tanks at the facility. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  The facility has fifty-seven 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and three tank applicators, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 478,569 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our"
