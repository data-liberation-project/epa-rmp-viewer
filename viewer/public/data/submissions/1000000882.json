Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Nestle to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Nestle will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nOur ammonia safety program is a key item in the plant safety and health program.  Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Factory Engineer is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle's Springville Plant produces frozen food products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Springville Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Inf"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Springville Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Springville Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\no Fire Plan\no Ammonia or Gas Leak Procedures\no Evacuation Procedures\no Responsibilities of the Emergency Response Team\n\nThe program has been coordinated with the Springville Fire Department.\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTwenty-two changes were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia system was analyzed in 2005.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and were implemented as appropriate."
