      "SummaryText": " this summary describes OIMS.  Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe Intercontinental Terminals Company encourages associates to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of associate participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Associates have access to all information generated from HAZOPs and Site Risk Assessments.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives underway that address process safety and associate safety issues via the ACT Safety Committee which is comprised of site personnel and selected contractors.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The ACT Terminal Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help associates locate any necessary process safety information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified operating envelopes, i.e., documented safety related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  "

      "SummaryText": "The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as form evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.
