This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety and environmental consequences in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant, located in Geismar, Louisiana, operates a cracking and fractionation process to produce ethylene, propylene, crude butadiene and debutanized aromatic concentrate from ethane and propane feedstocks. The Geismar Ethylene Plant is subject to the requirements of  40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant has regulated flammable substances including, propane, 1,3-butadiene, propylene, ethylene and ethane.  Additionally, the plant uses chlorine, which is also a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe coordinates of the Geismar Ethylene Plant is, 30o, 14', 09\" N Latitude and 91 o, 03', 02\" Longitude measured at the center of the facility. \n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nToxic Materials.  The worst-case scenario associated with a toxic material involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute period.  Under worst-case conditions, chlorine could travel up to 4.5 miles as estimated by EPA's OCA Guidance (Table 7), with an endpoint concentration of 3.0-ppm (ERPG-2).  No administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were considered in evaluating this s"

      "SummaryText": "cenario. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for a toxic material at the Geismar Ethylene Plant involves the release of 216 pounds of chlorine over a 30 minute period due to the mechanical shear of a <\" chlorine cylinder vapor valve.  Under alternative release conditions, chlorine could travel up to 0.4 miles as estimated by SaferTrace, with an endpoint concentration of 3.0-ppm (ERPG-2).\n\nFlammable Materials.  The worst-case scenario associated with the release of a flammable material at the plant involves the release of 1,524,500 pounds of 1,3-butadiene over a 10-minute period. Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a distance up to 0.92 miles as estimated by EPA TNT Equivalency Model, Eq. C-1.  No administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for a flammable material at the plant involves the release of 13,800 pounds of crude butadiene over a 10-minute period due to the mechanical shear of a 2\" line downstream of the emergency shutdown (ESD) valve at the storage sphere.  Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a distance up to 0.05 miles as estimated by the Baker-Strehlow model. \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Every incident is investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent the incident or similar incidents from recurring.  Table 1 below is a summary of the RMP-reportable incidents that have occurred during the last 5 years.\n \nTable 1.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Geismar Ethylene Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level; composition) in the operating procedures.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, health, safety and environmental experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary or the probability and severity of an incident produce an unacceptable risk.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential incident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Geismar Ethylene Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them on a continual basis to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Geismar Ethylene Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Geismar Ethylene Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in plant operations.  All new employees receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an area-qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they are qualified for that area and are allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant uses contractors for normal maintenance as well as to supplement its workforce during pe"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Geismar Ethylene Plant periodically monitors contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety program and performance obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information that exceeds $50,000 or otherwise deemed necessary by local management.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  In addition to Management of Change, the PSSR provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all  supporting systems are operationally ready. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant has well-established mechanical integrity practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating  condition.
