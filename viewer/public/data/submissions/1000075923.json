The amount of anhydrous ammonia at  the  stationary  source  requires  development  and  submittal  of  a  RMP  Program  Level  3  to  the  local Administering Agency, Kern County Department of Environmental Health.\r\n\r\nCertis has prepared this Risk Management Plan to prevent accidental releases and plan for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia used in the process at the Certis Wasco facility.\r\n\r\nCertis has developed maintenance,  inspection and  training programs for employees and contractors to prevent  releases.    Certis  has  also  developed  an  Emergency  Response  Manual,  and  has  listed  the hazardous materials at the site including anhydrous ammonia in the Hazardous Materials Business Plan.\r\n\r\nThe  Certis  Wasco  facility  is  located  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Region  V  local  emergency  planning committee (LEPC).  Region V includes the counties of Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, and Tulare, with headquarters in Fresno.  A community emergency response plan has been prepared by the  Region  V  LEPC,  which  is  titled  the  Region  V  Hazardous  Materials  Response  Plan.    This  plan  is intended to meet the requirements of \u00a7 11003 of Title 42 of the USC.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental chemical releases as the Certis facility within the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe Certis emergency response program includes names and contact information for various emergency scenarios, chain-of-command structure, instructions for emergency situations.  Most Certis employees are trained  in  basic  first  aid  and  some  are  CPR  trained.    All  Certis  personnel  are  trained  in  the  use  of emergency air breathing systems and how to warn others in the area where there has been a hazardous gas release.\r\n\r\nAll  employees  at  the  Wasco  Plan"
