              "Description": "Similar to strong nitric acid, the previous RMP revisions addressed oleum as two separate discrete storage processes located at the Acid Area and the Nitrocellulose Area. The process description in this RMP has been revised to address this as a single RMP-covered process consisting of interconnected piping and vessels.  \n\n\n\nThis process consists of the oleum contained in the storage tanks at the Acid Area tank farm, the 0.5 miles of transfer piping between the Acid Area and the Nitrocellulose Area, the contents of A-and B-Tanks and piping at the Nitrocellulose Area tank farm, and the 600 ft of transfer piping to the scale house. Within the Acid Area, oleum can be stored in two tanks each with a height of 20 ft and a diameter of 21 ft, for a potential maximum per-tank volume of 51,800 gallons. The transfer pipe between the oleum tanks at the Acid Area and the tanks in the Nitrocellulose Area Tank Farm is considered to be 6? in diameter (i.e., leaving the Acid Area as 3? and entering the Nitrocellulose Area as 6?) and 0.5 mile in length. Oleum is predominantly stored only at A-Tank in the Nitrocellulose Area; however, the interconnected piping exists to be able to fill B-Tank with oleum, and so these volumes were considered as well. Under typical operation, B-Tank is used for storage of 93% sulfuric acid. Finally, the oleum is transferred through a 4? pipe to the Scale House for mixing and subsequent use.\n\n\n\nAll tankage associated with this process are located within concrete secondary containment dikes with acid-resistant lining.  The maximum quantity of oleum that may be present in this process at a point in time is 2,305,163 lbs. These quantities were validated through calculations provided by area process engineers.",

              "Description": "In previous RMP revisions, strong nitric acid (>98.5% concentration) was addressed as two separate discrete storage processes located at the Acid Area and the Nitrocellulose Area. The process description in this 2015 RMP has been revised to address this as a single RMP-covered process consisting of interconnected piping and vessels.  This process consists of the strong nitric acid contained in the Nitric Acid Concentrator/Sulfuric Acid Concentrator (NAC/SAC) post-condenser, 500 ft of transfer lines between the NAC/SAC and the strong nitric acid tank farm at the Acid Area, the 0.5 miles of transfer piping between the Acid Area and the Nitrocellulose Area, the contents of I-Tank at the Nitrocellulose Area tank farm, and the 600 ft of transfer piping to the scale house. \n\n\n\nThe starting of this process is the point at which the strong nitric acid after the condenser at the NAC/SAC is considered to be above the 80% concentration threshold established in 40 CFR Part ?68.130. Within the Acid Area, strong nitric acid can be stored in up to six tanks each with a height of 20 ft and a diameter of 21 ft, for a potential maximum per-tank volume of 51,800 gallons. The transfer pipe between the tanks at the Acid Area and the tanks in the Nitrocellulose Area is 3? in diameter and 0.5 mile in length. Strong nitric acid is stored only in I-tank at the Nitrocellulose Tank Farm, which is a horizontal tank 8 ft in diameter and 30 ft in length; the previous tank in this location was 9?x36? in size. Finally, the strong nitric acid is transferred through a 6? pipe to the Scale House for mixing and subsequent use. The Scale House is considered the endpoint at which the concentration of nitric acid is below 80% concentration. \n\n\n\nAll tankage associated with this process are located within concrete secondary containment dikes with acid-resistant lining. The maximum quantity of strong nitric acid that may be present in this process at a point in time is 4,102,338 lbs. These quantities were validated through calculations provided by area process engineers. Pyro/spent acid tanks are not included in this process because the nitric strength is not high enough to exceed the RMP threshold for nitric acid (i.e., >80%). ",

              "Description": "Previously, anhydrous ammonia stored at the Acid Area was predominantly utilized by the Ammonia Oxidation Plant (AOP) to produce weak nitric acid. A smaller quantity of this stored ammonia was transferred through a 0.5 mile 1?-diameter piping run to the Nitrocellulose Area to support the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Air Pollution Control Device for NOx control. The AOP has been non-operational since 2012, and a return to service is not anticipated in the near term. Therefore, the only current use of anhydrous ammonia is for the SCR. \n\n\n\nAlthough the Acid Area has five ammonia storage tanks, administrative controls are in place to limit the maximum amount to one tank controlled at an 85% fill level, or a maximum mass of 170,000 lbs. The amount calculated to be present in associated piping between the tank and the SCR in the Nitrocellulose Area is considered to be negligible (i.e., <1 lbs), as demonstrated through engineering calculations. The ammonia storage tanks at the Acid Area are located within a concrete secondary containment area. One of the empty ammonia tanks is maintained under vacuum as a safety precaution so that the content of the filled ammonia tank can be evacuated in the event of a leak. Additionally, the ammonia storage area has an Ammonia Detection System and an Ammonia Halo Fog Spray (i.e., water curtain) system that will automatically activate upon detection of a leak. ",

              "Description": "Oleum and strong nitric acid used in the manufacturing of nitrocellulose are delivered by railcars which are unloaded at the Acid Area and pumped to the storage tanks (see Processes in this RMP for nitric acid and oleum storage/transfer). Occasionally, railcars may need to be retained on plant prior to unloading at the Acid Area.  Ammonia is not considered in transient railcar storage because it is now only received via tanker truck, with no potential for transient on-site storage.\n\n\n\nA worst-case transient railcar storage scenario was considered with a maximum of four railcars of oleum (each containing 189,000 lbs, for a total of 756,000 lbs) and two railcars of strong nitric acid (each containing 185,000 lbs, for a total of 370,000 lbs). These quantities were arrived at through interviews with area personnel knowledgeable about maximum contemporaneous inventory. Prior to unloading at the Acid Area, these railcars would be potentially stored at the rail siding along the river warehouse. However, the railcars may also be stored at the Acid Area rail siding adjacent to the Powerhouse for a period of time prior to being moved again to the tank farm for final unloading. ",

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP) is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located in Radford, Virginia. RFAAP is owned by the U.S. Department of the Army, and is currently operated under contract by BAE Systems, Ordnance Systems Inc. effective 1 July 2012. RFAAP has been in continuous operation since 1941. RFAAP maintains an accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, management of change, and employee training associated with the facility's processes. RFAAP maintains 24/7 on-site security and fire services, and coordinates with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee to provide additional emergency response expertise if needed.\n\nRegulated Substances at RFAAP\n\n\n\nThe primary operations at RFAAP are propellant manufacturing processes for both military and commercial purposes. The RFAAP primary activity is described as Explosives Manufacturing (NAICS Code 32592). As the Ammonia Oxidation Process (AOP) is not active at the current time, none of RFAAP's processes are considered to be listed under NAICs Code for Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing (325188). In support of these operations, RFAAP maintains more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances:  nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), ethyl ether (60-29-7), ammonia (7664-41-7) and oleum (8014-95-7). Therefore, RFAAP is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nRMP Covered Processes at RFAAP\n\n\n\nThe 2015 RMP revision is the first five-year major update since BAE Systems, OSI became the operating contractor of RFAAP.  As such, the approach that was taken during this update cycle was to perform a full revalidation of all processes at RFAAP, resulting in a redefinition of many of the covered processes previously described in the facility's RMP. \n\n \n\nThe RMP covered processes at RFAAP as of the October 2015 update are summ"

The updated RMP document summarizes and evaluates all release events associated with each covered process, regardless of severity (i.e., inclusive of minor leaks contained entirely within secondary containment and with no personnel exposure). \n\nOne accidental release event was identified which is required to be included in the five-year accident history for the oleum process. A spill occurred on 1 July 2012 resulting in a release of 137,000 lbs of oleum; a tank failed due to water infiltration via a fume-line, resulting in an exothermic reaction in the tank and its eventual catastrophic failure. On-site consequences consisted of property damage to several adjacent tanks at the tank farm and its associated secondary containment dike, as well as requiring railroad track repairs and soil remediation. Personnel injury requiring treatment other than first aid also occurred to employees responding to the spill. Offsite impacts were limited to a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) water permit deviation for pH at a monitored outfall; however, no damage to receptors occurred as a result (i.e., fish kills or vegetation impacts).\n\nOff-Site Consequences Analysis - Worst Case\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Off-Site Consequences Analysis were developed.  Per EPA's guidance, the intention of these scenarios is to provide a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions.

RFAAP followed EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance in developing the Worst-Case release scenarios, and verified the results via RMP*Comp against the results obtained from the Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  As required by the guidance, the worst-case release scenarios were modeled using the worst meteorological conditions, which are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F. The temperature of released substance was considered to be the highest daily maximum temperature for the three year look-back period was 95 degrees F which was measured on 30 June 2012. The following paragraphs describe the results of the modeling for the worst-case scenario.\n\nWorst Case for Ether Processes: The worst-case release scenario associated with the ethyl ether process group was modeled as a vapor cloud explosion from one of the ether bulk storage tanks containing 296,662 lbs, which is the largest individual vessel in the process. As this is a flammable substance, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud detonation.

The release rate is based on the rate of evaporation from the resulting pool within the dike. The worst case release modeling indicated an endpoint distance of 2.5 miles and impacts to a population of 2,339.

The endpoint distance of 3.6 miles calculated for the 2015 RMP is substantively higher than described in previous RMP versions (0.6 miles) due to the application of temperature correction factors for the spilled liquid as required by the guidance. Therefore, this process qualifies as a Program 3.\n\n\n\nWorst Case for Nitric Acid and Oleum Transient Railcar Storage: The worst-case release scenario associated with nitic acid and oleum in transient railcar storage and piping assumes that the volume of the an entire tanker car (189,000 lbs oleum, 185,000 lbs nitric acid) is instantaneously lost to ground and a uniform pool of one centimeter depth is immediately formed. This is the required assumption for the worst-case modeling for this scenario, as the tanker cars are not stored within a secondary containment or impoundment. It is for this reason that although the total volume of the release is larger for the bulk storage tanks of nitric acid and oleum, the endpoint distances are larger for a railcar release since the surface area of the pool is not constrained by a dike.  For a strong nitric acid railcar, the worst case release modeling indicated an endpoint distance of 16.0 miles and impacts to a population of 140,714.  An oleum railcar worst case release would result in an endpoint distance of 12.0 mils and impacts to a population of 78,660.

Therefore, development of the overall quantity as derived from the release rate and duration of release are dependent on the specifics of the alternative release scenario selected. Each individual alternative release scenario was evaluated to determine what level of mitigation is considered credible and appropriate based on the specifics of the each scenario. RFAAP considered multiple potential scenarios for each regulated substance, and subjected them to sensitivity analysis for emergency response planning purposes.  To facilitate this exercise, RFAAP utilized RMP*Comp for the modeling, in consultation with the guidance presented in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis. All modeling was performed under meteorological conditions considering a wind speed of 3 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of D. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario developed for ammonia assumes that a hole has developed in the liquid space of a storage tank at the Acid Area, via either flange failure or pipe shearing at the 18\" line at the bottom of the tank. Additionally, pipe or flange failure was considered appropriate for this analysis due to being more credible for use in disaster planning purposes for the facility and less duplicative than modeling a tank failure which was already considered under the worst-case analysis. Administrative controls prevent filling of the ammonia tanks to greater than 50% of capacity, which is equivalent to a liquid height of approximately 65 inches above the flange location, based on the strapping table for this tank.

The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for ammonia indicated an endpoint distance of 1.2 miles based on RMP*Comp. The size of the population impacted by this release is estimated at 2,619, and potential public receptors include residential areas and recreational areas (New River).

This is consistent with 40 CFR 68.28(e) which requires that facilities consider their five-year accident histories and previous incidents as documented in the Process Hazards Analyses for their covered processes when selecting an alternate release scenario.

The scenario involved the complete failure of the line due to either shearing (e.g., external impact) or flange failure.  The release was considered as unmitigated due to the lack of a secondary containment dike at the location where the failure was assumed to occur, such as one of the open fields that this line crosses. The typical operational flowrate of this line during transfer is approximately 100 gallons/min; a range of volume loss was explored in the sensitivity analysis as described in the following section, and was selected at 80% for the purpose of modeling. This is considered plausible as a result of either flange leak or damage to the pipe support. Acid transfers occur at night, the remote areas where the transfer line crosses are unattended, and a partial loss of the transfer volume would not be likely observed by the operators until the transfer was complete. Therefore, release durations ranging up to 60 minutes were considered via sensitivity analysis, which is the average time-to-completion for a nitric acid transfer between the Nitrocellulose and Acid Areas; an event duration of 45 minutes was selected for this scenario.

All covered process PHAs were initiated within 5-years of the previous 2010 PHAs, but the final report dates were not available at time of RMP submittal to EPA in October 2015.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: All operating procedures are available to all employees through the Document Control System, and the operators are routinely retrained on these procedures. Consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Part ??68.69(a)(1), the process operating procedures contain steps for each operating phase, inclusive of initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdow"

RFAAP's operating procedures also include information on the operating limits of each process, inclusive of the consequences of deviation from these limits and the steps required to correct or avoid deviation. Procedures are subjected to a regular review and recertification to assure that the contained information is correct and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nTraining: RFAAP has a dedicated Training Department which holds the primary responsibility for conducting personnel training and also serves as the central repository for the maintenance of training records for all plant personnel. Each employee involved in the operation of any process at RFAAP is trained on the applicable Operating Procedures. All training includes emphasis of the specific safety and health hazards associated with the equipment and chemicals involved, as well as emergency operation and safe work practices. Initial training for each operator consists of reading the procedure, and being instructed firsthand on process operations via a walkthrough with the procedure in-hand. Upon any procedure change, each operator is retrained using the same methods as for initial training. The Training Department maintains a database of each employee's required training, including the date of the initial training, the date of the most recent training, and the date that the next refresher training is required.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: RFAAP has established written procedures to ensure the ongoing integrity of process equipment and that employees are trained in conducing these maintenance activities. Additionally, the facility has an overarching Maintenance Plan which documents the Preventative Maintenance and Inspection System. The aspects of this plan satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR ??68.73 for addressing the ongoing mechanical integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and device"

The centralized planning and tracking system of the Preventative Maintenance (PM) system at RFAAP is Maximo, which is an asset management software platform used to track the frequency of PMs and the date that the PM is closed. In the event that a defect is observed during a PM and additional work is required, the defect is noted on the work order, the original PM is closed, and a \"PM Defect\" work order is issued to track the corrective action to completion.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: The Plant Process Control Board (PPCB) is the core of the overall Management of Change framework at RFAAP, and governs both process and non-process changes, ensuring that the applicable requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA 40 CFR Part 68, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 14001, and Occupational Health & Safety Advisory Services (OHSAS) 18001 are met. RFAAP's Document Control System is the central repository of all written operating procedures, forms, and all other applicable controlled documents. This is a computer-based Management of Change (MOC) system that can be accessed through any plant computer with network access. In addition to providing a centralized source for accessing the current operating procedures and associated controlled documents, this system also tracks the review and approval process for the appropriate personnel prior to procedure change implementation.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews: The Plant Process Control Board conducts pre-start up reviews before a process is allowed to operate. Prior to start-up of a process, a Production Readiness Review Checklist must be completed and reviewed. A minimum of five (5) management-level representatives such as from Safety, Environmental and Operations must be present at the pre-startup evaluation and must concur with the decision to start and provide their signature of approval. The associated checklist ensures that procedures are in place and adequat"

Per this written procedure, the \"investigation team must be formed and the investigation started as soon as possible based on the class of the incident and the conditions surrounding the incident and affected area.\" RFAAP's Management Manual 3-1.01 - Environmental Quality and Safety Incident Reporting additionally describes the process for incidents that are classified as environmental in nature and do not necessarily trigger the Safety incident requirements. All spills at RFAAP are required to be reported and investigated as Environmental events, even if the event is a nominal release entirely contained within secondary containment and without resulting in any health or safety impacts. Investigation of even minor events and near-misses is considered a means of identifying and addressing potential issues, and thereby preventing more significant events. The incident investigation report is reviewed with all affected personnel and all incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: The Employee Safety Committee is established at RFAAP to promote safety compliance at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant. Through this forum, employees are able to meet monthly to identify and discuss safety and health issues and propose recommendations to the management team. Employee involvement in incident investigations and Process Hazard Analyses is also required at RFAAP. Per Plant Protection Standard 1.77 - Safety Incident Reporting and Investigation Requirements, all incident investigation teams are required to include employees representing Op"

Representatives from Safety, at a minimum, attend a Pre-Work meeting to ensure that this information is clearly communicated. The booklet includes information ranging from general safety procedures, such as ladder use and hot work, as well as facility-specific hazards.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: RFAAP Environmental is responsible for initiating, conducting, and documenting the RMP Compliance Audits on a minimum of a 3-year cycle. Any identified deficiencies are documented in the associated report, and tracking-to-resolution of proposed corrective action will be documented through RFAAP's Environmental Event Report (EER) system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nRFAAP has several plans and procedures which satisfy the emergency response requirements of 40 CFR Part ??68.95 and were developed to be protective of human health and the environment. The Disaster Control Plan describes procedures, event communication and personnel responsibilities in the event of a disaster, as RFAAP recognizes that the potential for a chemical release exists as secondary to a causative external event, such as a natural event or act of terrorism. RFAAP also maintains a RFAAP Fire Prevention Plan and Hazardous Material Response Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nSeveral projects are in progress at RFAAP to improve safety in the RMP covered processes.
