RFAAP is owned by the U.S. Department of the Army, and is currently operated under contract by BAE Systems, Ordnance Systems Inc. effective 1 July 2012. RFAAP has been in continuous operation since 1941. RFAAP maintains an accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, management of change, and employee training associated with the facility's processes. RFAAP maintains 24/7 on-site security and fire services, and coordinates with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee to provide additional emergency response expertise if needed.\r\nRegulated Substances at RFAAP\r\n\r\nThe primary operations at RFAAP are propellant manufacturing processes for both military and commercial purposes. The RFAAP primary activity is described as Explosives Manufacturing (NAICS Code 32592). As the Ammonia Oxidation Process (AOP) is not active at the current time, none of RFAAP's processes are considered to be listed under NAICs Code for Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing (325188). In support of these operations, RFAAP maintains more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances:  nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), ethyl ether (60-29-7), ammonia (7664-41-7) and oleum (8014-95-7). Therefore, RFAAP is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68).\r\nRMP Covered Processes at RFAAP\r\n\r\nThe 2015 RMP revision is the first five-year major update since BAE Systems, OSI became the operating contractor of RFAAP.  As such, the approach that was taken during this update cycle was to perform a full revalidation of all processes at RFAAP, resulting in a redefinition of many of the covered processes previously described in the facility's RMP. \r\n \r\nThe RMP covered processes at RFAAP as of the October 2015 update are summ"

A spill occurred on 1 July 2012 resulting in a release of 137,000 lbs of oleum; a tank failed due to water infiltration via a fume-line, resulting in an exothermic reaction in the tank and its eventual catastrophic failure. On-site consequences consisted of property damage to several adjacent tanks at the tank farm and its associated secondary containment dike, as well as requiring railroad track repairs and soil remediation. Personnel injury requiring treatment other than first aid also occurred to employees responding to the spill.

RFAAP followed EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance in developing the Worst-Case release scenarios, and verified the results via RMP*Comp against the results obtained from the Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  As required by the guidance, the worst-case release scenarios were modeled using the worst meteorological conditions, which are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F. The temperature of released substance was considered to be the highest daily maximum temperature for the three year look-back period was 95 degrees F which was measured on 30 June 2012. The following paragraphs describe the results of the modeling for the worst-case scenario.\r\nWorst Case for Ether Processes: The worst-case release scenario associated with the ethyl ether process group was modeled as a vapor cloud explosion from one of the ether bulk storage tanks containing 296,662 lbs, which is the largest individual vessel in the process. As this is a flammable substance, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud detonation.

The release rate is based on the rate of evaporation from the resulting pool within the dike.

The endpoint distance of 3.6 miles calculated for the 2015 RMP is substantively higher than described in previous RMP versions (0.6 miles) due to the application of temperature correction factors for the spilled liquid as required by the guidance. Therefore, this process qualifies as a Program 3.\r\n\r\nWorst Case for Nitric Acid and Oleum Transient Railcar Storage: The worst-case release scenario associated with nitic acid and oleum in transient railcar storage and piping assumes that the volume of the an entire tanker car (189,000 lbs oleum, 185,000 lbs nitric acid) is instantaneously lost to ground and a uniform pool of one centimeter depth is immediately formed. This is the required assumption for the worst-case modeling for this scenario, as the tanker cars are not stored within a secondary containment or impoundment. It is for this reason that although the total volume of the release is larger for the bulk storage tanks of nitric acid and oleum, the endpoint distances are larger for a railcar release since the surface area of the pool is not constrained by a dike.  For a strong nitric acid railcar, the worst case release modeling indicated an endpoint distance of 16.0 miles and impacts to a population of 140,714.  An oleum railcar worst case release would result in an endpoint distance of 12.0 mils and impacts to a population of 78,660.

Therefore, development of the overall quantity as derived from the release rate and duration of release are dependent on the specifics of the alternative release scenario selected. Each individual alternative release scenario was evaluated to determine what level of mitigation is considered credible and appropriate based on the specifics of the each scenario. RFAAP considered multiple potential scenarios for each regulated substance, and subjected them to sensitivity analysis for emergency response planning purposes.  To facilitate this exercise, RFAAP utilized RMP*Comp for the modeling, in consultation with the guidance presented in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis. All modeling was performed under meteorological conditions considering a wind speed of 3 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of D. \r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario developed for ammonia assumes that a hole has developed in the liquid space of a storage tank at the Acid Area, via either flange failure or pipe shearing at the 18\" line at the bottom of the tank. Additionally, pipe or flange failure was considered appropriate for this analysis due to being more credible for use in disaster planning purposes for the facility and less duplicative than modeling a tank failure which was already considered under the worst-case analysis. Administrative controls prevent filling of the ammonia tanks to greater than 50% of capacity, which is equivalent to a liquid height of approximately 65 inches above the flange location, based on the strapping table for this tank.

Only active mitigation is considered for this scenario based on the activation of the Halo water curtain system within the tank location. An effectiveness of 50% for the Halo system was assumed. Even though this tank is located with secondary containment, credit is not taken for passive mitigation in this scenario due to the assumption that the dike would be overfilled with the deluge water. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for ammonia indicated an endpoint distance of 1.2 miles based on RMP*Comp. The size of the population impacted by this release is estimated at 2,619, and potential public receptors include residential areas and recreational areas (New River). No environmental receptors are associated with this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario developed for oleum was based upon the characteristics of the 1 July 2012 spill that was included in the process's 5-year accident history. This is consistent with 40 CFR 68.28(e) which requires that facilities consider their five-year accident histories and previous incidents as documented in the Process Hazards Analyses for their covered processes when selecting an alternate release scenario.

The size of the hole was considered as 2 sq in, which is consistent with personnel reports at the time that the leak was discovered.

The Jefferson National Forest was identified as a potential environmental receptor for this release.\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario developed for nitric acid assumes that a failure occurs at the 3\" transfer line between the Acid and the Nitrocellulose Areas. The scenario involved the complete failure of the line due to either shearing (e.g., external impact) or flange failure.  The release was considered as unmitigated due to the lack of a secondary containment dike at the location where the failure was assumed to occur, such as one of the open fields that this line crosses. The typical operational flowrate of this line during transfer is approximately 100 gallons/min; a range of volume loss was explored in the sensitivity analysis as described in the following section, and was selected at 80% for the purpose of modeling. This is considered plausible as a result of either flange leak or damage to the pipe support. Acid transfers occur at night, the remote areas where the transfer line crosses are unattended, and a partial loss of the transfer volume would not be likely observed by the operators until the transfer was complete. Therefore, release durations ranging up to 60 minutes were considered via sensitivity analysis, which is the average time-to-completion for a nitric acid transfer between the Nitrocellulose and Acid Areas; an event duration of 45 minutes was selected for this scenario.

Plant Protection Standard 1.05 - Process Hazard Analysis describes RFAAP's requirements for employee participation, as representatives from multiple functional areas are required to be on the team.\r\n\r\nContractors: All contractors, subcontractors and tenants at RFAAP are required to read and certify by signature that they understand and will abide by the rules identified in the General Plant Rules for Contractors, Subcontractors, Tenants and Government Employees. Representatives from Safety, at a minimum, attend a Pre-Work meeting to ensure that this information is clearly communicated. The booklet includes information ranging from general safety procedures, such as ladder use and hot work, as well as facility-specific hazards.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: RFAAP Environmental is responsible for initiating, conducting, and documenting the RMP Compliance Audits on a minimum of a 3-year cycle. Any identified deficiencies are documented in the associated report, and tracking-to-resolution of proposed corrective action will be documented through RFAAP's Environmental Event Report (EER) system.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nRFAAP has several plans and procedures which satisfy the emergency response requirements of 40 CFR Part ?\u00bf68.95 and were developed to be protective of human health and the environment. The Disaster Control Plan describes procedures, event communication and personnel responsibilities in the event of a disaster, as RFAAP recognizes that the potential for a chemical release exists as secondary to a causative external event, such as a natural event or act of terrorism. RFAAP also maintains a RFAAP Fire Prevention Plan and Hazardous Material Response Plan.\r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Improvements\r\n\r\nSeveral projects are in progress at RFAAP to improve safety in the RMP covered processes. A construction project to replace the legacy Solvent Recovery stills is ongoing with completion expected in 2016, and this"

      "SummaryText": "modernized facility will improve the safety of personnel working with ethyl ether in this plant area. A multi-year project to refurbish and improve the Acid Area Tank Farm, inclusive of strong nitric acid and oleum storage, is in progress and will involve improvements/replacements to the legacy tankage as well as to the secondary containment dikes. As described in this RMP, a project is underway to evaluate and design a satellite ammonia tank to be potentially sited at the SCR, which is the only current ammonia user on plant at this point in time; use of a smaller tank would mitigate risk of release."
