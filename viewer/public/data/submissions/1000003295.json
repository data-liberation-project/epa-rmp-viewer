Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Sour Lake Olefins Facility (SLOF) is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  The SLOF implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the processes at the facility, and assures that the facility has a well-trained work force.  The program further implements these policies through onsite procedures and manuals, and conforms to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) requirements.  SLOF participates with the Hardin County Emergency Management Office, County Sheriff's Office, Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department, and other agencies to develop emergency response plans and participate in cooperative training drills.  The Operations Manager is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP) at the SLOF.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances. The Sour Lake Olefins Facility (SLOF) is located in Sour Lake, Texas, just off of Stonewall Road.  The site stores ethylene, an olefin.  This product is stored in underground salt dome caverns and processed to remove water associated with storage.\n\nThe flammable regulated substance is ethylene, used by other facilities to manufacture polyethylene grocery bags, wraps and machine parts, and as a raw material for other ethylene based products (ethylene glycol-antifreeze, ethanol amines-shaving creams, hand lotions, furniture polishes, and dry-cleaning preparations, etc.).\n\n3.  Prevention Program\n\nSLOF is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety help minimize the potential for chemical release accidents.  Part of this program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potent"

A few examples of the prevention measures in place at this facility include:\n\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tContinuous pilots on the flare to ensure combustion of ethylene vapors, with a pilot monitoring system with an alarm to signal if the pilot goes out\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tGas detectors in the process area and at the caverns for early detection of a release\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tEmergency Shutdown Devices (ESDs) on the well heads and in the process area to stop the flow of ethylene, brine, and fresh water\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tExcess flow devices to sense abnormal flow and automatically activate the ESDs\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tIndicators for level, flow, and pressure on the caverns and process area to prevent overfilling/overpressurization\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tEmergency backup generator, air compressor, and water pumps to minimize the potential for loss of controls due to a utilities outage\nA\u00c2\u00b7\tManning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all operations\n\n\n4.  5 Year Accident History. SLOF has had no releases in the last five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  SLOF has written emergency response programs that contain procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  These procedures include steps for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases, documentation of proper first aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training for emergency response employees who perform emergency response duties.  The emergency response plans are reviewed annually as well as in the event of changes at the facility that could affect emergency response, and are updated as necessary.  SLOF is actively involved with informing local stakeholders about hazardous substances stored and processed on site.  SLO"
