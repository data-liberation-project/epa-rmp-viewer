The ammonia storage vessel temperature is monitored through a local indicator.  The liquid level in the vessel is monitored through a local gauge as well as an electronic telemetry unit.  An alert system including an audible alarm is installed for leak detection and out-of-tolerance pressure conditions.  The ammonia tank pressure is indicated through a local gauge.  The tank is equipped with two (2) sets of dual pressure relief valves set at 250 psig atop 3-way valves; excess flow valves at all fluid flow nozzles; and thermal relief valves set at 350 psig on associated liquid ammonia lines.\n\nAmmonia  Dissociators\n\nAnhydrous ammonia vapor is piped from the top of the storage tank at 125 psig and is reduced to 40 psig to provide constant pressure feed to the dissociator vessels.  At each of the three (3) dissociator vessels the NH3 vapor is again reduced to 12 psig for introduction into the pre-heater.  NH3 vapor is then piped into the catalyst chamber and heated to approximately 1750\u00b0F.  The dissociated ammonia gas (DA) is then piped into the plant for use in the kilns and furnaces as process gas. Atop each dissociator vessel piping is a Kunkle pressure relief valve set at 15 psig.\n\n\nAdTech Ceramics has diligently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics-Chattanooga, TN\n\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics Company (AdTech Ceramics) is an ISO9001:2015 and AS9100D manufacturer of multilayer co-fired ceramics electronic packages.  Processes revolve around 50 plus years of experience in material science, engineering, design, tooling and manufacturing of multilayer ceramics.  AdTech Ceramics provides High Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (HTCC), Ceramic Feedthroughs, Multi Layer Aluminum Nitride (AlN), Chemical Metal Milling, and Injection Molded Ceramics to the military, aerospace, medical, energy, and other high reliability applications industries.\n\nSystem Overview\n\nAdTech Ceramics has a process by which anhydrous ammonia is dissociated, or broken down, into its elemental components, nitrogen and hydrogen.  Saturated anhydrous ammonia vapor is piped to dissociator units that heat the ammonia vapor to 1750\u00b0F, thereby facilitating separation of the NH3 molecule into its component parts, nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases.  This dissociated ammonia (DA) gas is used as process gas for firing kilns and furnaces in a controlled reducing atmosphere free of oxidation.  Anhydrous ammonia is supplied by tanker truck through a liquid filled connection.   Emergency shut-off valves are provided at both the liquid fill and vapor return lines to allow quick shut-off of liquid and vapor flow in the event of an accidental pull-away of a truck or hose rupture.  Ammonia is stored in a liquid state in equilibrium with its vapor at saturation conditions in a pressurized vessel.  The vessel is maintained at approximately 125 psig by an electric vaporizer controlled by pressure switches modulating the heat input to the ammonia vaporizer.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage Vessel\n\nAmmonia storage includes a 12,000-gallon stationary, horizontal, cylindrical pressure vessel for storing liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  The storage vessel is sized to provide approximately 90 days of continuous supply of dissociated amm"
