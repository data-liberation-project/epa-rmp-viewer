      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\n\nBackground Data\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Federal Environmental Administration (EPA), Precision Terminal Logistics  has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations involving Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) at their Louisville, KY, LA facility.  The PTL terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The Louisville, KY terminal has been in operation since 2020.  The terminal is located at 595 N. 34th Street, Louisville, KY.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nPTL is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is PTL policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nPTL will handle liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) products at this terminal, transloading product from railroad tank cars into highway cargo trailers and vise versa in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for LPG products using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The PTL worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, PTL has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\nAlternativ"

      "SummaryText": "e Release Scenario\n\nPTL also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level probability of occurrence (although a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 100,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios,  PTL has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by PTL is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, PTL considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA\u0092s RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of LPG products, PTL has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n\u0095\tDeveloped standard operating procedures (SOP\u0092S) for the Transloading of LPG products from railcar to highway cargo tank and cargo tank to railcar for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n\u0095\tPTL encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.  Employees are expected to follow established procedures until employee driven process changes are implemented, training conducted and communicated to all affected persons.\n\u0095\tPTL conducts operational audits and inspections to insure compliance with established operating procedures, maintenance of transfer equipment and facility physical"

These processes include preventative maintenance of the transfer unit to maintain on-board safety and control systems.\n\nThe transfer unit has been designed and constructed to meet or exceed the requirements outlined in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Code (2024 ed.).  A review of the National Fire Code finds this operation is in compliance with all requirements of the code.\n\nPTL will conduct initial familiarization sessions with the local emergency responders as part of the terminals emergency action plan (EAP).   In addition, the following agencies have compliance inspection authority over the PTL terminal on a regular basis:\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation - Federal Railroad Administration - Hazardous Materials Inspectors  \n\n\nFive- Year Accident History\n\nPTL has not handled LPG at this facility on a routine basis during the past five years.  There are no accidents or releases to report.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPTL and the site owner have documented emergency response plans and procedures in place at this facility to respond to and safely mitigate any release or accident involving LPG products.  Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by PTL operators to control the release, if possible, and to make initial notification to local responders and to PTL headquarters.\n\nOperator personnel at the terminal are trained to the Hazardous Materials Awareness level as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.  These employees may also perform activities under the specialist employee definition as defined by 1910.120.
