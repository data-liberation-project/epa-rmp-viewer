Post filtration chlorination and on site chlorine dioxide generation.  Both processes use liquid/gas chlorine in ton containers.  The purpose of this prevention program is to provide the information, training and experience needed to prevent any chlorine releases and to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the community.  This is accomplished by maintianing the most recent revisions of material safety data sheets, annual training and frequent reviews and updates of current procedures.",

The plant currently keeps an inventory of chlorine on site above the 2500 pound threshold hazardous level.\n\nThe owner and operator of the plant is Gulf Coast Water Authority, a public water authority created by the State of Texas to provide water to municipalities, industry, and agriculture.  Safety is a mission of all employees at Gulf Coast Water Authority.  It is company policy at Gulf Coast Water Authority to adhere to all applicable Federal and State safety regulations.  Gulf Coast Water Authority has taken precautions to ensure the safe storage and handling of chlorine to minimize the risks and hazards to employees and the surrounding community.\n\nCHLORINE:  Ton cylinders of chlorine gas are kept on site at the water treatment plant for use in two seperate processes.  Post filtration chlorination and chlorine dioxide generation are the two processes that require chlorine gas.  Up to 58,000 pounds of chlorine gas can be stored on the plant premises.\n\nPOST FILTRATION CHLORINATION:  This is the process where chlorine is added to the clarified and filtered water for disinfection.  The average feed rate for this process is approximately 1,200 pounds per day.  This system operates with 7 ton cylinders hooked up to a common header located in an enclosed and ventilated chlorine room.  A second header is on standby in the chlorine room with an additional 7 ton cylinders hooked up ready for automatic switch over when the on line header is expired.  Another 7 ton cylinders are kept in storage outside of the chlorine room to replace the cylinders on an expired header.  The total number of ton containers on site for this process is 21 (42,000 pounds).\n\nCHLORINE DIOXIDE GENERATION:  This is the process where chlorine gas is reacted with sodium chlorite to produce chlorine dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is a co-disinfectant used the enhance the"
