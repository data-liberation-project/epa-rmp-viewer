Shell Chemical Company is a signatory to Responsible Care., a Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) program committed to the continuous improvement of chemical safety management.  In accordance with Responsible Care., the Norco Chemical Plant maintains Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities.  As part of this commitment, NCP invests resources in various areas of accident prevention such as:\n\n- Safety in process design\n- Safe operating policies and procedures\n- A comprehensive mechanical integrity program\n- Management of process changes\n- Training\n- Incident investigation and auditing\n- Emergency response.\n \nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Norco Chemical Plant - St. Rose Site, including:\n\n- A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule.\n- A summary of potential release scenarios and potential off-site consequences.\n- An overview of the Accident Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n- An overview of the emergency response program\n- Existing and planned improvements to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe St. Rose Site produces quality olefins feedstocks from crude oil.  These feedstocks are used to manufacture ethylene and propylene at the Shell Norco Chemical Plant-East Site.  St. Rose consists of one  process which produces two (2) flammable feedstock products containing butane, ethane, methane, and propane in sufficient quantities to be covered under RMP. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite conseque"

      "SummaryText": "nce analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving flammable mixtures at the St. Rose Site.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions nor allow credit for all mitigations in-place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigations.  \n\nThe following are brief summaries of the Worst-Case and Alternative Release scenarios at St. Rose, including information on mitigation control measures to reduce potential offsite impact.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the ABS Group, Inc. RMPlanner 2.0 software tool.  This tool is based on the 1996 EPA OCA Guidance Tables.

Worst-Case Flammable Scenario - St. Rose Light Product\n\nThis scenario assumes the catastrophic failure, instantaneous release, and vapor cloud explosion of 2,600,000 lbs. of St. Rose Light Product from a liquid full storage tank.  The release calculation assumes an urban topography due to the number of co-located tanks and process area congestion between the tank and the nearest public receptor.  Although the tank is located within a 50,500 cubic foot containment dike, the modeling program did not give credit for the containment.  In addition, active (mechanical) mitigations can not be considered for worst-case scenarios under the RMP rule.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 1.10 miles (5,860 ft.).   A population estimate of 2,000 people offsite, including residential, religious, and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.

This scenario was selected due to a previous incident (see 5 year Accident History) involving a tank overfill and liquid pooling, but no fire.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the amount of process congestion in close proximity.  Passive mitigation consists of a 50,500 cubic foot containment dike.  Active mitigation consists of operator detection and intervention.  Operator response includes shutting down feed pumps to stop flow to the tank and activation of the area firewater monitors to disperse vapors from the liquid pool. Radio communication is used activate the Norco Emergency Response Team (ERT) who could respond in 15-20 minutes. Once on-site, the foam would be applied to extinguish the fire.  The maximum impact distance to a 5 kW/m2 for 40 sec (potential for 2nd degree burn) endpoint was calculated at 0.15 miles (770 ft.).  A population estimate of 60 people offsite, including residential and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.

Since the purchase of the St. Rose facility by Shell Chemical Company in 1996, there has been only one release incident involving an RMP regulated substance.  This involved the overfill and release of 75,000 lbs. of St. Rose Light Product from a storage tank during barge unloading operations.  The release was isolated and the product fully contained in the dike around the storage tank.  Area firewater monitors were used to suppress and dilute any vapor release until foam could be applied to the liquid pool in the dike.  There were no personnel injuries and no off-site protective measures were required.  This was considered an RMP reportable accident since the storage tank sustained structural damage from the incident.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Norco Chemical Plant is coordinated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP), MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC - Norco Refining Company and the St. Charles Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic committee meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, community members and industry representatives.  NCP and Norco Refining Company maintain trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents.
