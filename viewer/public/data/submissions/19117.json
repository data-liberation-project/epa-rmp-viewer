The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid].\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Hydrofluoric acid.  In this scenario 500 lb. of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) and enclosure(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F at"
