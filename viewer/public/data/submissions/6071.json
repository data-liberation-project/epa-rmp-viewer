FMC employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is a 12 acre complex bordered on 3 sides by houses and/or businesses.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed as a fertilizer to farmer customers.  The maximum quantity stored at any time is 228,956 lbs. or 44,200 gallons combined capacity of the two 26,000 gallon tanks.  The maximum capacity for one tank 184,535 lbs. or 22,100 gallons.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be to have all the amonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 0.90 miles from the tank.  Due to the location of the tanks in relation to the population of Star City there would be an impact on the surrounding area in case of a release.\n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 0.60 miles from the tank.  The alternative release scenario would have almost as much impact as the worst case scenario.\n\nFMC has instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist into our plan.\n\nWe have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is in place and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures.  All new hires will receive this training.  All emergency response agencies have received training in the hazards associated with responding to a release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIt is the policy of FMC to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release.  We will continue to cconduct audits and compliance inspections of equipment and procedures "
