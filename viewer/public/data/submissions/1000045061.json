The Facility Policy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Kova Ag Products at LaCrosse are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to area farmers.\r\n\r\n- Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance we handle that is contained in this Risk Management Plan.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area farmers for their use as a vital crop production nutrient (nitrogen).\r\n\r\n- The maximum amount stored of anhydrous ammonia at this facility would be 756,500 pounds in our one 12,000 gallon storage tank, two 18,000 gallon storage tanks, one 30,000 gallon storage tank and all nurse wagons.  Product is routinely loaded into 1,000 gallon and 1,500 gallon mobile nurse wagons for delivery and pick-up by and sold to area farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is rarely stored in the nurse wagons on the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis facility has instituted the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Trained and licensed anhydrous ammonia specialists conduct all construction and major system repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  The Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidental releases or injuries resulting from anhyd"
