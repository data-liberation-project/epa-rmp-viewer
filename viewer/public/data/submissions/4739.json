Defiance's accidental release prevention program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employeee participation, process safety and operating information, process hazard analysis and compliance auditing, pre-start up reveiws, mechanical integrity, management of chancge procedures, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and updating practices and procedures.  Applicable requirements for Program 3 Rrisk Management Programs are adhered to.  The emergency response program is tailored with respect to the available emergency responders and the Defiance County LEPC and includes notification procedures as well as plant evacuation procedures.\n\nThe chlorination system for the Defiance Water Pollution Control Plant is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge to the Maumee River.  The chlorination facilities include outdoor cylinder storage for one ton cylinders, a chlorine scale and feed room, various safety equipment and controls, two chlorinators, the necessary cylinder handling equipment, and a residual chlorine analyzer.  Normally chlorine is supplied from two one ton cylinders connected to the process feed piping.  The cylinders in service are controlled automatically using a switchover device that limits operation from a single cylinder.  Plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system at least once each shift and respond immediately to trouble or warning alarms.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios identified as the worst case scenario and the alternate release scanario.  Predictive release information was obtained using EPA's RMP*Comp model to identify the distance to endpoint for a potential chlorine release.  The worst case scenario involves a failure or rupture "

The distance to endpoint was estimated to be 1.3 miles from the chlorination facilities assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and atmospheric stability class F.  The endpoint determination assumes outdoor storage of the cylinder.  The potential population affected by the worst case scenario was estimated to be 770 persons.  The alternate release scenario involves a potential pipe leak where 1,845 pounds of chlorine gas may be released during a 15 minute accidental release.  The distance to endpoint was estimated to be 0.2 miles from the chlorination facilities assuming a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second and atmospheric stability class D.  The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the scale and feed room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 5 persons.\n\nActuation of the chlorine gas detectors was considered to be an active mitigation measure.   Additionally, the chlorine gas piping is vaccum tubing connected directly to the chlorine gas header.  A loss of vacuum in the tubing immediately stops the flow of chlorine gas from the header and reduces possibility of a chlorine release due to a piping leak.\n\nThe Defiance Water Pollution Control Plant Risk Management Program has the key elements listed below.  These elements are aimed at preventing a chlorine release from the chlorination system.\n   -high level of operator training and maintenance training,\n   -an established preventive maintenance program,\n   -implemetnation of an audit and inspection program,\n   -use of effective written operating procedures,\n   -implemetation of an employee participation program, \n   -use of emergency air supply and cylinder leak kits,\n   -performance of process hazard analysis and compliance auidting procedures,\n   -and the use of process alarms and emergency shut down procedures.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine gas"

The program includes plant evacuation procedures, emergency notification procedures for responders, and a notification plan.  Plant evacuation drills are performed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  Emergency response drills are performed inaccordance with LEPC schedules.\n\nNo recommendations for changes from the process hazard analysis and the compliance audit were identified from these activities.   A chlorine gas scrubber was recommended by a consultant to further reduce chlorine releases to the environment.  The scrubber is being considered by the City for future installation.\n\nThe dechlorination system for the Defiance Water Pollution Control Plant is used to dechlorinate wastewater using sulfur dioxide gas prior to discharge to the Maumee River.  The dechlorination facilities include outdoor cylinder storage for one ton cylinders, a sulfur dioxide scale and feed room, various safety equipment and controls, two sulfonators, the necessary cylinder handling equipment, and a residual chlorine analyzer.
