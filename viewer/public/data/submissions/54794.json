Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n     The management and employees of Madison Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Marine Fire Department, County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at Pocahontas Road, Marine, IL, is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 4-12,000 and 75-1,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 798,500 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 2"

The emergency response program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n-    a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n-    provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nIn the event of any emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Marine Fire Department and County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC."
