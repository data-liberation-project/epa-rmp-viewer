Facility Description and Regulated Substance\n\nMasterfoods USA, a division of Mars, Incorporated (hereinafter the Company), operates a production plant in Waco, Texas, at which confectionary products are manufactured.  The plant utilizes aqueous ammonia (concentration 29.4%) as a nitrogen source for its wastewater pretreatment system.  The system utilizes more than a threshold quantity of ammonia, as specified in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  \n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Company is committed to the safety of all persons that work in its plant, to the protection of the environment and to the community which surrounds the plant, and to the advancement of human health and safety.  The Waco facility has committed substantial resources to the engineering and design of the wastewater pretreatment system to minimize the likelihood of accidental releases and to minimize the risk to the associates (employees), the local community and the surrounding environment.  This commitment is also demonstrated by the plant's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  If a release does occur, plant personnel are trained and equipped to provide an almost instantaneous response, and when necessary, to coordinate with the Waco-McLennan County Emergency Planning Committee to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n3.  Prevention Program\n\nThe plant complies with all applicable accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThe plant's five year accident history is exemplary.  During this period, there has not been a release in excess of a reportable quantity or one that has caused serious injury, property damage or adverse environmental consequences.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe plant has a written emergency response plan to respond to an accidental release of aqueous ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia.  The plan is designed to minimize the potential for adverse effects of chemical exposure on human health through a combination of containment, control, evacuation procedures, and the use of personal protective equipment.  It further directs appropriate personnel to provide any required notifications to regulatory agencies and the public.  Employees of the facility have established and maintained a strong relationship with the Waco-McLennan County Emergency Planning Committee and the loacl Fire Department.\n\n6.  Future Safety Plan\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  The Company is committed to constant improvement in this area.  No changes to current plans and procedures are contemplated at this time.  Periodic reviews of safety and release prevention and preparedness measures are and will continue to be undertaken."
