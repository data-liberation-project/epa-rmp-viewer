Operating in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is focused on preventing serious process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The process safety management (PSM) program demonstrates this focused commitment.  The PSM program involves the application of management systems and performance management practices to control process hazards through objectives, programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process and its Tenets of Operation guiding principles.  Although the management systems for chemical process operations target continuous improvement in the storage, use, and manufacturing of regulated substances, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain a process-related incident in the event one should occur.  \n\nAdditionally, the management systems and performance management practices used at the Pasadena Plastics Complex are measured using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  Careful attention to the right measurements helps to ensure that performance trends, both positive and negative, are recognized early and are acted upon appropriately.\n\nSafety and environmental incidents are to be reported immediately.

Investigations will be conducted with the objective of determining the causes and prevention of future incidents.\n\nThe knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenance records, case histories, and trend analysis of incidents will provide basic information and potential changes that can be used to help further prevent catastrophic events.  As a tool to help manage this knowledge, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has implemented a Knowledge Management System (KMS).  This corporate computer based system assists in tracking and sharing environmental, health and safety recommendations, changes and incidents.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Pasadena Plastics Complex located in Pasadena, Texas operates several plastic resin manufacturing processes and one specialty chemical manufacturing process. \n\nThe plastic resin manufacturing processes utilize various regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, isobutane, propane, and pentane to produce plastic resin.   The plastic resin manufacturing process also utilizes the regulated toxic chemical chlorine in quantities below the threshold limit for process water treatment.\n\nThe specialty chemical manufacturing process utilizes the regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, 2-methylpropene and propane to produce a specialty chemical.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, Pasadena Plastics Complex.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is an OSHA PSM regulated facility.  Therefore, the elements of the Pasadena Plastics Complex PSM program / OSHA PSM standard, which essentially mirror the prevention program requirement of the EPA's RMP standard, have been in place since 1992.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe in"

This system requires that any change executed address the following: the technical basis for the proposed change; the impact of the change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  \n\nAffected process safety information (e.g., mechanical, electrical/instrument, chemical, and operating limits) and procedures (e.g., operating, maintenance, and safe work) are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. A PSR is conducted for the following types of changes: equipment, facilities, and/or process chemicals, technology, and software. The PSR serves as a final check prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into the process at a new facility and conducted prior to start-up, commissioning, or engagement of the change, for existing, modified facilities.  The PSR must confirm the following: a PHA has been performed for new facilities and that PHA recommendations have been resolved; MOC requirements have been executed for changes to modified facilities; construction and equipment installation is in accordance with design specifications; training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed; and, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIncidents, which resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical, are investigated by a cross-section of plant"

This program is a Systems of Safety process developed by United Steal Workers (USW) Union utilizing a logic tree investigative methodology to determine the root causes of accidents, incidents and near misses.  The TOP program is comprised of three interdependent elements:  1) measurement of the success of the facility\u00bfs health and safety systems, 2) systems of safety and incident investigation training program and 3) a full-time union health and safety representative program.  The incident investigation process is fully administered by the TOP Facilitators.\n\nOnce the results of the incident investigation are available, incidents including findings and recommended actions are summarized and communicated throughout the Complex.  The full incident investigation report is available to any employee upon request through the Safety Department or through the Knowledge Management System (KMS).\n\nAn incident review team, comprised of a cross section of employees, meets on a monthly basis to review incidents that have occurred.  The review identifies important trends, global lessons learned and potential safety issues that need additional attention. The results of these reviews are shared with employees through the Sequential Safety Meeting process as part of the Employee Safety Process.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts compliance audits to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the PSM Program at Pasadena Plastics Complex; to ensure that each program element complies with the standard; and to ascertain whether the programs' internal procedures and practices are adequate and are being implemented.
