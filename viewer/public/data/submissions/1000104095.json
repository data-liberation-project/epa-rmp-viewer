The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Bluebell Gas Plant's processes and/or procedures. Personnel are informed of and trained in any changes to the emergency response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Bluebell Gas Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Bluebell Gas Plant has effective communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department). This communication provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Bluebell Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills, and the gas plant provides refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs part of the Bluebell Gas Plant commitment to continuously improve the safety of our processes, some of the initiatives and measures that have been taken or are on-going include:\n1. Completed a risk-based Building Siting study based on OSHA and API RP guidelines to determine the risk to building occupants from external explosion or fire and developed a plan.\n2. Plant equipment is being inspected, both externally and internally, and corrective and preventative measures are being taken to address potential hazards, when necessary."

The plant has not experienced any reportable accidents in this timeframe. Releases that did occur at the plant involving regulated substance were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the u"

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigations reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Bluebell Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Audit findings are forwarded to the company's EHS group for resolution. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in the audits. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit finding are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Bluebell Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility:\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Bluebell Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAll incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Equipment manufacturer's written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Bluebell Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repair. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant uses safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractor Safety\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a substantive change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are managed in a central database and reported to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant maintains written procedure that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. In addition, the Bluebell Gas Plant's Operating Procedures provide guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper and lower limits. Operating Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Bluebell Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically r"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Bluebell Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP and What-if/Check list analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. OSHA and the EPA recognize these analysis techniques as approved methodologies for conducting PHAs. Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering and safety expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestion for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are managed in a central database and reported to the company's local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, are scheduled and resolved in a timely manner. All approved mitigations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic re"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and issued to each employee and addresses each element of the accident prevention program. In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Process Engineering Department, in conjunction with plant personnel, is assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. PSM and Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) files have been prepared to help employees readily locate any necessary process safety information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure) in the plant's Operating Procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\nAlso, the gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide inf"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant located near Roosevelt, UT separates ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas. As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g. methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane). The Bluebell  plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Bluebell plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Bluebell Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part"
