This gate is electrically operated with either key card access or manual operation from within the facility administration building when the call box is activated.

Chlorine detectors are stationed at critical areas and connected to audible and visual alarms.  This system and its sensors is tested routinely in accordance with established manufacture protocols.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.

This RMP covers facility #1000 0002 4065 (New Design Road Water Treatment Plant).  This facility is the largest of the Water Treatment Plants (WTP) owned and operated by Frederick County.\n\nThis facility treats about 7.0 mgd of water drawn from the Potomac River.  The New Design Road facility provides water service to 64,943 residential customers  and 1,642 commercial /industrial accounts.  Thirty thousand pounds of Chlorine (15 ton containers) is the maximum amount of Chlorine that is stored at this facility at any given time.  At this time there are no other hazardous chemicals stored at or above the reportable quantities.  There has never been a release of Chlorine at this facility that has escaped off-site.  \n \nFrederick County insurance carriers make site inspections of DWSU facilities including the New Design Road WTP.  These inspections include a review of policies, procedures, training, environmental permits, contingency plans, and tier II inventories.  The last insurance inspection for this facility was completed on 6/2/2023.  Frederick County is self-insured for contractor liability insurance and a third party inspects the facility.  As a result of the last audit Frederick County Division of Fire and Rescue conducted a Hazardous Materials Pre-Emergency Response Plan in 2023.  This facility is also visited by the Frederick County Department of Fire & Rescue services annual to familiarize new staff with the facility.  \n\n\nSECTION II & III\n\nBoth Release scenarios used in this RMP use a single ton container of chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "y record of this facility, it is believed that this is the largest amount of chlorine that would be released in a single incident.  Please note that this facility has an enclosed chlorine storage area.  Chlorine sensors are connected to a chlorine scrubber system.  In the unlikely event that a chlorine leak occurs, chlorine would be contained within the room, with the air in the room being evacuated through the chlorine scrubber system. \n \nThe first scenario in this RMP is a chlorine gas release that takes place over a 10 Minute period of time.  This time is the estimated time that it would take the sensors on the scrubber system to activate and alarm, personnel to respond with appropriate PPE and equipment and then begin a valve or line repair, or seal the container.  It should be noted that this facility uses vacuum regulators and in the unlikely event that a line were to break the chlorine feed system would lose vacuum and the system would shut down thus no chlorine leak through a line break.\n\nThe second scenario is a rupture of a fusible plug (relief valve) with the total contents of the container empting in eight (8) minutes.  This time frame is based on the  of the fusible plug and emptying of the entire container.\n\n\nSECTION IV & V\n\nFrederick County DWSU does not use or store flammable chemicals/materials subject to RMP reporting requirements, therefore there are no scenarios submitted for flammable materials.\n\n\nSECTION VI\t\n\nThe New Design Road WTP has an excellent safety record.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the 40 years plus operation of this facility.\n\n\nSECTION VII & VIII\n\nWhat-if & What-if/Checklists were used to update the PHA for this facility.  Review of the facility specific SOPs and Division policies and procedures are conducted annually.\n\nBecause of the critical nature of water supply, Frederick County DWSU has built redundancy into many of its most critical processes.  This redundancy included dual power and generators for pow"
