In each case of chemicals being handled, strict safety measures are taken pursuant to the hazards applicable.  Personal protection equipment is worn when warranted including chemical goggles, protective aprons, chemical gloves, and/or dust masks.  Adequate time is allowed for proper handling.  Our company schedules and holds quarterly training sessions on safety for any and all hazards present at our facility including chemicals.  \n\nFACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThis facility is a grain elevator.  We dry and store grain, custom mill feed, sell dry fertilizer, liquid nitrogen (28-0-0), anhydrous ammonia, ag chemicals, and also custom apply fertilizer and herbicides.  We use anhydrous ammonia for a nitrogen source for field corn.  The ammonia plant consists of two storage tanks  and associated piping, valves, and nurse tank connectors on the fill risers.  We also have 25 nurse tanks.  \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accident Prevention Rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with EPCRA 302 and ANSI Standards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property, or environmental damage.  Evacuations or shelterings are in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Archer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Then evacuate people and notify the Local and National Response Center if the leak amounts to more than 100 lbs.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company plans to continue to schedule and hold safety classes i"
