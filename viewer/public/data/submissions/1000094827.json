The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components. As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nThere are no incidents meeting reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History. All releases are documented and investigated, even if they do not meet the reporting criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a).\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration system, Perdue's Perry facility has a well-defined incident command system. The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release, and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials. Perdue continues to train our associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conduct mock drills at least annually. The Emergency Response Plan was designed to confirm with 29 CFR 1910.119. Perdue's officials have discussed the company's response program with our local fire department representatives. \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Perry facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality.
