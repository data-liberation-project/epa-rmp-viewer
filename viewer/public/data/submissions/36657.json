Russell.\r\nCraig Engelhard, our Safety Manager, is a member of the AMI, American Meat Institute, \r\nsafety committee. During these conferences, they have addressed topics of Process Safety \r\nManagement for Ammonia Refrigeration, electrical safety, written SOP's dealing with \r\nthreat and risk. And I plan on joining the IIAR this summer. We have a very good \r\nrelationship with our local OSHA office, and have favorably united on different programs \r\nwith them to create and maintain a safe facility as possible. To show another example for \r\nour commitment to our employees, we were the first food processing facility in the \r\nUnited States, to allow NIOSH to review our practices and procedures and used their \r\nrecommendations to help our company be more efficient with proper procedures. We \r\nhave monthly safety meetings that cover different safety topics. This will range from \r\nammonia within our facility to safety awareness at home. Being a ready-to-eat food \r\nprocessor, food safety is an on going procedure on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nTraining is also considered to be very important at Cloverdale. Our Safety Manager has \r\nattended numerous safety seminars, and myself, Larry Huether, have completed the \r\nPSM/RMP schooling at Garden City Community College in Garden City, Kansas. I \r\nattended this school in May, I felt before attending that we had a very good RMP \r\nprogram, after the schooling, I learned on how I can even make it better.\r\nWe also had a RMP audit by E.P.A. auditors from the Denver, Colorado office on May 8, \r\n2002. After this audit, we updated our existing PHA, process safety information and the \r\nmechanical integrity program.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the topics discussed at our monthly safety meetin"

During this time we tour the \r\nentire facility, discuss anything that might be a danger to our facility or employees and \r\nrevisit our emergency response program. \r\nOur emergency response program is: if we have a leak that is 50 ppm, we are trained to \r\nwear a MSA gas mask, if the leak reaches 300 ppm, all employees evacuate the building. \r\nAt this time we contact our local fire department and inform them of an ammonia leak. \r\nOur fire department will then contact a local gas refinery company, Tesoro, which has \r\ntrained personnel with the proper attire to respond to hazardous chemicals. During our \r\norientation for new employees and monthly safety meetings, our employees have been \r\nexplained where to congregate once leaving the building, depending on wind direction. \r\nAnd all supervisors have been trained on being accountable for the employees working in \r\ntheir department. The maintenance department has a hand held ammonia detector located \r\noutside the facility, which will be used to monitor the level of ammonia before reentering \r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nThe system in place for ammonia detection is a Manning leak detection system. All of \r\nour ammonia compressors and vessels are in one room; therefore the detector is in the \r\ncompressor room with the display outside in the maintenance shop area.
