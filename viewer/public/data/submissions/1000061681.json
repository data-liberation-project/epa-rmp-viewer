      "SummaryText": "The Behr Process Corporation Distribution Center located at  3135 Old Highway M, Imperial, Missouri (Imperial DC or facility) is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provision (CAPP) regulations, also known as the Risk Management Plan, or RMP regulations, found at 40 CFR Part 68.  The CAPP rule requires covered facilities to complete and submit a risk management plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), and to develop and implement a prevention program that consists of an analysis of the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release, summary of the five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nThe Behr facility stores products in aerosol cans that contain flammable propellants listed as a regulated substances in 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart F.  Based on the maximum storage capacity of the aerosol storage room at the distribution center, the Behr facility exceeds the applicable threshold of 10,000 pounds (lb.) of a flammable regulated substance.  Therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP regulations.  Based on the worst case scenario modeled using RMP*Comp, and the accident history of the facility related to the storage of aerosol can products, the facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements.ments.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial DC is a warehouse operation where products in consumer packaging, including aerosol cans, are received, stored and ultimately shipped to various retail locations.  The aerosol room is a 51-foot by 73-foot concrete construction room protected by a foam fire system, explosion proof lighting and two (2) self-closing fire doors activated by fusible links. The aerosols are stored on the floor and in racks located against the wall.    The aerosol can storage room is equipped with foam sprinkler system.  The storage area has a capacity of approximately 360,000 aerosol cans.  The aerosol cans are 13 ounces (oz.) by weight and are stored in boxes of either six, 12"

      "SummaryText": "or 24 cans per box.    \r\n\r\nThe aerosol cans contain various spray products.  Based on information provided by Behr, the products themselves do not contain any RMP toxic or flammable substances; however, the propellants added to the cans include the following RMP-regulated substances: propane, butane, and isobutane.  Each can may contain up to 60% by weight of a mixture of these flammable substances. \r\n\r\nThe Imperial DC meets the Program Level 1 criterion as follows:\r\n1. The facility has not had a release from the aerosol can storage area in the last five (5) years that\r\nreached an off-site receptor\r\n2. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using inputs assuming the propellant is a maximum\r\nof 60% by we1ght of the contents of a 13 ounce can. Modeling runs were completed based on a\r\nsingle propellant and a mixture of the three propellants. The results were the same: 0.006 miles, or\r\napproximately 32 feet. The nearest public receptor is approximately 140 feet south of the\r\naerosol can storage area.\r\n3. A copy of the facility's Emergency Business Plan, dated September 2016 has been submitted to the Antonia Fire Department.  This plan is required to be reviewed and updated at least every two years and any changes will be submitted to the Antonia Fire Department within 30 days. Representatives of the Antonia Fire Department have toured the DC facility several times."
