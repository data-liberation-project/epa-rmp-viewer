The general partners of SRWCLP are Conoco Global Power Developments - Sabine Inc. and NRG Sabine River Works GP LLC.  The limited partners of SRWCLP are Conoco Global Power Assets Sabine Inc. and NRG Sabine River Works LP LLC.  The SRWCLP power plant is located within the boundaries of the DuPont Sabine Riverworks Plant.  The power plant is operated and maintained by DuPont personnel under contract to the owner, which will require approximately 26 fill-time equivalent employees.  On-site management oversight is the responsibility of the power plant Operations Director, who is an employee of SRWCLP.  Because DuPont operates the facility, all safety-related activities at the power plant adhere to the corporate policies of the E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company.  These policies can be summarized as follows:\n\n- All safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\n- The Goal is Zero.  Zero injuries and zero incidents.\n\nCorporate policies are embodied in the numerous Safety, Health, Environmental, and Engineering Standards which apply globally.  At Sabine River Works, the policies are implemented through the site Safety, Health and Environmental Manual and Process Safety Management Manual.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe SRWCLP Power Plant is situated within the boundaries of the DuPont Sabine River Works Plant, which is located approximately two miles south of the city of Orange in a rural setting on FM 1006.  The DuPont plant site is located on 1500 acres evenly divided between manufacturing processes, the employee recreation area, and bio-oxidation ponds.  The facility is secured by a chain-link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24-hour security force.\n\nThe power plant is a gas-fired combustion turbine cogeneration plant that produces steam and electricity.

      "SummaryText": "educing nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired turbine, aqueous ammonia (28 percent ammonia by weight) is vaporized and injected into the turbine exhaust.  The ammonia acts as a reagent in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides across a solid catalyst bed.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is stored on site in a single storage tank.  The total capacity of the ammonia storage and feed system exceeds the threshold quantity for applicability to 40 CFR Part 68, the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  There are no other toxic or flammable materials on site that exceed RMP threshold levels.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a toxic substance is the assumed failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  Based on the RMP regulation, the WCS is the immediate release of the entire inventory of liquid aqueous ammonia, forming an evaporating pool.  This maximum quantity of 28,012 gallons of solution would be contained within a 966 square foot containment system (i.e., a concrete dike) which is designed to act as passive spill release mitigation.  Under these conditions, the RMP rule specifies that the scenario be modeled as an evaporating pool contained within this diked area.\n\nThe WCS was modeled using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance reference tables and equations.  According to these methods, the WCS produces a vapor cloud that extends from the release to a distance that encompasses public receptors as defined by EPA.  The extent of the vapor cloud is defined by the EPA toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm).  Public receptors that could be affected by the WCS include off site residential, recreational, and industrial receptors.  These receptors were identified using U.S. Census Bureau data via the Landview program, supplemented by a visual survey.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for aqueous ammonia involves the assumed failure of a one-inch ammonia line from the bottom"

The ARS was modeled using EPA OCA Guidance reference tables and equations, with the dike acting as passive mitigation.  No active release mitigation was credited in the ARS modeling analysis.\n\nThe modeled ARS distance to the toxic endpoint exceeds the boundaries of the power plant, and encompasses portions of the surrounding DuPont Sabine River Works Plant.  The DuPont plant is a separate stationary source and is therefore an industrial off site receptor according to EPA definitions.  No residential, recreational, or other receptors were identified within the modeled ARS impact distance.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe SRWCLP Power Plant implements management systems and practices that meet or exceed RMP Level 2 Prevention Program requirements.  The power plant is not subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard because the aqueous ammonia concentration (28 percent by weight) is below the PSM threshold of 44 percent by weight.  The facility is classified as NAICS Code 221112, fossil fuel power generation.  As described above, the WCS could affect off site receptors.  This set of conditions dictates Prevention Program 2 applicability under the RMP regulation.\n\nPrevention Program 2 requirements are defined according to the following elements:\n\n- Safety information;\n- Hazard review;\n- Operating procedures;\n- Training;\n- Maintenance;\n- Compliance audits; and\n- Incident investigation.\n\nThe requirements of these elements are met or exceeded through implementation of safety procedures developed to comply with the more rigorous PSM standard.  DuPont personnel operating the power plant conduct their activities under control of the safety programs of the surrounding DuPont facility, which is subject to the PSM regulation.  All activities adhere to the requirements of DuPont Corporate SHE Standa"

The ammonia system is subjected to preventive maintenance inspections and testing to ensure its ongoing integrity.  Future system modifications, if required, will be controlled under a strict management of change program to ensure that appropriate ammonia design standards are applied.  Management of change also ensures that proper hazard review is conducted, training is performed, and operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures are kept up-to-date.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe SRWCLP Power Plant will begin operations 2001, and as such, has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia.  Therefore, no accidents have resulted in either on site or off site effects as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 for five-year accident history reporting.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response program which is in place to protect worker health and public safety.  The program is coordinated with the community response plan maintained by the Orange County LECP.  The facility plan includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a release of ammonia.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures; evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation; and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. \n\nPlant personnel are trained and equipped to respond to releases of the ammonia.
