Regular audits are conducted as detailed in Section 4 to ensure that these programs are in place and functioning well at the Martinez plant.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe process unit at the plant regenerates sulfuric acid from \"spent\" sulfuric acid which is received from oil refineries. Oleum is also produced in the process. Current operations at Martinez are performed by 41 full time employees. Operation of all equipment and processes is performed by these full time employees. Contractor personnel are used for some maintenance activities as required by plant operations. Contractor personnel receive training in accordance with their potential contact with hazardous materials or when assigned to work with equipment which could affect the processing or the handling of hazardous materials. \n\nSulfuric acid is the primary product at the facility. The majority of this sulfuric acid is shipped to refineries and used in the manufacturing process for gasoline.  The strength of the acid produced at the Martinez Plant varies from 93% to 105.5% (oleum). These different strengths satisfy a wide variety of applications, including metals mining, processing pulp and paper, agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and water treatment.\n\nThe chemicals used or stored in the Martinez plant that are covered by the RMP regulation are ammonia (NH3), oleum (H2SO4 supersaturated with SO3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2 dissolved in lubricant spent acid (LSA)). Table 1 identifies the location, quantity, and function of these hazardous materials. \n\nTable 1\n\nMaterial:           Ammonia\nUnit:                 Ammonia Storage\nFunction:         Removal of sulfur dioxide from effluent gas\nMax Inventory: 198,000 pounds\nProgram Level: 3\n\nMaterial:           Oleum\nUnit:                 Oleum Tower/Storage\nFunction:         Product\nMa"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Rhodia Martinez Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors working onsite are expected to work according to all of the safe work practice policies in place for our employees. \n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nThe Martinez Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period that meet the definition.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

No credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.  The effected distance for the WCS was calculated using the look-up tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants that was officially accepted by the EPA on October 28th, 1998.  These look-up tables were used to be consistent with other stationary sources that store anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe maximum distance to the given toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm is 5 miles.  This toxic endpoint is determined by the EPA and corresponds with the ERPG2 value for ammonia.  The definition of ERPG2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all persons exposed for up to 1 hour will not experience or develop irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nUsing the census data from LandView III, the estimated population within the worst-case scenario circle is about 34,000.  This population includes residences, schools, hospitals, child-care facilities, nursing homes, libraries, churches, parks, business/industrial facilities and correctional facilities.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for each toxic substance stored on site was selected from the results"

PHAST is a dispersion modeling program that takes into consideration more details than the look-up tables allow.\n\nAmmonia Alternate Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of ammonia at the Martinez Plant  is defined as a failure of a hose during the unloading of an ammonia truck.  The truck is equipped with an excess flow valve that closes at a flow rate above 283 lb/min.   The hose rupture was assumed to be big enough to get the maximum flow out of the excess flow valve, but small enough not to close the valve.  This represents the most conservative assumptions.  The driver is present at the unloading station during the entire unload process.  The truck is equipped with an emergency handle in the back that will close the valve if pulled.  This can be done by the driver as soon as a problem is observed.  For this scenario it was assumed that it takes the driver 3 minutes to pull the emergency handle.  This is once again conservative.  The result is a spill of 849 pounds of ammonia in 3 minutes time. \n\nThe maximum distance to the given toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm is 0.6 miles.  This toxic endpoint is determined by the EPA and corresponds with the ERPG2 value for ammonia.

This has been very successful as a preventative measure.\n\nOleum\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of oleum at the Martinez Plant  is defined as a leak in the circulation loop for the storage tank, which is located outside of the containment building.   A failure of the pipe was estimated to result in a pinhole leak 1/8\" in length.  It was assumed that the leak continues unnoticed for two hours.  This is very conservative since a cloud would result making the leak immediately noticeable to operating personnel, who could then shut down the unit remotely from the control room.  The total quantity of SO3 released in a two hour period would be about 143 pounds.  \n\nThe maximum distance to the given toxic endpoint of 0.01 mg/L is 0.3 miles.  This toxic endpoint is determined by the EPA and corresponds with the ERPG2 value for SO3.

A high pressure interlock that stops the nitrogen flow to the trailer.  This interlock would prevent putting any additional pressure on the trailer.\n2. A pressure relief valve located on the trailer that will relieve at 42 pounds per square inch.  The relief of this valve would remove the excess pressure from the trailer and not allow it to reach a pressure high enough to rupture.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.
