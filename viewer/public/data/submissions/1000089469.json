This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe COSF has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The COSF primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. The facility periodically updates and re-validates the PHA to assure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and identify new potential hazards. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operational. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe COSF maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of operations such as:"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\n\r\nThe Central Oil Stabilization Facility (COSF) is located in Weld County near the intersection of Weld County Roads 49 and 30.  This is approximately 11 miles east of Platteville and 7 miles north of the intersection of Weld County Road 49 and the exit off Interstate Highway 76.    \r\n\r\nThe Central Oil Stabilization Facility (COSF) receives light oil and condensate via pipeline from multiple well sites in the Denver Julesburg Basin.  The purpose of the facility is to stabilize the condensate and lower its vapor pressure by removing the light hydrocarbons that are dissolved in the condensate.  These light hydrocarbons, which include methane, ethane, propane and butane are removed by heating the condensate in on-site stabilizers.  The light hydrocarbon condensable gases that are removed from the condensate are compressed and liquefied and then stored under pressure as a liquid until pipelined to a gas processing facility for further fractionation.  The methane and ethane is pipelined back to a gas processing facility to be sold down a sales line after further processing.  The stabilized liquids are stored in one of two 250,000 barrel floating roof storage tanks located on the Northeast side of the location before being transferred to the rail loading site near Keensburg, CO or to the Whitecliff pipeline injection point located just south of the COSF. All pumps and compressors on site are electrically powered from purchased power off the grid, however there is on-site emergency generation capability.   \r\n\r\nAll operators are experienced and trained to operate all of the equipment at this facility.  Additionally, the tank levels and critical operating parameters are monitored 24/7 by the operators on-site.  They have the ability to shut the entire facility in from the operations room or from multiple ESD locations strategically located around the facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream has a longstanding comm"

Western Midstream has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Western Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered process at the facility.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees of the COSF are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe COSF keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).

Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Covered process operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task(s) and maintain the covered process unit within its safe limits.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe COSF has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operation is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request or need. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe COSF uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe COSF conducts a PSSR for any new facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information or procedure. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction has been completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe COSF has established practices and procedures for the safe operation of fixed, rotating, pressure containing and emergency shutdown equipment. The basic aspects of the program include, but are not limited to the fo"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The COSF incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe COSF has long-standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards and Good Engineering Practice in place to help ensure worker and process safety. These procedures along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe COSF has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe COSF investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the COSF periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Correc"

The final resolution of each findings is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nCOSF is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. COSF has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."
