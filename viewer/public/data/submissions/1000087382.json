      "SummaryText": "Sun Cosmetics (formerly Cathay Industries) is a manufacturer of synthetic iron oxides for cosmetic grade color pigments and magnetic storage media.  One of the raw materials used in this process is agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia (anhydrous means without water).  Approximately 80% of all ammonia produced is used in agriculture as a nitrogen source for corn and a protein source in livestock feeds.  Other common uses for ammonia are metal treating, pharmaceuticals, synthetic textile fibers, plastics, water treatment and commercial refrigeration systems.  Anhydrous Ammonia is classified as a non-flammable gas with a reportable spill quantity of 100 pounds.  Sun Cosmetics uses detailed procedures and employee training to maintain the safe operation of this system.  Detection sensors are strategically located to alert personnel of leaks. Remotely operated shut off valves, internal tank automatic isolation valves, and a remotely operated water deluge system minimizes the effect of a failed component.  Sun Cosmetics participates in the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and invites the local Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team to train on site annually.  Our internal emergency response plan includes coordinating with police, fire, and HAZMAT personnel.  Sun has had no reportable releases or injuries from ammonia in the last 10 years.  Sun is committed to operating this system in a safe and responsible manor, protecting our employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nAccess to the outdoor ammonia storage system is controlled with an 8-foot tall chain link fence topped with barbed wire.  And this system is inside fenced and gated perimeter facility security.  We also have a system of HD cameras on DVR that monitor all facility access points and this ammonia tank storage area.   \n\n\n\nIn 2019 the following mechanical integrity work was completed on the ammonia storage tank system: Storage tank emptied for internal visual and magnaflux inspection o"

      "SummaryText": "f seam welds and shell thickness testing, all system manual valves were rebuilt,  all emergency shut off valves were rebuilt, and storage tank relief valves were replaced.  At completion, the storage tank and piping system was repainted with a two-part protective coating (white) and relabeled for identification.\n\n\n\nIn 2016 this facility hosted a full-scale exercise with the Porter County LEPC and U.S.EPA.  U.S.EPA was the sponsor of this event.  The exercise was designed to test response to an ammonia release, and included participation of Washington TWP Schools, Washington TWP Fire Dept., Valparaiso Fire Dept., PC Sheriff Dept., PC HAZMAT, PC EMS, Porter Hospital ER, PC 911 Communications Center, and IDEM (Indiana Dept. of Environmental Management).  U.S.EPA contracted Tetra Tech, Inc. to design and produce this event.  The production included Controllers, Evaluators, Exercise Planners, Actors/Players and supporting staff, which included Sun Cosmetics production employees.  Our ammonia supplier, Wilson Industries, provided a mobile training tanker for this event.  A semi-truck size cut-away walk-through tanker which they use to provide instruction to emergency responders.  U.S.EPA considered this event a highly successful training exercise.\n\n\n\nIn January 2020 we had a regulatory inspection by U.S.EPA of our Risk Management Program for ammonia.  No NOV's (notice of violation) were issued as a result of that event.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  "
