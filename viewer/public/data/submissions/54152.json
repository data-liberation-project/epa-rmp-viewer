This process is required in order to insure the general public is protected from waterborne illnesses.  Our employees and their families live in this area and we are dedicated to the safe operation of the facility.\n\nSafety Policy: The safety of employees and the public are of primary concern to us.  As part of the private service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment.  Our programs include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive employee training and coordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an emergency.  The facility has a full time well trained maintenance staff along with a well stocked inventory of parts on site allowing for immediate response to any equipment issues.  Automatic alarms, gas detectors and emergency response procedures are also in place.  Other safety features include a chlorine dispensing unit that is designed to automatically shut-off the valve at the chlorine cylinder should there be any loss of vacuum resulting from a leak in the system.  It is a reliable and effective system that provides additional safety to the facility operations. \n\nFacility Description: The facility treats drinking water for the area.  Chlorine gas, stored in 150 pound cylinders, is injected into the water during the treatment process.  A maximum of 4500 pounds of chlorine are in use at any one time.  The injected chlorine gas kills disease causing pathogens during the treatment process.  This process protects the community's drinking water supply from waterborne infectious diseases.\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator. In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, there are numerous government regulations affecting our operations.\n\nAs part of the requirements of this EPA program, we have reviewed our accident hi"

      "SummaryText": "story for the last 5 years and found that we have operated without a reportable chlorine related incident. We are dedicated to safety and our record proves it.\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with the local fire department, the local police department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The Grosse Pointe Fire Department has prepared an emergency response plan for the facility with the intent to provide information for consideration in order to safely and effectively respond to a leak or spill at the facility.  We have training every year for our people and we coordinate with the fire and police departments on a regular basis. Although we take extensive precautions to prevent a chlorine release, we firmly believe in having a plan in case of an emergency. This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid training.\n\nWe will continue to look for ways to improve the safety at our facility as it is a continuous ongoing effort that we take very seriously."
