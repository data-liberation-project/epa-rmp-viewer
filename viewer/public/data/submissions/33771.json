Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented, however, it is in the process of being updated at the Nation Pizza Products, LP (Nation Pizza Products) facility located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n?    Introduction;\n?    Nation Pizza Products policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n?    Hazard Assessment;\n?

Nation Pizza Products is currently developing/updating an Emergency Response/Action Plan (ERAP) that contains procedures, which will be designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a listed toxic substance, it is also a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125 Exemptions ? Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68).\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\nThe Nation Pizza Products facility is located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of custom and branded pizza and dough related products for food marketers and manufacturers, food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311412. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients, pizza, and dough products.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating pizza products. \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #1 is approximately 13,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system #1 is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, and a frigo blast freezer.  This system is a two-stage system with four (4) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.
