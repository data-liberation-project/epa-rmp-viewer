      "SummaryText": "The Central Bi-Products facility located in Redwood Falls, Minnesota is a Rendering facility that handles chlorine, which is considered toxic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide a service to the animal and poultry processing facilities by taking non-edible bi-products and processing by protein conversion into useful products.  The process includes grinding, fluidizing evaporation and additional processes.  \n\nChlorine is used as an oxidizer in odor control systems within the facility.  Chlorine is widely accepted for these applications.  Chlorine is stored in steel cylinders and is conveyed through a vacuum piping system within the facility to points of use.  If the vacuum system fails, the system will automatically shut down.  \n\nSince chlorine is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine  combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place at the facility for many years.  This processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe chlorine system is set up according to the guidelines and recommendation of the Chlorine Institute.  The cylinders are delivered on a routine basis by a reliable firm and the system as previously mentioned operated on a vacuum system connected to the pressurized tank.  Any damage to the system where a pipe is opened to the atmosphere, the valve at the cylinder will automatically close.  \n"

      "SummaryText": "\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Redwood Falls Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Redwood Falls Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the chlorine system.  Furthermore, there have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past 5 years.  \n\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario for this one toxic chemical  as defined by EPA, the worst case release scenario for chlorine would cause a release from the storage cylinder that could travel beyond the facility property boundary.  An alternative, more likely, release scenarios would not travel beyond the facility property because of the large size of the parcel owned by the company. \n\nIn all cases, of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc."
