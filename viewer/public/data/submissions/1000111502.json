The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios a worst case and an alternative case, and also compiles the five-year accident history for all highly hazardous chemical system.\nThe first scenario is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the highly hazardous chemical released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA specified endpoint for highly hazardous chemical is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n7.1.\tWORST CASE   (C) (1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA's RMP Comp Program.  Results demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint for each RMP chemical and are listed in the plant's Process Safety Information (PSI).

Both systems design, construction and maintenance meet or exceed standards for the various chemicals as recommended by manufacturers, NFPA, NEC, etc.   All containers and piping systems are made of chemical compatible steel, alloy or non-metallic compounds. \n\n4.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\nThe plant has been RMP reportable accident free for listed chemicals above the threshold quantity in the past five years.  Our accident incident policy requires that a team investigate each accident, illness, incident or near miss accident within 48 hour for all incidents including PSM or RMP chemicals per plant policy.\n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures contained in the Plant Emergency Response Policy are coordinated with the Harris County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plant's operating procedures.  Emergency response drills are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency"

The PSM/RMP program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall Clean Harbors division wide program and the Clean Harbors Treatment Plant site-specific program.  This is coordinated with the Harris County, Deer Park LEPC, and the County Fire/Rescue Department (including the HazMat Team).\n3.1.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\nClean Harbors has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.  Also a chemical profile is required for each waste stream that is received at the facility.  This profile lists the maximum concentration of each constituent.  The profile is used in the daily evaluation of the quantity of all PSM and RMP chemicals on site.\nOur document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all PSM/RMP operations on site.\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used.\nRefresher training is conducted annually.\nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used"

This plant is one of two sites that Clean Harbors operates in the Deer Park Area.  Clean Harbors has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to TSD plant.  Only the 2027 Independence Parkway South Plant operations and policies are presented in this RMP*eSubmit Plan.\n\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\nThe Clean Harbors Deer Park Plant accidental release prevention policies involve a unified approach that integrates technologies, equipment, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Act's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program, (PSM) 29 CFR-1910-119, of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The OSHA program is similar to the EPA's RMP prevention program and EPA emergency response program.\nClean Harbors provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and RMP safety and prevention programs as outlined in our Employee Participation policy and procedure.  Clean Harbors also provides a variety of technical documents beyond the RMP and PSM-required policies and procedures.   The documents are used to maintain safe operation of the processes and include chemical handling instructions. \n1.1.\tPREDICTIVE FILING (A) (1)\nThe plant is a treatment storage and disposal site that uses incineration for treatment (destruction) of the hazardous waste streams we are permitted to treat.
