The registration for this process is presented in the GRM-PG - Appendix A. \n\n\n\nThe ARBS is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the ARBS utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. The ARBS is located at 7830 Paseo del Norte in the northwestern portion of the City of El Paso, Texas. The ARBS is surrounded by commercial, residential, and vacant land.\n\n\n\nCurrently the ARBS has the potential to store two (2) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room, the total amount of chlorine at this facility is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 42,210 people. The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people. \n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case and alternative scenarios.  The following environmental receptors were identified:\n\n\n\n1. The Rio Grande River.  The ARBS is approximately 1.5 miles east of the Rio Grande River.  The Rio Grande River provides habitat for aquatic wildlife and is classified as a Wild and Scenic River.  \n\n\n\nNo environmental receptors were were identified for the alternative scenario.\n\n\n\n?    Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program "

Formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release (Emergency Response Program).\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Plan\" and the Chlorine Institute's \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\" The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process, and procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \n\n\n\nThe EPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the chlorination process operating procedures to adequately keep the operators informed of human factors that may lead to accidental releases.\n\n"
