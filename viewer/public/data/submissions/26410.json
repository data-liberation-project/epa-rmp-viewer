This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Spectrum Field Services plant is located one mile west of Velma Oklahoma, on old highway 7 and operates a variety of process to produce the following petroleum products:\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n2. Regulated flammable products;\na. Propane   \nb. Butane\nc. Ethane\nd. Methane\ne. Pentane\nf. IsoPentane\ng. IsoButane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 212,655 pound of flammable mixture contained in three vessels.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since the facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such release and to manage their consequence, Passive Mitigation measures include an Automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuate valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergence flare.  This complete process will take at minimum 5 seconds.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable subs"

The release is expected to be isolated by plant operation personnel with 15 minutes or by automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuate valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergence flare.  This complete process will take at minimum 5 seconds.\nSince this facility is located in a populated area, the ARS could affect offsite endpoints or nearby public receptors. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSpectrum Field Services encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:  \n1. Updating, compiling technical documents, and chemical information, \n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n3.  Maintaining good engineering practices,\n4.  Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.\n  Employees have access to all information pertaining to accident prevention program (Safety Program).\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSpectrum Field Services Velma Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These technical documents address the following:\na. Chemical properties, and associated hazards,\nb. Necessary Block Flow diagrams of the process,\nc.  Maximum intended inventories\nd. Upper & Lower Limits of process fixed and rotating equipment,\ne. Equipment design basis and configuration information,\nf. Identification of all necessary Regulatory equipment design documents, and\ng. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices.\n The location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM. \n\nChemical-specif"

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level, composition, in the operator\u00bfs procedures manual.  The facility maintains the process within these limits by using processes controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature, and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nVelma Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered processes.  This process is systematically examined for potential hazards, and identifies the hazards, puts controls in place to manage the hazards, and recommends additional controls, as appropriate.\n\nHazard operability studies (HAZOP), are conducted using a team of Velma\u00bfs employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendation to management of potential hazards identified.  The team finding is forwarded to Velma\u00bfs Management for resolution.  Implementations of mitigation options in response to PHA finding are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team finding are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented an"

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify /demonstrate skills.\n\n\nContractors\n\nVelma Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near Cover Process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazard that they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with\n1. A process overview\n2. Information about safety and health hazards\n3. Emergency response plan requirements and \n4. Safe work practices before beginning work.\n\nIn addition, Velma Gas Plant Management will evaluate the contractor safety program and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-Start Safety Review\n\nSpectrum Field Services, Velma Gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and finding from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSpectrum Field Services Velma Gas Plant maintains a written Operating Procedure of the covered process that addresses primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering practice, and manufactures.   These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate by management.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary by employee\u00bfs suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.   \nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nTraining\n\nVelma Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator, demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards,\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change.\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nVelma Gas Plants promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its finding, develops recommendations to prevent occurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs finding and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\nCompliance Audits.\n\nAt least Every 3 years a Compliance audit addressing all OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineer Practices, are conducted by employees and Management of Velma Gas Plant.
