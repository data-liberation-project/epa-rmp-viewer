      "SummaryText": "Maryland Chemical Company (MCC) stores greater than 1,000 pounds of aqueous 70% hydrofluoric acid at its property.  Thus, 40 CFR Part 68, EPA's Accidental Release Provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990, require the preparation of this Risk Management Plan for its storage.  Because the facility has not had a HF release with off-site impacts within the last 5 years, but the worst-case release scenario indicates that off-site impacts of public receptors would occur, 40 CFR Part 68 requires that MCC prepare a Level 2 Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The critical elements of this plan are summarized below.\n\n*   70% HF is stored in a 7 ft long x 10 ft diameter carbon steel tank with domed ends and a maximum capacity of 5,363 gallons.  It is filled through a 2\" teflon-lined carbon steel pipeline (approximately 60 ft in total length) that enters the tank at its top.  A 2\" vent line is routed through three (3) sealed 55-gallon drums, the first one empty and the others containing water, which scrub vapor emissions, especially during filling of the tank.  Acid from the tank is transferred by gravity drainage through a carbon steel pipeline into shipping containers.  Personnel diluting the acid stand behind a partition to open the valve for addition of acid to the drums which already contain water.\n\n*   The HF tank is surrounded by a secondary containment system with an asphalt floor and concrete-block walls.  It has dimensions of approximately 30 ft long x 12 ft wide x 2.67 ft deep for a total capacity of 7,189 gallons.  Thus, it is capable of containing a release of the entire contents of the tank.\n\n*   Administrative controls at MCC limit the maximum volume of HF in the tank at any time to 4,500 gallons.  No tank truck delivery is made until the volume remaining in the tank is 500 gallons or less.  Maximum delivery of acid based on the capacity of the delivery truck is 4,000 gallons.\n\n*   The HF tank and piping is visually inspected daily by the plant supervisor.  Ultrasonic th"

      "SummaryText": "ickness testing of this equipment is performed annually.\n\n*   The worst-case release scenario of a release of the entire contents of the tank would result in collection of the release in the secondary containment system.  Evaporation of HF from this pool would result in a distance to the toxic endpoint (0.016 mg/l) of 0.3 miles.  Within a circle of this radius, local commercial and industrial establishments would be impacted.  Total residential population in this area, based on the Landview database with 1990 Census data, is 276 persons.  THIS RELEASE SCENARIO IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY.\n\n*   A more likely alternative release scenario would be a 10-minute leak through a 1/8\" hole in the bottom of the tank.  HF from this leak would be collected in the secondary containment system.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/l would be 0.1 miles (530 feet).  Total residential population in this area is 10 persons.\n\n*   MCC personnel performing operations with 70% HF receive 8 hours of general awareness training per OSHA.  In accordance with MCC policy, these personnel also receive an initial 40 hours of HAZWOPER training and an annual 8 hours of refresher training.  These personnel are capable of responding to small releases of HF.\n\n*   MCC has on-site a supply of absorbents, neutralizers, empty drums, drum pumps, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for responding to small releases of HF.  MCC personnel are trained in the proper use of all of this equipment.\n\n*   Transporter personnel deliver loads of 70% HF in tank trucks approximately once a month.  The personnel deliver the acid to the tank through a 2\" teflon-lined carbon steel pipeline.  During delivery, one of the transporter personnel climbs to the top of the tank in order to pressurize the tank truck headspace for pumping of the acid.  This person also controls the shut-off valve in the event of a leaking transfer hose or pipeline.  Another transporter person and MCC personnel continuously monitor the transfer"

As part of this process, senior management at MCC has committed, through policy, communications, and resources, to on-going improvements in chemical distribution safety.  It is committed to regular reviews with manufacturers of the hazards of materials and evaluation of the potential for releases and their impacts.  Finally, the identification and implementation of risk reduction measures are promoted so as to create a safer environment for workers and the surrounding community. \n\n*   Emergency response activities for an HF release are governed by the facility's OSHA Emergency Action Plan.  This plan calls for the use of outside emergency responders in the event of a large release with off-site impacts.  Upon arrival, the coordinator of emergency response activities would be the Baltimore City Fire Department.  Other participants in reponse activities may include private contractors and members of the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Plan (SBIMAP).  Implementation of the emergency response plan is the responsibility of Ms. Jeaneatte Partlow.\n\n*   Implementation of this Level 2 RMP is the repsonsiblity of Ms. Jeanette Partlow, President, Maryland Chemical Company, 1551 Russel Street, Baltimore, MD  21230, 410-752-1800."
