TDI storage tank is designed for truck and marine transport like a containerized cargo. Therefore, it includes features to enhance its ruggedness. The tank is used as a stationary tank at this site. All piping attached to the tank, penetrate tank boundaries from the top.\n\nThe storage tank is set inside a containment area within the building at the facility to minimize the impacts of a release from the tank.\n\nTDI is used in small quantities in the reactors to produce polymers. Transfer is accomplished via a transfer pump that is controlled automatically by a flow meter. The operator sets the desired quantity in the automatic control unit which then transfers the desired amount to a reactor.\n\nHazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Summary\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: \nProcess 1 at 2100 Reliance Pkwy: The worst case scenario considered the discharge of the entire contents of the 12000-gallon storage tank into the diked area. \nProcess 2 at 2051 Reliance Pkwy: The worst case scenario considered the discharge of the entire contents of the 12000-gallon storage tank into the diked area. \n\nThe temperature for both the processes was considered to be 100\u00b0F, representing the maximum ambient temperature in the area over the last three years. It may be added that, given the mass of the regulated substance in the tanks, large day and night temperature fluctuations, the fact that the tank is stored indoors, and that generally high temperature conditions do not last more than a few days, 100\u00b0F represents a very conservative maximum temperature estimate for the liquid.  \n\nALOHA computer software was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.02 ppm. Based on the results, it was concluded that the haz"

      "SummaryText": "Polycoat Products, a division of American Polymers Corporation, has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the TDI Transfer System to enhance its already existing safety programs. Polycoat Products is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its neighbors. Polycoat Products staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.\nPolycoat Products have two contiguous properties in Bedford-2100 Reliance Parkway and 2051 Reliance Parkway. There are 2 six thousand gallons Toluene Di-Isocyanate (TDI) tanks in each building which are considered as two different processes. This RMP represents both the building. The TDI Transfer System, that contains the regulated substance Toluene Di-Isocyanate (TDI), is used for supplying TDI to the polymer production reactors in the process area.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPolycoat Products has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility. This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include specific steps that Polycoat Products management expects of its employees to take to protect health of the employees and the neighbors. The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, earthquake, chemical spill, TDI health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure it is maintained current.  This Plan has been reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Risk Managemen"
