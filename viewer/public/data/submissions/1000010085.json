Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at The Dow Chemical Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of polyurethane systems.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-].  The liquid is stored in a single tank at the facility, and is used in the production polyurethane systems.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for the reported scenarios, were completed using RMP*Comp, Version 1.07 and are described in the data disk for this submission. Changes from the original submission were due to ERPG values for TDI changing from 1 ppm to the current value of 0.2 ppm.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable API / ASME Specifications, Southern Building Code, and Corporate Standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Dow Chemical Company maintains a detailed recor"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis Reviews, Layer of Protection Analysis Reviews, and other reviews.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 9/13/2007.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Dow Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furth"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at The Dow Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of operating procedures was performed on 6/2/2009.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Dow Chemical Company.  The most recent review was performed on 7/15/2009.  Pre-startup audits were held for the rail spur optimization project to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Dow Chemical Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 9/29/2008.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Dow Chemical Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Dow Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effor"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Dow Chemical Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nThe Dow Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.
