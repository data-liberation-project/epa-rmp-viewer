ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nHL Power Company has in place administrative procedures to prevent accidental releases of site regulated substances. These policies can be found in the Process Safety Management Program and in the Business Plan. Emergency response procedures are in place and are presented to new hires as well as annual training for all employees.\n\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHL Power is a 35 MW waste wood fired power plant, which uses Anhydrous Ammonia for emission control,  and Chlorine, which is used in to control microbiological growth in the cooling tower and fire suppression pond.\n\nMaximum tank sizes are 17,638 gallons for ammonia. Chlorine is delivered to the plant in 2000 pound containers. Administrative policies reduce these limits to 85% of tank maximums. The formula for calculating poundage from gallons is; specific gravity * 8.33 = pound per gallon. Anhydrous ammonia has a specific gravity of 0.62, 0.62 * 8.33 = 5.16 pounds per gallon. \n\nThe maximum quantities stored for these two (2) regulated substances are as follows:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: 85% of 17,638 = 14,992 gallons * 5.16 = 77,359 pounds\n\n                 Chlorine:                      two containers or 4,000 pounds\n\n\nIII.  WORST-CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (RMP*Comp)\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst Case Scenario: Tank is struck by a vehicle, which causes a catastrophic release of all contents of the tank. All contents are released in 10 minutes. Release rate is 7,735.9 pounds per minute. Toxic end point is 4.9 miles.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Alternative Case Scenario: Fire on adjacent Propane tank causes the pressure in the Ammonia tank to increase. This increase in pressure causes the tank relief valve to lift. Fog nozzle directed to ammonia tank, which causes the pressure to drop, which allows the relief valve to reseat. Release rate: 326 pounds per minute. Distance to toxic"

Rate of release: 200 pounds per minute. Distance to toxic endpoint: 3.0 miles.\n\nChlorine Alternative Case Scenario: Regulator on end of cylinder blows out of tank leaving a 1-inch square hole. Rate of release: 123 pounds per minute. Distance to toxic endpoint: 0.5 miles.\n\nIV. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nHL Power Company has administrative procedures in place to prevent overfilling of the Ammonia tank. An offloading procedure has been developed to prevent releases during the filling of this tank, and also one for unloading & replacing Chlorine containers. Plant speed limits are in place and enforced. A remote camera that is controlled from the control room is used to monitor offloading operations. All personnel receive training for all tasks involving these chemicals. Emergency procedures can be found in the Business Plan. Training information can be found in the Process Safety Management Program. Training material can also be found in the Certification Training Program.\n\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidents involving these regulated substances since 1988 when the plant was built. \n\nVI. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHL Power Company Emergency Response Program is contained in the Business Plan. This plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed. It is also distributed to all agencies as directed.\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nHL Power Company has a system for communication with the employees on matters relating to occupational safety and health which include:\n\nThe labor/management Safety Committee meets monthly to discuss safety items. Employees are encouraged to discuss safety and health hazards with committee members. Committee members then bring this up for discussion at the monthly meeting.  Communication is kept anonymous if requested by the employee.\n\nWeekly Safety Meetings addressing sa"
