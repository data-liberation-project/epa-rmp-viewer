      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility: \n\nKeyera is committed to the safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training.  Keyera has developed a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Vancouver Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also maintain incipient stage fire fighting equipment on site. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\n\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane dealers.  The facility consists of four 30,000-gallon tanks with a holding capacity of approximately 110,000 pounds each of liquid propane.  In addition the facility has the capacity to unload four 30,000-gallon rail cars.  There are both manual and automatic emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site. Currently this facility is non-operational.  The tanks are still onsite, but have been emptied of propane except for residual.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one of the 30,000-gallon storage tanks or the connecting piping.  However the tanks now have only residual amounts of propane.  Even in worst case, the scenario would result in only a small vapor cloud explosion. It assumes all the  remaining propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation system is considered.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite to 0.04 miles, and the only  are employees in thge industrial park location.  Keyera has multiple safeguards in "

      "SummaryText": "place which make this scenario very unlikely.  Our alternative release scenario involves a propane release from a multi-port 2.5 inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation system considered in this scenario.  A total of 10 pounds of propane is released.  The resulting distance to the LFL is <.1 miles and does not extend off-site.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: \n\nKeyera Energy, Inc. acquired the facility in June 2006.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place.  To the best of our knowledge no such incident occurred prior to acquisition by Keyera Energy, Inc.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Vancouver Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  We also have trained employees in incipient stage fire fighting.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have been provided the opportunity to visit our facility and inspect our propane storage system.  \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nKeyera Energy, Inc. will continually strive for safety improvement.  Periodic process safety inspections will be conducted followed with timely response."
