International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) RMP and PSM Guidelines have been implemented at this facility. Recent changes in operation require additional NH3 inventory for easier start-up. The plant was originally designed for future maximum capacity of 11,550 lbs in the largest vessel. By operating at this level now gives us more flexibility.\n\n\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n\n2.    Determine Program Level\n\n3.    Establish a Management System\n\n4.    Conduct a 5 year Accident History\n\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at JAIN Farm Fresh Foods, Inc. (Frozen Ingredients Division) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Packing and storage of fresh produce..  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  These substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration.\n\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations and Public Domain Software (RMP Comp).  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration System.  In this scenario 11,550 lb. of Ammonia (80% of largest vessel) is released.  The toxic liquid released inside an enclosed space in direct contact with outside is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration system compressor.  The scenario involves the release of 360 lb. of toxic gas from a compressor shaft seal leak.  It's assumed the system would be manually and/or automatically shut down in no more than 30 minutes Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoi"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, and applicable 2007 CA Mechanical Code.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nJAIN Farm Fresh Foods, Inc. (Frozen Ingredients Division) maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated or replaced if required at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner and not more than 2.5 years.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 08/19/2018.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, JAIN Farm Fresh Foods, Inc. (Frozen Ingredients Division) maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is annually reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nJAIN Farm Fresh Foods, Inc. (Frozen Ingredients Division) ha"
