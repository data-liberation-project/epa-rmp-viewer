FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no reportable releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that have had an off-site impact, or that have resulted in significant property damage to either on-site or off-site receptors.\n\nV.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release in a defensive fashion.  The site Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Nampa Fire Department.\n\nVI.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      The facility recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program may need improvement as their company grows and the facility ages.. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of living documents and procedures that require  attention, development, and revision as needed. This is demonstrated by addressing safety issues as they are made aware.  Continued improvement of SOPs during the certification process, ensuring that all equipment is labeled correctly, ammonia piping is correctly labeled, valving is identified and placed into the Technical Operating Specifications as well as the Pressure Relief Valves are replaced as required.  And all replacement of equipment related to the ammonia process are rated for anhydrous ammonia.  Annual mechanical integrity inspections are conducted to ensure integrity of the equipment and piping is not compromised."

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     The facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and continue to be the responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     The facility believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Maintenance Engineer has been involved with the development and implementation of the PSM and RMP program.  The Maintenance Engineer assumes the major responsibility for operating the facility in a safe manner. \n     The Emergency Action Plan has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Nampa Fire Department.  \n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     The facility is a Public Refrigerated Warehouse.  The refrigeration system utilizes anhydrous ammonia to run the refrigeration system.  \n\nIII.   DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility considers the PSM/RMP programs to be living documents that are updated and revised as needed to maintain their viability.\n\n     The facility emphasizes and insists on  employee participation from the Maintenance manager in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of the PSM/RMP program.  He is and has been involved in each aspect of the program and has been an intricate part of a successful program.  \n\n     The facility maintains a pro-active open-door policy"
