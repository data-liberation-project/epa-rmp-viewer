Water Plant #1 and four other plants have quanties \n\nof regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.

The prevention program \n\nensures that the facility is operated under safe\n\nconditions and that any risk of an accidental release due to human \n\nerror,the facility's prevention program ensures that\n\noperating procedures are current and reviewed annually.Training also\n\nplays a vital part in the facility's program.\n\nEmployees and contractors working near or on the chlorination process \n\nare required to be trained in the chlorination process and the hazards \n\nof chlorine.\n\n\n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, the \n\nprogram ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and\n\npreventive maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted \n\nengineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations, and \n\nplanned main"

Precautions are taken to\n\nensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and testes,\n\nthat all changes on the process are authorized, and\n\nemployees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nThe facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address \n\nthe hazards in the chlorination process and to\n\nevaluate and control where potential for a chlorine release exists. \n\nEmployees were involved in determining hazards of\n\nthe process and subsequent consequences.
