      "SummaryText": "Our facility has two 12,000 gallon storage tanks and equipment receiving ammonia from truck transports and transferring ammonia from storage to nurse tank for delivery to customers.  Fieldton Butane & Fertilizer has always worked hard in its forty-seven years of business to meet and exceed regulations relating to storing and transferring ammonia. Records show that that we have never had any sccidents or release with off site consequences. Safety is first, we train employees annually on safety features include water on sight,replace hoses and valves as specified with locks , pressure relief valves to prevent overpressuring and rupturing of tanks, excess flow valves to prevent major release if hose ruptures or breaks. In addition, we have coordinated with locl fire department to respond to emergencies. We have analized the worst case release scenario defined by the EPA COMP , this scenario involves a vapor cloud release of the entire contents of a 12,000 gal storage. The information reflects a distance of four miles from our facility.  This scenario would be highy unlidely the it would ever occur.   The most likely would be an event of a hose break caused by a pull away or rupture of a hose. In this case scenario would reflect a release that would affect up to .5 mile. Inthis case it would not affect any schools , hospitals or parks in any distance . In the last five ammonia sales hve decreased to a mimimum. Inventory has been nearly zero and in the next few months the idea of doing away with it is in consideration."
