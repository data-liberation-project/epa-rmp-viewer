The facility is an existing operating source. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\r\n* Acknowledge the operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\r\n* Incorporate revisions to the RMP pursuant to the requirements of the CalARP and 40 CFR 68 regulations.\r\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These federal and state requirements build upon the provisions of the \u00bfgeneral duty clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\r\n* identify hazards\r\n* design and maintain a safe facility\r\n* prevent releases\r\n* minimize the consequences of releases.\r\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility must take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. BFP has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP for the anhydrous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the RMP regulations and the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\r\nPursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 and CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\r\nThis updated/revised RMP applies to the BFP facility located at:\r\n35586-C Highway 299E\r\nBurney, CA. 96013\r\n\r\nFaci"

This scenario results in the release of approximately 51,000 pounds of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 700 meters and may affect approximately 8 individuals within census tract 127.01, i.e., the zone of impact.\r\nThe alternate release scenario is the failure of the system transfer piping with the spill contents being discharged to existing ground surfaces. This scenario results in the release of approximately 100 pounds of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is within the plant fence-line boundary and may affect approximately 0 individuals within census tract 127.01, i.e., the zone of impact.\r\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, wh"

Design and equipment specifications are verified and the design codes and standards adhere to generally accepted good engineering practices.\r\n* Operating, maintenance, safety, and emergency procedures are revised or developed as necessary. \r\n* For proposed new processes, P&IDs are reviewed and confirmed complete, and a PHA is performed. \r\n* For modified processes, the P&IDs are updated and the PHA is revised as necessary.\r\n* If employee job classifications or job tasks will be affected, training is completed in accordance with all required standards.\r\nIncident Investigations\r\n\r\nThorough investigation of \u00bfincidents\u00bf (any occurrence that results in or could result in catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia) or \u00bfnear misses\u00bf (any situation where conditions existed under which an incident could have occurred, but did not) is another essential element of the RMP program. Incident investigations typically yield perspectives on equipment or process safety that are not normally apparent to plant operations and maintenance staff, such as:\r\n* Incident \u00bfcauses\u00bf outside of the PHA scope.\r\n* Was the facility response appropriate?\r\n* Did the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) function as designed?\r\n* Did the ERP and RMP provide"

The investigation results, including the implementation of all recommendations, are reviewed with facility staff whose job responsibilities are relevant to the findings. Copies of the investigation reports are maintained on site for a minimum of five years, and are used during the periodic PHA re-evaluations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees (including contractors) at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations. Operational safety is achieved by a constant exchange of information with employees to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program. The facility has implemented procedures regarding employee participation in the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and emergency action program. The written employee participation plan and facility policies ensures that:\r\n* Employees at all staff levels are participants in the development and implementation of PHAs. \r\n* Employees at all staff levels are participants in the development of the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and the emergency action pro"

Quite often a change made in one aspect of the process may affect other parts of the process due to facility system integration. Such changes must be reviewed prior to initiation, to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The facility MoC procedures are used to evaluate all changes to the following types of systems:\r\n* Process chemicals (delivery, storage, handling)\r\n* Control technology systems (operation rates, chemicals used, by-products or wastes produced)\r\n* Equipment design and construction\r\n* Operations and maintenance procedures\r\n* Other changes to facility equipment or processes\r\nThe current MoC procedures, developed by NAES and plant staff, are used for the BFP facility to track changes in equipment or processes as identified or planned by facility personnel. Plant staff evaluate the potential impact(s) of the change on operational safety and worker health via a checklist for minor changes or a design review for major changes. The following steps are taken to ensure the safe implementation of the change.\r\n* Prior to startup, process safety information is updated as required. Revised process safety information is placed in the operations, safety, and maintenance manuals.\r\n* Operating procedures are revised in accordance with the new or modified equipment or process design and operations specifications. Updated procedures are placed in the appropriate operations, safety, and maintenance manuals.\r\n* Employees affected by the change (job classification basis) receive training in accordance with the specific training program prior to st"
