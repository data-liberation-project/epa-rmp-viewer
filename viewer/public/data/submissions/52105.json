The facility is an existing operating source. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n* Acknowledge the operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\n\n* Incorporate revisions to the RMP pursuant to the requirements of the CalARP and 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These federal and state requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n* identify hazards\n\n* design and maintain a safe facility\n\n* prevent releases\n\n* minimize the consequences of releases.\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility must take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. BFP has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP for the anhydrous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the RMP regulations and the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 and CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\nThis updated/revised RMP applies to the BFP facility located at:\n\n35586-C Highway 299E\n\nBurney, CA. 96013\n\n\n\nFaci"

In addition, the tank and secondary containment area is equipped with a water deluge system and ammonia sensors.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n\n* Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n\n* Proper operation of all system equipment.\n\n* Internal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity.\n\n* Comprehensive personnel training.\n\n* A written emergency response plan.\n\n* A written hazardous materials management plan.\n\n* Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors.\n\n* Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP.\n\nThe facility is an existing source and has never experienced an accidental release of ammonia or any other hazardous substance in the last 5 years.\n\nThe current emergency response plan and procedures for BFP are discussed in detail in Section 14.0 and Appendix H. The Burney Fire Department (BFD) will be the first responder in an ammonia emergency. BFP personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, BFP personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. BFD will handle spill/release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, BFP may join forces with BFD and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\n\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n\n* Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network, flow controllers, and injection grid.\n\n* Monitoring of tank and system pressures and temperatures.\n\n* Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n\n* Installation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\n\n* Provide all req"

This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MoC review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review will be performed in conjunction with the MoC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. \n\nA pre-startup checklist has been developed to document the pre-startup safety review and to ensure that all of the requirements were addressed prior to the delivery and/or use of any regulated substances. The checklist ensures that the following steps are taken prior to startup:\n\n* Design specification review is conducted for the new or modified equipment and construction. Design and equipment specifications are verified and the design codes and standards adhere to generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n* Operating, maintenance, safety, and emergency procedures are revised or developed as necessary. \n\n* For proposed new processes, P&IDs are reviewed and confirmed complete, and a PHA is performed. \n\n* For modified processes, the P&IDs are updated and the PHA is revised as necessary.\n\n* If employee job classifications or job tasks will be affected, training is completed in accordance with all required standards.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\n\n\nThorough investigation of ?incidents? (any occurrence that results in or could result in catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia) or ?near misses? (any situation where conditions existed under which an incident could have occurred, but did not) is another essential element of the RMP program.
