      "SummaryText": "     The hydrogen fill system at the Fairmont Pkwy location involves both bulk trailer and cylinder filling of hydrogen.  Hydrogen is a flammable gas with an atmospheric pressure boiling point of -423 degrees F.  The hydrogen is stored as a liquid at a pressure of approximately 70 psi in a vacuum-insulated cryogenic storage vessel.  At ambient temperatures it is stored as a gas in cylinders and tubes at pressures up to 2750 psig.  Liquid hydrogen is delivered by tank truck and transferred to a 20,000 gallon cryogenic storage vessel that is maintained through administrative controls at a maximum volume of 18,000 gallons or 10,631 lbs.  This liquid hydrogen is ultra-high purity (UHP) grade and used for specialty applications in customers' processes.  The UHP hydrogen liquid is gravity fed through a set of vaporizers that allows the liquid to expand into a gas.  The gas is then piped to two hydrogen compressors that pump the hydrogen through purification filters and up to three cylinder fill panels and five tube trailer stanchions.  \n\n     The maximum possible inventory of hydrogen on-hand at the facility is 17,415 lbs.  That amount is a combination of the full cryogenic storage vessel and the maximum number of receptacles onsite and in the full state at the same time.  This max includes seven jumbo tube trailers (140,000scf), four smaller tube trailers (48,000scf), in addition to five hundred size 300 cylinders (261scf).\n\n\n\n"
