The plant prevention program complies with all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Act's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program, (PSM) 29 CFR-1910-119, of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The OSHA program is similar to the EPA's RMP prevention program and EPA emergency response program.\nClean Harbors provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and RMP safety and prevention programs as outlined in our Employee Participation policy and procedure.  Clean Harbors also provides a variety of technical documents beyond the RMP and PSM-required policies and procedures.   The documents are used to maintain safe operation of the processes and include chemical handling instructions. \n1.1.    PREDICTIVE FILING (A) (1)\nThe plant is a treatment storage and disposal site that uses incineration for treatment (destruction) of the hazardous waste streams we are permitted to treat.  Because of the nature of this operation we use predictive filing since there is a potential for"

      "SummaryText": " the chemicals described below to be present at the plant. \nThese chemicals will occasionally be stored at the facility in quantities exceeding the threshold planning quantities. \nAll potential HHCs and their RMP maximum intended inventory are listed below in Section #2.  An evaluation of all the PSM and RMP chemicals on site is determined on a daily basis. The daily evaluation is a conservative estimate of the quantity of each chemical.  It's based on the maximum amount of that chemical in each waste stream.  Cooperating local response agencies are informed of the complete predictive RMP list and upon request, the actual facility inventories are provided.  \n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nClean Harbors has a management system in place which is led by the plant General Manager.  The Clean Harbors Safety Manager and Compliance Manager oversee the execution and on-going implementation of the RMP as well as the like PSM elements.  This program, along with other plant-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information and a copy is attached to this RMP*eSubmital.\n1.3.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nClean Harbors maintains policies, procedures, systems and staff that are an integral part of our prevention program.  These are applied to each process in our plant operations.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained by the Clean Harbors Treatment Plant Document Management System (DMS).\n\n2.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED (B)  \nClean Harbors operates a treatment storage and disposal hazardous waste incinerator system for the destruction of liquid and solid waste products.  \n2.1.

The Clean Harbors, Deer Park, Treatment Storage and Disposal Plant employs 267 full-time employees.\n\n3.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\nThe Clean Harbors accidental release prevention program is based on Good Engineering Practices, OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM/RMP program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall Clean Harbors division wide program and the Clean Harbors Treatment Plant site-specific program.  This is coordinated with the Harris County, Deer Park LEPC, the County Fire/Rescue Department (including the HazMat Team).\n3.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\nClean Harbors has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.  Also a chemical profile is required for each waste stream that is received at the facility.  This profile lists the maximum concentration of each constituent.  The profile is used in the daily evaluation of the quantity of all PSM and RMP chemicals on site.\nOur document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all PSM/RMP operations on site.\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used.\nRefresher training is conducted annually.\nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \nIncident investigations of accidents and near-miss inci"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY(G)\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the Process Hazards Analysis conducted in September 2010 using the HazOp method.  Other recommended actions have recently been completed based on the 2009 PHA and compliance audit as directed by the RMP program to meet requirements and make the plant safer.  The 2010 PHA recommended actions include 28 action items.  These have now been evaluated and are in the process of being resolved as required.  An internal compliance audit was conducted in 2009 of the PSM and RMP program.  Key safety action items were completed.  See \"Update\" Section 6 of the Audit Report.  \nClean Harbors continually develops new and reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the Clean Harbors plant management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the hazardous waste chemical operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of any hazardous chemicals including all RMP HHCs.\n  \n7.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n(Note:  This section is not required.  However, on overview of our hazard assessment follows, minus the results that are documented in our PSI.)\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the plant, environment and the public. For each RMP chemical, the distance to each endpoint concentration of each toxic would travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population within the radius endpoint that could be affected by a release of highly hazardous chemical was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the highly hazardous chemical released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA specified endpoint for highly hazardous chemical is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n7.1.
