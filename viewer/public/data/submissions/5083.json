In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements, the AC HUMKO Risk Management Program document, which is summarized by this plan, describes the following components of a RMP:\n\n- A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and off-site impacts of worst-case and alternate release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n\n- A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving regulated substances.\n\n- An emergency action plan to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n\n- An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management system.\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with applicable regulations for the on-site refrigeration process covered by RMP regulations.\n\nThe subject ACH facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature in food manufacturing operations.  \n\nThe refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia at a stationary source in amounts greater that the RMP and OSHA PSM threshold of 10,000 pounds and a catastrophic release of this substance could impact public receptors.  Therefore, the subject facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving ammonia within the past 5-years.\n\nAC HUMKOs Emergency Response Program was developed in compliance with RMP regulatory requirements cited in 40 CFR 68.90(b)(1) and (3), and the subject facility is a non-responding facility.\n\nThe AC HUMKO Ammonia Emergency Response Program limits employees to"
