Modeling was performed using the software program RMP*Comp version 1.06.  RMP*Comp was developed by the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA.\n\nA map showing the radius of concern for both the worse case and alternate case scenarios is provided for each plant.  The smaller radius shown represents the alternate case scenario.  Maps were created using MARPLOT\u0019 software which also posts locations of various receptors that are located with the radius of concern.  LANDVIEW\u0019 software was then used to generate census data for the areas within each radius of concern.\n\nThe worst case scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the chlorine holding tank due to corrosion, impacts, or structural failure.  The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of 10 minutes.\n\n\tWorst case distance to toxic endpoint for 2,000 pound chlorine release  = 1.3 miles\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine under the worst case scenario is as follows:\n\n\tAlternate case distance to toxic endpoint for 92 pound chlorine release  = 0.1 miles\n\nSid Copeland, Superintendent at the City of Louisville Water Treatment Plants (North and South Plants) is a qualified individual with overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RMP.  He has the authority to commit resources required to implement the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant has developed a RMP accident prevention program (including HAZOP studies for chlorine) from the existing maintenance program and is in compliance with the RMP requirements for Program 2. \n\nThe City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant is a non-responding facility and emergency responses permissible by City of Louisville Water Treatment Facilities"
