The Facility Policy\n\nThe owner, management, and employees of Archer Grain Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information. \n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale\n          to farmers. \n\n       - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application       \n         and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. \n\n       - The maximum quantity stored would be 52,000  pound in our one 12,000 gallon     \n          storage tank. \n\n3. The worse-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario. \n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a \na storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.79 miles. \n      \nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .69 miles. \n\n4. The accidental release prevention program. \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the"

The Five-year Accident History. \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: \n    - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;   \n      nor\n\n    - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering  \n             in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n6. The emergency response program. \n\n- The facility has: \n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community \nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n            \nc. a written response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29\nCFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \n\nd. employees have completed OSHA required 10 hours of safety training for the \nindustry. \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations \nAre performed at assess the maintenance of safe conditions.
