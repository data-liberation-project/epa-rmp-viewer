Chlorine is the only regulated substance subject to the CRF 40 Part 68.\r\n\r\nThe company has in place annual mandatory chlorine safety training for all employees who work at the plant.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, specific training is required in all aspects of the operation of the chlorine process for those who operate the process. Training in maintenance and repair of the chlorine process equipment is conducted with all employees who are required to maintain and repair any part of the system.\r\n\r\nDecatur Utilities has developed a Chlorine Emergency Response Program to fulfill the requirements of OSHA Part 1910.38. The emergency response program is coordinated with the local and state emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 68.155 Section B\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant has two stationary sources, one capable of holding 24 one-ton containers of chlorine and the other capable of holding 12 one-ton containers of chlorine. In process 1, the maximum of 48,000 pounds of chlorine gas may be stored"

      "SummaryText": ".  In process 2, a maximum of 24,000 pounds of chlorine gas may be stored. The covered processes consist of piping, as per Chlorine Institute pamphlet 6, Piping Systems for Dry Chlorine, and chlorine injection equipment specifically designed for the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 68.155 Section C\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nDecatur Utilities has used release scenarios for both worst case and alternative releases from, The Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, sponsored jointly by The American Water Works Association Research Foundation and The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development, and published by AWWA in 1998*. Additionally, the rate of release and endpoints corresponding to the above scenarios were derived from EPA CEPP, RMP Series, Risk Management for Wastewater Treatment Plants.** \r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThis scenario was modeled as a direct release over a 10 minute period, as required by the regulations. It involves catastrophic failure of a one ton container due to impact, corrosion, or construction defect. The entire contents of a full container, 2,000 pounds, is released over a ten minute period at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.* The toxic endpoint was modeled as 1.3 mile radius in all directions from the point of release.** The affected population was estimated at 910.***\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThis scenario assumes release of chlorine gas through 20 feet of 1 inch schedule 80 pipe due to complete failure of the pipe. The scenario assumes that the pressure in the pipe is approximately 97.5 pounds per square inch, which is the vapor pressure of chlorine at 77 degrees F. It also assumes that the release is limited by the pipe dimensions and not by any valve or opening upstream of the release. The release duration is 60 minutes at an average release rate of 72 lb/min. The total release is 4,320 pounds with a toxic endpoint of 0.8 miles. The pop"

The management system clearly delineates accountability and responsibility of specific elements of the program to various RMP management groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCurrent process safety information is available to all operators of the covered process and maintenance employees in accordance with CRF 40 Part 68.48. Safety information includes current MSDS sheets, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, and flows, process equipment and material specifications, safe operating procedures and codes and standards used in the design and construction of the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA hazard analysis has been performed for the program II covered processes. A checklist was used based on The Chlorine Institute's, The Chlorine manual, pamphlet 1 6th edition, January 1997. Causes of potential accidental release scenarios were investigated and safeguards in place to prevent a release. The process hazard analysis was documented and will be updated every five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nProcess operating procedures were reviewed, documented, and refresher training conducted with all plant operators and maintenance employees. Operating procedures cover all phases of process operations including system startup, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following an emergency shutdown. Process limits were reviewed and documented. Emergency first aid care for chlorine exposures are outlined and included in training.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nChlorine safety training and Red Cross first aid and CPR training is mandatory for all plant employees and is conducted annually.
