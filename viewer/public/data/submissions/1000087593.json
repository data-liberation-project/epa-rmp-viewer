Propane is the Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) regulated chemical stored at the terminal which exceeds a threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \r\nThe Inland Terminal is a secured facility which is manned Monday to Friday 0700-1600. Only approved truck drivers/companies are allowed 24 hours access to the facility for tank truck filling operations. The terminal is regulated as a Program Level 3, CAP facility.  General accidental release prevention programs and propane-specific release prevention steps incorporated for the covered process include the following:\r\n- The terminal is a fully fenced facility, with access gates to limit entry to authorized personnel only\r\n- Operating procedures have been developed and implemented for operations performed by terminal operators\r\n- The Manager IFTI Operations and terminal employees are provided with initial and refresher training in accordance with the Na"
