In concert with the Coshocton Fire Department and the Emergency Management Director, a NFPA Fire Safety Analysis has been conducted.   \n\n4) The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at Wiley Companies in the last 5 years.\n\n5) The Emergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Wiley Companies has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.  Wiley Companies also keeps an Integrated Contingency Plan that is sent to local emergency responders. All facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency action plan, and Wiley Companies policy requires that emergency drills be conducted at least annually. Wiley Companies employees will not respond to an emergency as the organization does not have trained first responders. In the event of an emergency release from the Acetaldehyde System with a possible offsite consequence, the city of Coshocton Fire Department will be notified by calling 911. The Coshocton Fire Department has been informed of the storage of Acetaldehyde and location of Acetaldehyde system. The Coshocton Fire Department conducts an annual site walkthrough. The Acetaldehyde system has its own emergency shutdown devices. Part of the shutdown procedure involves disconnecting the electrical supply to the facility, shutting the facility natural gas supply and performing the emergency shutdown.\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nWiley Companies is committed to the continual improvement of its safety, health and environmental programs. Below are some of the major steps we will be considering to improve safety at our facility over the coming year.  \n\nPlanned Changes:\n1.
