      "SummaryText": "The Tennessee-American Water Company Citico Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to customers in the area of Chattanooga Tennessee and northwestern Georgia. To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.\n\nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in shipping containers. Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.\n\nTennessee-American Water Company is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nTennessee-American Water Company has completed an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case release scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or container as a gas in ten-minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance. \n\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the \"endpoint\" concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair"

      "SummaryText": " an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The endpoint (ERPG-2 value) established for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nFor the hilly/urban setting of the Chattanooga region, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration for the worst-case release extends offsite into residential and commercial areas.  RMP*COMP offsite consequence analysis software developed by the EPA was used to estimate the offsite impacts.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of chlorine transport containers (they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at chlorine suppliers and the Citico Plant.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario was selected as the first alternative release scenario. This scenario assumes that the unloading connection to a transport container is completely severed, resulting in a vapor release within the chlorine storage room, and the release containment scrubber fails to automatically operate to contain the release. The mitigating affects of the building were considered by applying a factor of 0.55 to the release rate for an unmitigated release from this source. This means that the chemical release rate from the building is 55% of the release rate from the source. This factor is recommended for modeling the effects of building mitigation in the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and is used by EPA's RMP*COMP software.\n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history su"

As with the worst-case scenario, actual distances and directions vary with terrain and weather conditions.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario includes the same source of release, but assumes that the release containment scrubber automatically operates to contain the release when activated by the chlorine detector alarm. The scrubber is designed to have a stack concentration of 15 parts per million of chlorine or less which results in a release to the outside air of less than 3 grams per minute. This release was modeled using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software and found to be below the endpoint concentration both onsite and offsite. The release rate and impact distances entered in RMP*Submit are higher than actually estimated because of the limitations of the software.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Citico Plant maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine. The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTennessee-American Water Company is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Water Quality Superintendent has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.

The release was very small, probably less than one pound, and only affected an operator that was testing for leaks. There was no potential for offsite effects because of the small size of the release and its capture and treatment by the containment scrubber.

The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization. We will also be assessing further safety enhancements to the facility over the next few years.\n \nPlanned changes to improve safety\n \nWe will be taking a variety of additional steps in the future to enhance the safety of our operation and further reduce the potential for accidental release. These include upgrades of our preventive maintenance program on the containment scrubber system, minor modifications to the chlorination facilities and modifying our chlorine scrubber stack so it discharges through the roof of the Pre-Chemical Building.  This modification will improve discharge of the scrubber and ensure that operators can easily access the scrubber equipment to ensure proper operation in the event of a release.  We will also be assessing further safety enhancements to the facility on an ongoing basis over the next few years."
