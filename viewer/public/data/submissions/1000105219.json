The prevention program covers both Alternative Fuels and Secondary Raw Materials (AFR) Processes; direct burn and blended burn. Geocycle has prepared this plan and submitted a predictive RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.  This summary includes a brief description of the key elements of our Level 2 program.\n\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\nGeocycle's prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Level 2 Prevention Program.  Key polices which are implemented includes MSHA standards:\n1.1.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A) (1)\nGeocycle has a management system that is led by the Facility Manager and supporting staff.  This is depicted in an organization chart which is attached.\n1.2.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2 (A) (2)\nGeocycle maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of our prevention program.

The safety information assists in the understanding of the safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, and the limitations placed on the operations and the adopted codes and standards.  \nGeocycle receives hazardous waste, and uses a detailed chemical analysis and physical property analysis to define each waste stream.  There are no SDSs for hazardous waste.  However, a SDS of the individual components is used as a guide.  Also the information contained on the waste chemicals Safety Information Sheet is reviewed and updated on a periodic basis for completeness and accuracy.  The maximum intended inventory for each RMP Toxic Chemical is listed in the List of Chemicals in the RMP.  \nThe bulk containers used for delivering the waste fuel containing the RMP compounds are DOT-specification containers and are required to be tested periodically for tightness and adequacy for carrying hazardous materials.  \nDocumentation of the safety and design information on the typical process equipment, along with the corresponding design codes, is maintained in the plant's current RCRA Permit Ap"
