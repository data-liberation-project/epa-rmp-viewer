The primary products produced at St. Gabriel are chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic). Chlorine is used in the purification and sanitation of drinking water, hospital sanitation, swimming pool treatment, and laundry bleach. Chlorine is a basic building block chemical used in the production of industrial chemicals and in the construction industry. In addition, more than 85% of pharmaceuticals are derived from chlorine derivatives. Sodium hydroxide is used in the production of products as diverse as soap, latex paint, rayon, and nylon clothing.\n\n\n\nOlin's environmental, safety, and health policies empha the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. Olin has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years. One part of these programs is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nChlorine is the only chemical that the RMP regulation pertains to at the facility. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds. Olin is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, as well as Program 3 of EPA's RMP Rule. Olin complies with the regulation and, in addition, has implemented several elements of the RMP in non-RMP process areas. Olin was the first OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) St"

In addition, Olin has received the EPA's Environmental Excellence Award from the State of Louisiana multiple times. Facility personnel participate in monthly communication meetings with the local Community Advisor Panel (CAP) to discuss and explain any facility safety and environmental issues that could potentially affect the community.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions. While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning. The release duration for this scenario is ten minutes with an estimated quantity released of 800,000 lbs. The EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the analysis. The computer-generated model for the largest chlorine tank at the facility results in a planning zone of 25 miles. Based on this analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nAdditional worst case scenarios were analyzed at the above ground sections of the chlorine pipeline. Each analysis estimated 240 lbs of chlorine gas liquefied by pressure being released over a 10 minute period. EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the analysis. Based on this analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nFacilities must also prepare an alternative scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on facility operations. The alternative scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weather conditions. The alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst case scenario. Several alternative scenarios we"

For planning purposes only, it is assumed that the safety check valve on the rail car does not engage. Scenario 1 analyzed a release of 243 lbs over 0.2 minutes. The EPA's RMP*Comp software was used in this analysis. The computer-generated model for this release results in a possible impact of up to 1.3 miles. There are public and environmental receptors that would be affected by this alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nScenarios 2 and 3 analyzed a release at a flange at two separate above ground sections of the chlorine pipeline. Each scenario released 1 lb/min for a period of four hours. The release would then trigger surrounding monitors. EPA's RMP*Comp software was also used in the analyses. There were no public receptors that would be affected by these alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOlin has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, to Olin employees, and to the preservation of the environment. One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Olin utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. In conjunction with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the facility has the ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive accidental release preve"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. Critical information on chlorine properties, chlorine production techniques, and chlorine handling is also made readily available to facility personnel through MSDS, along with current drawings, and comprehensive operating procedures. \n\n\n\nOlin also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment specifications and vendor manufacturing information is used for equipment and system designs. Additionally, the Chlorine Institute provides information and guidelines in the form of regularly updated technical pamphlets. This information is used while conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) and is the basis for developing our operating procedures and chemical process systems.

The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the chlorine processes are identified and controlled. PHAs are performed on an established schedule for RMP/PSM processes. A trained team with a certified PHA Leader performs PHA's on the RMP process and other process nodes not regulated by the standard. The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. The recommendations are then prioritized and implemented accordingly. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is completed in a timely manner. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Safety Manager as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the Olin operating procedures discuss consequences of deviating from the safe limits and provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Changes to operating procedures are tracked through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Olin has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Olin operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nOlin has a documented inspection program that enhances the integrity of critical equipment and systems at the facility. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). \n\nRecommendations from equipment inspections are then prioritized and implemented accordin"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Olin incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nOlin has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. Written procedures are in place to ensure that all process changes at the facility undergo several levels of review at the planning stage. The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Systems are also in place to assure that communications of the changes will be made to all affected personnel before changes are implemented. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.  \n\n\n\nPre Start Up Reviews\n\nOlin conducts a pre-startup safety review for any systems that require a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind). The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. T"

The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Olin periodically conducts audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. These audits are led by a third party contractor with assistance by Olin employees as required. The findings are forwarded to Olin management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nOlin promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Olin management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility personnel who could be affected by the findings. The facility embraces the Total Incident Reporting System to assure that all potential incidents are captured and addressed in a timely manner. Incident investigation reports are r"

Operators, maintenance technicians, and engineers, as well as supervisors and managers participate fully in Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Studies, procedure development, trainings, and incident investigations. A broad range of facility personnel also make up the safety committee and participate in a wide range of safety related activities.\n\n\n\nHot Work & Work Permits\n\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained in the EHS department. The plant has implemented other work permits to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\n\n\n\nContractor Safety\n\nOlin uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, Olin has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Olin personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. The contractor safety program places stringent qualification requirements on contracting firms before entering into the facility to perform work. Contractors provide training documentation of their employees that meet or exceed the requirement of the job scope. Contactors participate in an industry supported 24-hour safety certification and then site specific orientation before being permitted to work in the facility.  Contrac"

Contractor performance evaluations can be found in purchasing files.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOlin maintains a comprehensive written Emergency Action Plan to protect the safety of workers and the public, as well as, the environment. The plan provides for 24 hour/day, 365 day/year response capabilities. The manual includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Facility responders are trained and qualified on the proper response techniques for the chemicals associated with the facility and are equipped with the necessary equipment to perform critical response procedures.\n\nAs part of the ongoing training program for responders, routine drills are conducted. These include both tabletop planning sessions, as well as, full field responses to simulated incidents at the facility. Additionally, Olin conducts joint drills with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness and works closely with that office to coordinate emergency response actions. Olin is also an active member of the Geismar Area Mutual Aid group, which provides equipment resources for emergency response from other area facilities.\n\nThe facility is equipped with a facility-wide alarm system.

Current emergency phone numbers are maintained in the control room of the facility and in the Emergency Action Plan, which is immediately available in several critical areas of the plant so that timely notifications can be made.\n\nThe facility-wide chlorine monitoring network has monitors stationed at key locations throughout the facility. These monitors can detect chlorine at low concentrations. Operations personnel monitor the real-time readings from the chlorine sensors and will respond immediately to any detection. Additionally, the facility utilizes a computer modeling system that can help to plan potential scenarios and develop appropriate responses.\n\n\n\nTrade Secrets\n\nOlin operates under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 32518 (Other Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing).  The facility produces chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic). There are currently no chemicals or components at the facility that carry the Trade Secret label.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR HISTORY\n\nOlin is committed to minimizing potential risks to the public, employees and environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there have been two releases of a regulated substance from a regulated process that have occurred and have resulted in injuries. In August 2008, a gas release occurred for a period of 32 minutes which resulted in 22 lbs being released and 2 injuries. In March 2009, another gas release occurred over 5 minutes which resulted in 2lbs of chlorine gas being released and 1 injury. As a result of these incidents, changes were introduced to decrease the probability of the incident reoccurring. If another incident would occur, as per the procedure, a thorough investigation would be initiated to determine the causes of the incident. In addition, the incidents would be reported to the appro"
