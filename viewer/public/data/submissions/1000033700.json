      "SummaryText": "2644  LDEQ Facility ID Number\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nPioneer Americas, LLC d/b/a Olin Chlor Alkali (Olin) St. Gabriel facility occupies approximately 60 acres of a 300-acre tract located along Highway 75 (River Road), approximately 0.5 miles south of St. Gabriel, Iberville Parish, Louisiana. The primary products produced at St. Gabriel are chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic). Chlorine is used in the purification and sanitation of drinking water, hospital sanitation, swimming pool treatment, and laundry bleach. Chlorine is a basic building block chemical used in the production of industrial chemicals and in the construction industry. In addition, more than 85% of pharmaceuticals are derived from chlorine derivatives. Sodium hydroxide is used in the production of products as diverse as soap, latex paint, rayon, and nylon clothing.\r\n\r\nOlin's environmental, safety, and health policies empha the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. Olin has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years.

Facility personnel participate in monthly communication meetings with the local Community Advisor Panel (CAP) to discuss and explain any facility safety and environmental issues that could potentially affect the community.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nThe EPA has defined the worst case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions. While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning. The release duration for this scenario is ten minutes with an estimated quantity released of 800,000 lbs. The EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the analysis. The computer-generated model for the largest chlorine tank at the facility results in a planning zone of 25 miles. Based on this analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nAdditional worst case scenarios were analyzed at the above ground sections of the chlorine pipeline. Each analysis estimated 240 lbs of chlorine gas liquefied by pressure being released over a 10 minute period. EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the analysis. Based on this analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nFacilities must also prepare an alternative scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on facility operations. The alternative scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weather conditions.

The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and are documented and retained. The final resolution of the recommendations is also documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Safety Manager as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the Olin operating procedures discuss consequences of deviating from the safe limits and provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Changes to operating procedures are tracked through the management of change (MOC) process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Olin has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.
