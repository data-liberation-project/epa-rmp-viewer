Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and mixing of anhydrous ammonia, which is used for manufacturing 10-34-0 fertilizer. The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility and each storage vessel has been shared with the Perkins County LEPC and the local response agencies.  The maximum fill level of each tank and rail car is 85% of the total tank capacity.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the three stationary tanks and two railcars are located at the facility and are at the maximum fill level of 85%.    \n\nUp to three (3) times per year, 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.

After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0).\n\nSituated above the holding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pulls air up the tower off of the holding pool.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down packing (i.e., Pall Rings) back down to the holding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaporates and cools the solution.\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization, flows back to the holding pool and some of the solution flows to a storage tank.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one 80-ton railcar.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 160,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the rail car is not filled more than 85% full.

There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process. \n\n1) Process Safety Information:  The process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures for operating the process equipment are periodically reviewed by management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the process equipment are maintained and updated. \n\n2) Process Hazard Analysis:  Management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the process.  The process hazard analysis reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the process hazard analysis reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n3) Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures for the process are readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  The operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary so that they reflect current practices and changes to the process or equipment. \n\n4) Training:  All operators of the proce"

Initial training consists of classroom type instruction that covers health and safety hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n5) Mechanical Integrity:  A written mechanical integrity program is used to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.  Each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment is trained in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks so that the employee can perform the tasks in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed on process equipment following recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections and tests on process equipment is consistent with applicable good engineering practices.  Documentation of each inspection and test on process equipment is maintained in the appropriate format.  Deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken for safe operation.  Appropriate checks and inspections are performed so that equipment is installed properly and consistent with design specifications and manufacture's instructions.\n                                                                                     \n6) Management of Change:  Written procedures are used to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n7) Pre-Startup Review:  When modification to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and, training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\n\n8) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \n\n9) Incident Investigation:  Management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\n10) Employee Participation: A written plan of action regarding employee participation is readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.

Welding/fabrication and electrical work is completed by experienced personnel.   \n\n12) Contractors:  If a contractor is needed to perform work on process equipment, information regarding the safety performance of the contractor is obtained and evaluated.  Before access to process equipment is given to a contractor, the protocol is to inform the contractor about potential hazards associated with the process, entrance and exit control  and emergency response activities.  Additionally, the contractor must act responsibly.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.
