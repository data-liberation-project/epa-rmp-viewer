This objective will never be compromised and is the most basic obligation of all personnel at the plant. In fulfilling this commitment, we ensure that all Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety Policies and Principles are strictly followed. \n\n\n\nThe Kankakee site is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kankakee County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n \n\nThe plant's Emergency Response Plan is based upon a combination of governmental and company requirements. Local response capabilities have been reviewed to ensure a coordinated response with all appropriate agencies. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire and police departments, governmental agencies, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n \n\nKankakee Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\n \n\nA? The primary purpose of the Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant is to produce emulsions for paper coating and painting industry.  One of the raw materials used for the production of these emulsio"

The finished product leaving the plant contains very low concentrations of this chemical, such that they no longer present a toxicity hazard.\n\nB? Vinyl Acetate is transported to the plant in both railcar and truck, the primary source of supply being railcar. Once received in the plant, the Vinyl Acetate is transferred to an onsite 150,000 gallon above-ground  storage tank. The polymer manufacturing process has the necessary equipment for the safe unloading of railcars into the storage tank and transferring into the process vessels.\n\nC? Railcars are sometimes stored on site, and remain for a short time period until the Vinyl Acetate is transferred to the onsite 150,000 gallon above-ground  storage tank mentioned above. The polymer manufacturing process inventory quantity is based on the maximum number of railcars predicted to be stored on site at any one given time, plus the maximum quantity of the storage tank process delivery system. (NOTE: The quantity stated is a predictive estimate and the actual rail car storage is normally less)\n\nD. Vinyl Acetate monomer may be present in process piping and process vessels for any given amount of time, depending on batch process scheduling and the matrix of batches scheduled on specific reactor trains. This is used to calculate the predictive estimate of maximum Vinyl Acetate storage.  \n\nE. Access to the  Dow Inc. Kankakee Plant is restricted to authorized employees, and authorized contractors.  All persons seeking to enter the plant are screened and required to undergo training in the plant safety rules prior to entry.\n\n   \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n \n\nThe Dow Chemical Kankakee Plant Program's comply with OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP Rules, as well as with all applicable governmental codes and regulations.

A comprehensive training and testing program has been developed for all plant employees to ensure that all equipment is operated in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\n\nThe site has reviewed the loss prevention principals provided by the Dow Chemical Company and has completed a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in the bulk monomer storage area to validate the existing operations and identify additional improvement opportunities.\n\n\n\nIncluded in the Kankakee Plant's Emergency Response Program are trained Incipient Fire Responders, trained Technician Level HAZMAT Responders, trained Industrial Medical Responders, trained Incident Commanders, onsite fire and spill response foam capability, onsite HAZMAT response equipment, fixed water spray fire protection systems, strategically located chemical sensors, onsite fire water containment basin(s), plant notification systems including alarms, phones, and radios, and neighbor/community notification procedures.
