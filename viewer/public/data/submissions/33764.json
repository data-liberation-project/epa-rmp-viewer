      "SummaryText": "The Supervalu - Green Bay Distribution Center is food products warehousing and distribution to client grocery stores and distribution centers.  This building complex includes a Perishable Warehouse with an ammonia refrigeration system which contains over 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The closed ammonia refrigeration system at the Perishable Warehouse contains a maximum intended inventory of 18,000 pounds.  The facility is located in a urban setting in the industrial region of Green Bay, Wisconsin.  The facility has an active Process Safety Management Program.  Access to the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel.  Most of the service work is done by a service contractor.  The majority of the distribution piping and key shutoff valves have been relocated to the roof.  The significant investment associated with this undertaking is an example of the commitment of management to identifying critical safety control points and improving the process accordingly.\n\nAn OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program is in place a the Perishable Warehouse.  Under that program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently.  Operating condidtions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset.  The readily-distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the constantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing piping and equipment is located that even the slightest release may have occurred.  Most piping and all key shutoff valves are located on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions.  Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment from areas of safety, such as the maintenance and compressor room areas, were installed many years ago.  The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans, and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area.\n\nAs a testimony to the overall safe"

      "SummaryText": "ty of the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years which have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any off-site consequences.\n\nThe Brown County LEPC has included the Supervalu facility in the community emergency plan for many years.  Every year, the LEPC contacts the facility representatives for an update of plan elements.  The adjoining Ashwaubenon Fire Department maintains a successful HAZMAT squad that is constantly available to provide resources in the event of an accidental release.  Supervalu - Green Bay has adopted the Integrated Contigency Plan format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its on-site Emergency Action and Response Plan.  Under this plan emergency training and practice drills are frequent and cover a multitude of potential scenarios.  Four key managers become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammoni releases, and their duties are as follows: (a) coordination of and direction to on-site and external emergency responders; (b) notification of agencies and on-site safety and security; (c) protection and continuation of business operations and employee welfare; and (d) communication with the public as necessary.\n\nSupervalu - Green Bay continues to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it. At this current time, Supervalu is continuing the relocation of ammonia piping to the roof in order to improve safety and minimize risks."
