      "SummaryText": "The Buda Waste Water Treatment Plant (BWWTP) is owned by the City of Buda, Texas and operated by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA).  The plant is located in Hays County, Texas at 575 County Road 236, approximately one (1) mile north of Main Street.  Gas chlorine is the only hazardous chemical on site with a maximum quantity of 8,000 pounds or four (4) one ton containers.  Only two containers are set-up for use at any given time, with only one container actually having chlorine drawn from it for disinfection of the wastewater.  The gas is drawn off the container under a vacuum.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a valve located on the chlorine container automatically closes, stopping flow of the chorine gas and thus reducing the chance of a chlorine release.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for chlorine involves a release of 200 pounds per minute for 10 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  Radius of impact within the 3.0-mile rural setting could include a population of 10,374 persons, two municipalities, two churches, two parks or recreational facilities, and a major retail center.   No hospitals, major industrial buildings, or federally designated environmental receptors are located in the impacted area.\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios were modeled.  Alternative A involves a \u00bc\u00bf hole in the chlorine container.  Given a release rate of 150 lbs./min for 13 minutes, 2000 pounds of chlorine could be released impacting a radius of 0.6 miles.  Within this area are a population of 410 persons, one park, and one City maintenance facility.\n\nAlternative release scenario B involves a 1/16\u00bf hole in the container or the equivalent leak from a valve gasket.  Radius of impact is 0.2 miles with 300 pounds released during the course of 30 minutes.  There are no receptors located within the area impacted other than the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe probability of other scenarios are very low since breaks or leaks in the gas lines would be between the source"

      "SummaryText": "of vacuum and the vacuum actuated valve that automatically closes upon loss of vacuum.  Any break sufficient to release chlorine gas would stop the vacuum.\n\nThe chlorine system is fully contained within a sealed building equipped with a mechanical chlorine gas scrubber system actuated by gas detection equipment.  This structure further reduces the likely-hood of a release of chlorine gas from the site, but has been discounted in developing the worst-case and alternative case scenarios.\n\nGBRA has recognized the need for care in handling chlorine. Chlorine handling has been addressed in the GBRA Safety Manual, the job safety analysis, the emergency operations plan, the preventive maintenance program, and the annual safety audit. Training is conducted annually with advanced training occurring every two years. Training is conducted on practice containers purchased for that function. Leak detection systems are located inside the chlorine storage building that activates an alarm at the point of a leak and activates the scrubber unit.\n\nOperations personnel either have completed or will complete a Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service Hazardous Release Technician course along with in-house training in use of SCBA and chlorine handling.  There have been no releases of chlorine in the operating history of the Buda WWTP, but in the event an incident does occur, the Buda Fire Department will be notified and will serve as primary responder, with GBRA personnel assisting as needed.  This site has been offered to the Buda Fire Department and Hays County Hazardous Materials Response Team for future training and drills."
