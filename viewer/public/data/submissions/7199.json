The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nAt the Lackawanna Sewage Treatment Plant - Erie County Sewer District No. 6 (ECSD #6), personnel are continually concerned with the safety of employees, the public, and the environment.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program we have covers areas including operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at this facility.  To prevent possible releases of regulated substances, appropriate controls and techniques are used.  If such a release does occur, personnel at ECSD #6, through the Division of Sewerage Management (DSM), are fully coordinated with the Erie County Department of Emergency Services and the Lackawanna Fire Department, whom all commit highly trained emergency response crews to help control and ease the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (primary activities, use of regulated substances, & quantities handled or stored)\n\n7 This facility's primary activity involves the treatment of wastewater at a Sewage Treatment Plant.  Presently, there is one (1) regulated toxic substance above threshold quantity at this facility, which is Chlorine (Cl2).  \n\n7 Chlorine is used for the disinfection of wastewater, primarily to destroy and/or deactivate pathogenic organisms.\n\n7 The maximum inventory of Chlorine at this facility is 12,000 lbs., which is broken down into six (6) one-ton (2,000 lb.) containers.  There are two (2) containers on each of the two (2) scales, and the remaining two (2) containers on the floor, with only one (1) container in use at any given time.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario (include scenario & distance to endpoint).\n\nThe ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) modeling program, version 5.2.1, was used to"

      "SummaryText": " attain the required offsite consequence analysis for this facility.  The following provides a summary of the Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios:\n\nThe WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a disastrous release from one of the chlorine containers and assumed to be a puncture at the bottom of the container.  In this particular scenario, 2,000 lbs. (the entire mass of the container) of Chlorine was released and resulted in a liquid spill, with vaporization, over a ten (10) minute span.  Under worst case weather conditions being Class F atmospheric stability, 250C (770F), 50% humidity, no cloud cover, and 1.5 m/s (3.35 mph) windspeed, the maximum threat zone distance for a level of concentration (LOC) of 0.0087 mg/L is 2.9 miles.\n \nThe ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO for Chlorine involves a release from a single chlorine container and assumed to be a failure at the transfer hose, due to over pressurization or human error.  In this scenario, 800 lbs. of Chlorine will be released in a gaseous form over a six (6) minute span.  The contents that remain in the tank after the pressurized gas is released will be of liquid chlorine.  This liquid will be at a level lower than the release point and therefore, the contents would remain in the tank.  Under neutral weather conditions (taken from Local Climatological Data 1995-1997 for Buffalo, NY) being Class D stability, 47.40F (8.560C), 73% humidity, 5/10 cloud cover, and 10.3 mph (4.61 m/s) windspeed, the maximum threat zone distance for a level of concentration (LOC) of 0.0087 mg/L is 2.0 miles.\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAt the Lackawanna Sewage Treatment Plant - Erie County Sewer District No. 6 (ECSD #6), personnel have taken all the steps needed to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, found in 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility is subject to the OSHA PSM and EPCRA section 302 standards.  A brief descr"

The methodology used to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process in this analysis is What If/Checklist.  The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated and revalidated every five (5) years.  Any changes resulting from the hazard analysis are completed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTo safely conduct activities involved within the process, Lackawanna Sewage Treatment Plant - ECSD #6 personnel maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address each operating phase including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after an emergency shutdown.  Each year, the Chief Wastewater Treatment Plant Operator reviews the operating procedures and certifies in the annual report that all current operating practices are reflected.  In addition, all operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the process.\n\nTraining\nThis facility has an extensive training program in place to ensure that employees involved with the processes are completely knowledgeable about the operating procedures and hazards associated with them.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary, to each employee involved with the processes.  Currently, training is ongoing throughout the year in many areas.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nAt the Lackawanna Sewage Treatment Plant - ECSD #6, personnel carry out routine maintenance checks, inspections, and testing on all process equipment to ensure proper fun"
