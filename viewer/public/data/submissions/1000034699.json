The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility has the capability to receive anhydrous ammonia by railcar or commercial tanker truck.  If by railcar, the railcar is temporarily staged on the Facilities rail spur so that trained Facility personnel can transfer the anhydrous ammonia to the onsite stationary storage tanks (Covered Process 2).  Up to five (5) 34,000-gallon railcars could be staged on the Facility rail spur.  However, it is important to note that the Facility has not received anhydrous ammonia by railcar in more than 8 years.  Due to the fact that the railcar transfer is still connected to the stationary storage tanks, the railcar storage is included in this RMP and RMPr.  Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars to the storage tanks in accordance with the railcar operating procedures that are provided in Attachment G to the RMPr.\n\n\n\nHelena primarily receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. Details related to the Vendor are discussed in Covered Process 2.\n\n",

The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  Storage and process equipment included under this covered process includes (1) 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank and ancillary pump, piping, and valves, (2) 12,000-gallon stationary storage tank and ancillary pump, piping, and valves, and (3) 36 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures that are provided in Attachment G to the RMPr.\n\n\n\nUnder this covered process, Helena receives anhydrous ammonia by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial tanker truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Devol Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Devol Facility located approximately 0.2 miles south of Devol and 6 miles southeast of Grandfield on State Highway 70 and Wichita Street.  The physical address to the Highway 70 and Wichita Street, Devol, OK 73531.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Devol Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Devol Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a 5-Year update.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Devol Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates two (2) covered processes that include Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling (stationary storage tank) of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is primarily transported to the Facility by a Contractor/Vendor via a c"

      "SummaryText": "ommercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) but has the capability to receive anhydrous ammonia by railcar (34,000 gallons).  The Contractor/Vendor that operates the commercial tanker truck performs the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the commercial tanker truck to the (1) 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank and/or a (1) 12,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  If the Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar, Helena personnel performs the transfer of the anhydrous ammonia from the railcar to the stationary storage tanks.  It is important to note that this Facility has not received anhydrous ammonia by railcar in more than 8 years.  However, because the railcar transfer station is connected to the storage tanks, the railcar storage has been included as a covered process at this Facility.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns 36 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the two (2) covered processes that are operated at this Facility.  The covered processes include Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility was the same for both covered processes and assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released over a 10-minute period.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 34,000-gallon railcar that is delivered in the winter months.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was different for each covered process.  The alter"

      "SummaryText": "native scenario for the Railcar Storage assumes a 60-minute release from a Railcar vapor valve that was not completely closed.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 2-minute release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Devol Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Devol Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Devol\n\nFacility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Devol Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Cotton County "
