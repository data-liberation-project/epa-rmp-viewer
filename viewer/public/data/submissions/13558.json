USA (Cutrale) Auburndale facility (the Facility) is located at 602 McKean Street, Auburndale, Polk County, Florida 33823 (see Figure 1-1).  The Facility is a critical part of Cutrale's Florida citrus processing operations.  The Facility's main functions include extracting and blending juice and essences from oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes.  \n\nCutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of Cutrale and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, Cutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, Cutrale has developed this integrated Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan (the Plan).  Among the important components of this Plan are Cutrale's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and Cutrale's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility.  Cutrale has designated its corporate Director of Quality Process and Compliance and the Facility's Director of Auburndale Operations as the individuals with primary responsibility and accountability for seeing that this Plan and its associated components accurately reflect Facility conditions and that it is fully implemented.   \n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Facility is designed to extract juices and essences from locally grown citrus fruits.  These products are either sold to offsite packagers for sale to the public or blended onsite and sold directly to a reseller.  To support these primary functions, t"

These systems are described below:\n\n\nSystem    Description                 Type                 Location\n1              Main                            Two-Stage      Throughout main plant\n2              Essence Tank Farm    Single-Stage    Between bldgs. 37 and 45\n3              Old Tank Farm             Single-Stage    Between bldgs. 36 and 37\n4              New Tank Farm           Single-Stage    Bldg. 56\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems are relatively simple systems typical of those that are common throughout the food processing industry.  The basic technology involves the recirculation of ammonia, with a change in state from liquid to a liquid/gas mixture, then back to a liquid.  \n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Facility in its liquid state and is stored in a high pressure receiver.  From this vessel, the liquid ammonia is pumped to a recirculator or accumulator (different terminology indicating the same vessel, depending on the age of the vessel), then to the individual pieces of cooling equipment, which generally include chillers and/or air handlers serving blast freezers, product storage tanks, and the like.  The warmed, lower pressure, mainly liquid ammonia is then pumped (with some intermediate steps, depending on the system configuration) to a bank of compressors, from which the ammonia is routed to the condensers, which condense the ammonia to a lower temperature and higher pressure.  This flow is then returned to the high pressure receiver previously described.  The main difference between the two-stage and single-stage systems is that in a single-stage system, the ammonia flow is routed through only one set of compressors.  In a two-stage system, the ammonia flows through two sets of compressors in series.  \n\nTo determine the maximum intended ammonia inventory, a complex calculation must be performed to account for the quantity of ammonia in each of the major process vessels operating at their normal le"

This program is documented in this integrated Plan.  This program meets or exceeds all requirements of applicable PSM/RMP regulations.\n\n\n1.4  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn spite of the Facility's aggressive release prevention program, the Facility experienced two significant releases that occurred within a 24 hour period spanning January 8, 1999 and January 9, 1999.  The incidents, which are described briefly below, are discussed in greater detail in Section 5.1 of this Plan.\n\nThe first release occurred during a production changeover at 3:53 p.m. on January 8, 1999.  Due to an operator error, an explosion of an ammonia refrigeration jacket on a process tank occurred resulting in a release of 3,250 pounds of ammonia from the bulk blend tank system over a period of approximately 2 hours and 37 minutes.  Six employees were treated and transported to the hospital.  The plant was evacuated, however, there was no public evacuation and there were no off-site consequences.  An assessment of the total ammonia system was conducted prior to re-start.\n\nThe second release occurred during system start-up at 6:10 a.m. on January 9, 1999.  Due primarily to operator error, a valve was opened allowing pressurized liquid ammonia to enter an abandoned pipe, res"

Three employees were treated and transported to the hospital.  The plant was evacuated, however, there was no public evacuation and there were no off-site consequences.  Contributing causes of the release included the prior Facility owner not properly indicating the pipe on Facility drawings, and the valve not being disabled.\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the City of Auburndale Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nIt is Cutrale's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  These individuals also are trained to respond to a release by stopping the release, thereby assuming a more aggressive role than those trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  The ERP describes the conditions under which Cutrale personnel would attempt to stop a chemical release, as well as the sequence of actions that would be undertaken under those circumstances.  \n\nIt is Cutrale's policy for employees to call the Facility's 24-hour guard in the event of any release emergency.   It is the responsibility of the guard to call 911.  The local Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team has the responsibility to oversee mitigation of  the release conditions.  The Auburndale Fire Department, in conjunction with Cutrale, is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of offsite areas is necessary, and for public notification.\n\n\n1.6 PLANNED"
