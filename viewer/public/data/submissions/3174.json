General accidental release and prevention policy of McCain Foods USA, Inc.\r\n\r\nIn this food product manufacturing facility we handle anhydrous ammonia in a liquid and vapor\r\nstate which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make ammonia a\r\nvaluable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to\r\nprevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal health, the surrounding\r\ncommunity and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state\r\nregulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety\r\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that our personnel\r\nare trained in.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nMcCain Foods USA, 100 West Coleman Street, Rice Lake, Wisconsin is responsible for the\r\nmanufacturing of frozen onion rings.  There are approximately 175 employees at this facility\r\nwhich includes hourly and salary personnel.  The plant manufactures product around the clock,\r\n(7) seven days a week.  McCain Foods is located in an industrial park on the south west side of\r\nRice Lake, Wisconsin.  In addition to our manufacturing facility the industrial park also houses\r\nother manufacturing or business facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the McCain Foods facility is ANHYDROUS\r\nAMMONIA. The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent, distinct odor. \r\nPersons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations,\r\nalthough these levels would not result in any health risks. \r\nRisks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and\r\nthroat. The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and le"

      "SummaryText": "ngth of exposure.   \r\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  It will burn, but only\r\nin a very narrow, high concentration level with a constant ignition source.\r\n\r\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used/stored at the McCain Foods USA facility is\r\n27,810 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant chemical in the\r\nmanufacturing/storage  process. The possible hazards that could lead to an accidental release\r\ninclude, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human\r\nerror, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenarios including administrative and\r\nengineering controls to limit/prevent the release.\r\n\r\n   Worst case release scenario criteria for McCain Foods USA facility:\r\n\r\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\r\nlocated inside the McCain Foods machine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 5,480\r\npounds of liquid ammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity. Although it's maximum\r\ncapacity is 10,960 pounds, this exceeds engineering controls and company policy of only allowing\r\nan 80% level at any time.  \r\n\r\n     Ammonia Quantity:                  5,480 pounds\r\n     Rate of Release:                   548 lbs / min. (10 min. release)\r\n     LOC (Level of Concern):            200 ppm  (EPA ERPG-2)  \r\n     Physical State:                    Gas and/or Liquid\r\n           Type of Area:                     Urban\r\n     Wind Speed:                        1.5 m/sec\r\n     Distance to Endpoint                    2.5 miles\r\n\r\nAlternate case release scenario criteria for McCain Foods USA facility:\r\n\r\nAlternate release scenario is represented by the release of ammonia vapor from a safety relief\r\nvalve (SRV) due to an over pressurization condition on a vertical vessel located within the\r\nMcCain Foods facility machine room.  SRV would be performing exactly as it is designed to do.\r\n."

There were no damages on, or off site. \r\n\r\n6/15/96   During a defrost cycle a freezer safety relief valve opened due to improper\r\n          positioning of shutoff valve and released 178 pounds of ammonia.  With no wind\r\n          present the resultant ammonia cloud suspended over the building.  Ore-Ida Foods\r\n          employees as well as Wright Products (adjacent facility) employees were \r\n          evacuated.
