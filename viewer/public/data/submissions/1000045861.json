It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Superior Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 3 Emergency Planning District (Dickinson County, Iowa LEPC) will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Superior, Iowa location is Mark Anderson, Facility Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided below. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\r\n\r\n                      Mark Anderson, Location Manager\r\n                               WORK:    (712) 858-4491\r\n                               24-Hour:  (712) 330-7921\r\n                            \r\n                     Tom Evans, Operations\r\n                               WORK:     (712) 858-4491"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of two(2) storage tanks including valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).  At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year).\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. \r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a transfer hose while filling a nurse wagon. \r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\r\n\r\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Superior and Christopherson Slough/Swan Lake Wildlife Refuge, consideration has been given to the need for no"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1999 with amendments and State Law. \r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, The Andersons has extended to the Superior Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant.  Mutual aid departments including the Spirit Lake and Lake Park Fire Departments also attended the facility tour.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nThe Andersons Superior Farm Center has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of The Andersons to immediately notify the Superior Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 3 Emergency Planning District (Dickinson County, Iowa LEPC) to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Superior Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Superior location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Superior has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 3 Emergency Planning District (Dickinson County LEPC). Members of the fire department and the LEPC have toured our anhydrous ammonia plant. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from spills and accidental releases.
