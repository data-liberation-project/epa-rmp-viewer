The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\r\nHoosier Energy is committed to providing a safe environment for its employees, contractors, visitors, neighbors and surroundings.  This includes the prevention of accidental releases of any substance as well as the regulated substance: anhydrous ammonia.  Hoosier Energy has several policies in place to provide guidance and training for maintaining a safe environment.  In the event of a release or emergency, Hoosier Energy has established a Standard Operating Procedure for emergency responses.  Hoosier Energy has dedicated bulletin #24 in the Manual of Administrative Bulletins to Corporate Safety and Health Policy.  The plant has an additional policy book, Merom Generating Station Plant Policies, which includes sections on safety and training.  Additional training and safety procedures have been established in response to bringing ammonia onto the plant site.  \r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Merom Generating Station consists of two identical 515-MW coal-fired steam electric generating facilities.  Both units began commercial operation in the early 1980s.  This station is located approximately six miles west southwest of Sullivan in Sullivan County, Indiana.\r\n\r\nEach unit has a turbine generator, with natural circulation arranged for balanced draft operation firing pulverized coal, and all auxiliary equipment to make a complete generating unit.  Emissions are controlled by: electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to reduce particulate, a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system for SO2 reduction, reagent injection system for H2SO4 reduction and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which utilizes ammonia as the reagent to react with the catalyst in reducing the Nox.  The ammonia used in the SCR process is the regulated substance for this program.  Hoosier Energy has two 42,500 gal"

Due to the nature of ammonia storage the tanks will contain some quantity at all times.  \r\n\r\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThis facility complies with several rules and regulations that apply to the storage, handling and use of anhydrous ammonia including OSHA PSM.  Hoosier Energy retained the services of a consultant to assist in the development of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA was developed using the What-if method to identify hazards and to establish plans to prevent process problems.  Additional employee training has been conducted and will be continued to assure a safe environment.  With the addition of the ammonia to the plant site the plant personnel were trained specifically on procedures in dealing with ammonia handling, use and storage.  A higher level of training was provided to certain employees that will be in daily contact with the actual ammonia process.  \r\n\r\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\r\nMerom Generating Station has had no reportable accidents in the past five years.\r\n\r\n5.  The Emergency Response Program\r\nThe emergency response for an ammonia release will include notifying authorities through the 911 system.  In addition the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) will be notified directly by the plant system supervisor.  Site personnel have been trained to respond to the emergency in the event one would occur.  Plant supervisors will authorize the use of audible alarms for plant safety personnel to respond and for plant personnel to take necessary precautions for personal safety.  Public notification may include the use of phones, possible door to door notification, and other systems as they become available.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety improvements and training will be an ongoing process.  The Vaporizer Skids portion of the ammon"
