The response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis. The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been trained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response personnel. Training and maintenance schedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods/Portionables?North Sioux City, South Dakota facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods/Portionables has developed and implemented a PSM program for the facility, in conjunction with Sargento?s involvement in operations in 2009.  The PSM will be audited every three years. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) will be conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The last PHA was conducted on December 9, 2008. The PHA showed that the facility appears to have an adequate number of safeguards and implied that the facility was safe. All PHA concerns are in the process of being addressed."
