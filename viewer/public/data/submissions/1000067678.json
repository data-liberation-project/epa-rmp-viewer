Corning Concord's prevention program complies with all applicable U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program regulations codified under 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nCorning Concord maintains a management system to oversee the implementation of and compliance with all elements of the RMP regulations.  This management system, along with other Corning Concord policies, provides a means to eliminate and/or reduce the potential for hazardous chemical releases at the plant.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program Level 3\n\n\n\nCorning Concord is a Program 3 facility.  Therefore, Corning Concord's prevention program provides for policies, procedures, and syst"

Corning Concord's prevention program also addresses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program elements, which are similar to those required by the RMP regulations.  The prevention program in place for the facility is maintained in Corning Concord's Process Information Management System (PIMS) document control system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0     Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nSite Description\n\n\n\nThe 155-acre Corning Concord plant site is owned and operated by Corning Incorporated, Telecommunications Products Division.  The site is located at 14556 Highway 601 South, Midland, Cabarrus County, North Carolina.  The Corning Concord plant currently employs approximately 550 full-time employees engaged in the manufacture of fiber optics.  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant that exceeds the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68; therefore, chlorine is the only substance at the plant for which the RMP regulations apply.  The chlorine storage and distribution system is contained in a specially designed process building.  The majority of the chlorine utilized at the facility is contained with the Bulk Chlorine Storage Building that is equipped with vent make-up and exhaust scrubber systems.  The chlorine process was installed as part of the fiber optic manufacturing process.  Chlorine is received, stored and distributed to four (4) control panels.\n\n\n\nChlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2 and serves as a chlorinating or oxidizing agent.  Chlorine is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and OSHA listed toxic chemical, an irritant, and a corrosive substance.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen or a flammable substance.  OSHA's ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for chlorine is 1 ppm.  The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA"

Overviews of the program are as follows.\n\n\n\nCorning Concord keeps detailed process safety information on all operations.  The PIMS document control system is an integral part of the management of change for all facility operation\n\n\n\nEmployee training is ongoing in all plant areas and is the backbone of employee knowledge and job operations.  Employee training in operations and maintenance provides an awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used on-site.  \n\n\n\nMaintenance and preventative maintenance are implemented in all facility operations to ensure the mechanical integrity of each piece of equipment.\n\n\n\nIncident investigations of accidents and potential accidents allow learning from each incident as well as provide corrective actions for each incident.  Environmental Non-conformance reports are completed if a chemical was involved.\n\n\n\nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed under the Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nSafe work practices used throughout the facility include Hot Work Permits, Lock-Out/Tag-Out Permits, Vessel Entry Permits, Site Security, and Breaking into Chemical Lines.\n\n\n\nContractors must meet Corning Concord's high safety and technical standards as part of contractor selection and ongoing contractor evaluations.  Also, Corning Concord requires training of contractors in their specific work locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention features of the Corning Concord facility include those listed previously, as well as, th"

The building is equipped with temperature controls and make-up vents.  The building is operated under negative pressure created by the vent scrubber.  There are two (2) modes of vent operations:  normal and emergency.  In the event of a chlorine release, the vent system doubles the air turnover through the building.  \n\n\n\nRedundant system.\n\n\n\nEquipment Design\n\n\n\nThe chlorine piping system is constructed of Hastelloy metal tubing.  This tubing is both compatible with chlorine (non-corrosive) and rated to 1,500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine is only 150 psig allowing for a 10 to 1 safety margin.
