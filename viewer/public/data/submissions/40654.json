If an accidental release should accur, the facillity is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored ,and distributed for application for crop production nutrients.The maximum guantitiy stored would be  97000 pounds in our two 12000 gal. Storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport holding 18000 pounds.The worse case scenaeio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 min. The maximum quantity released would be about 45000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 precent capacity as limited by the owners instructions and design standards,.the distance to the end point is .64 miles.The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a hose. The distance to the end point is .4 miles. The facillity has implemented the provisions and is in compliance with the Oklahoma Dept. Of Agrilculture. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage. The facillity has a written emergy action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,29CFR1910.38 .The facillity has provided state and localk authorities the emergency planning and right -to- know information as required under SARA Title lll. The facillityhas a written responce program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.120 including preemergency planning and employee training. Planned changes to improve safety. Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facillity, therefore, all evaluations are preformed and maintence of safe conditions are preformed by the owner "
