The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Libbey's employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordingating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency providers.\n\nLibbey's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Libbey Glass, Shreveport, Louisiana facility combines raw materials to produce glassware. The raw materials used in the processes include various dry ingredients that are melted in a furnace and then pressed or blown into various shapes of ware. Support operations include a Flammable Mixture (Thomas Gas C-53) gas system, limited quantities of hydrogen and acetylene and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP and 29 CFR 1910.119, PSM. The chemical, Flammable Mixture (Thomas Gas C-53) is used to lubricate molds in the forming department. The gas is burned and the resulting residue (soot) is deposited on the mold and acts as a lubricant to keep the hot glass from adhering to the mold. Thomas Industrial Gasses, Inc. preforms all transport unloading operations and supplies the Thomas Gas C-53. This system includes one (1) 30,000 gallon tank filled to a maximum of 91% of capacity. One (1) additional 30,000 gallon tank is also onsite, however, it has been emptied and"

For the purposes of this Plan, the tables and information provided in the EPA, \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Propant Storage Facilities,\" is used as a conservative approach, since Thomas Gas C-53 is slightly heavier and less flammable than propane. \n\nA 4,675 hydrogen tank at the facility holds about 2,200 pounds when kept at 86% full. Portable acetylene tanks used for torch cutting are stored in a rack or ditributed as needed throughout the facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nLibbey has not had a release of Flammable Mixture (Thomas Gas C-53) from this facility that has affected the public or the environment. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nLibbey has contract personnel, Ever Safe Response (ESR) trained in emergency response available to the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week. These personnel receive training on emergency procedures and response techniques. In addition, the Caddo Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Caddo-Bossier Office of Emergency Preparedness, will respond to an offsite emergency. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLibbey, Inc completes a throrough review of the Flammable Mixture (Thomas Gas C-53) systems each time a design change is implemented. The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised. Libbey is committed to using these methods to implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
