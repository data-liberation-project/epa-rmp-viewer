      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nPPG Refinish - Lima, OH 45806\n\nPPG Refinish - Lima Distribution Center - Lima, OH\n\nThe PPG Refinish Lima Distribution Center complies with applicable Ohio and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG Lima also follows applicable Responsible Care (registered service trademark) Codes of Management Practices including the Community Awareness Code of Management Practices, and PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG also trains Distribution Center employees in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling procedures, and fork truck driving safety. All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, whose main goal is \"to market, distribute and manufacture products globally in a manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\u00bf\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nPPG\u00bfs Lima Distribution Center (Lima DC) is a new facility that is part of the PPG Automotive Refinish business unit.  The Lima DC stores automotive refinish paint, primers and related products and distributes them to both internal refinish distribution centers and external distributors (jobbers) throughout North America.  The Lima DC stores products in various size containers, including aerosol spray cans. Some of the aerosols contain propane, and butane, which are used as propellants. These materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA-RMP regulation. \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed per the EPA guidelines. This would involve the highly unlikely ignition, and explosion of a vapor cloud formed by the release of the entire contents of the largest storage container.\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for the largest quantity of propellant (i.e., - the"

      "SummaryText": "regulated substances) in the largest aerosol can stored at the facility.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp software was used to perform the analysis. The result of the analysis is 27 feet. Please note that this distance is reported as \"0.01 miles\" in the RMP submittal due to limitations of EPA's RMP Submit software. Based on EPA RMP criteria, the worst case release scenario does not have offsite impact.\n\nBecause the worst case scenario has no off site impact, no alternative release scenario analysis is required by the RMP regulation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of aerosol products at the Lima DC which resulted in on-site or off-site impacts as defined by EPA's RMP criteria.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP regulation specifies that covered processes at all facilities must be classified as Program Level 1, 2 or 3 processes. The PPG Lima DC aerosol storage process is classified as a Program Level 1 process because the Worst-Case Scenario has no off-site impact and because there were no accidental releases in the past five years that meet RMP criteria. Submission of specific prevention program information for Program Level 1 processes is not required by RMP. \n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\nThe PPG Lima Distribution Center coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department. \n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor additional information, contact Mr. Bob Cross at (419)-993-2410."
