This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Sierra Pine is a facility run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics - Safety and Compliance Department that includes Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nLineage Logistics - Sierra Pine is located at 3001 Sierra Pine Avenue, Vernon. California 90058, and is situated approximately 1 mile south of Interstate 5 and lies on the intersection of Sierra Pine Avenue and Bandini Boulevard.   The area immediately surrounding the facility is a mixture of mostly urban and some rural areas. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThe facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Sierra Pine, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia co"
