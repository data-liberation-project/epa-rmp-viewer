Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\nBrenntag Southeast Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\nBrenntag Southeast Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nContinual updating of procedures and training."
