To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods PINE BLUFF (JP), this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods PINE BLUFF (JP), has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n      Poultry slaughter plant & further processing. \n \n      Regulated substance: Anhydrous Ammonia \n  \n3.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n\tTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.

      "SummaryText": "trol, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures using fixed systems at the plant, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing. Tyson employees will not respond to emergency incidents involving ammonia above immediately dangerous to life and health concentrations (IDLH) due to limitations in training and equipment maintained on-site. The facility relies on defensive action support from the local Fire Department who would assist with evacuations and vapor suppression if necessary. If deemed necessary, the local fire department would make contact with the Local Emergency Planning Commission to request Regional Hazardous Materials Team support for a Technician Level hazardous materials response. The first resources likely to respond under the regional program would be the Lafayette County Hazard Response Team. Protocols are in place to request this resource if needed and a teaming agreement is in place between Tyson, Inc. and the emergency services entities involved. Site visits and tours are routinely planned with local emergency responders. All Team members are trained in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or a member of management immediately. Supervisors are taught to report the above to the Safety or Maintenance department immediately for further investigation and action by the Refrigeration Team. SDS information is accessible to all team members for review.\n     \t\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n     (UPDATE EQPT. AS NEEDED)"
