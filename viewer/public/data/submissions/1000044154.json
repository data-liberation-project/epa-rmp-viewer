      "SummaryText": "The Southern Nevada Water System (SNWS) is a water utility company that uses chlorine as a disinfectant to produce potable water. SNWS is the primary potable water supplier in southern Nevada.  The mission of SNWS is to \"provide reliable and quality water\" to the customers residing in southern Nevada.\n\n\n\nThe senior management team at SNWS is firmly committed to achieve a safe work place for the employees at the water treatment facilities by protecting their health and wellness while striving to eliminate exposures to highly hazardous chemicals. The goal of the SNWS senior management team is to achieve full compliance with the applicable federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, as well as the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  \n\n\n\nOur commitment to total chemical safety is demonstrated through: \n\n1.) The employment of a full-time chemical engineer at the water treatment plant who is dedicated to evaluate and improve the water treatment processes, \n\n2.) A process safety engineer is assigned to SNWS to focus on the OSHA PSM, EPA RMP and Nevada CAPP compliance programs, \n\n3.) Implementing and improving the comprehensive PSM/RMP/CAPP programs to ensure the following are systematically evaluated and implemented: chlorine process design, process modifications, process technology, process hazard analysis, operational and maintenance activities, standard operating procedures and employee training, \n\n4.) Coordinating with the local emergency responders including the Clark County Fire Department and the National Park Service on emergency response program, \n\n5.) Implementing an orientation procedure to inform visitors of chlorine and other non-PSM chemicals stored at the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Facility (AMSWTF), and the general site safety protocol plus site evacuation plan, \n\n6.)

The SNWS employees remain vigilante in following safe work practices, doing the right thing, and ensuring safety through continuous education and training efforts. \n\n8.) Working with the State of Nevada OSHA office and State of Nevada CAPP Division on their audits/ inspections of the AMSWTF Chlorination System as part of the continuous improvement efforts.  \n\n\n\nSNWS has two water treatment facilities with a combined total maximum production capacity of 900 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water. Both are situated in remote locations and away from the densely populated areas of Clark County, Nevada. The AMSWTF is the larger of the two facilities and the only one that use chlorine as disinfectant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP covered chemical.   \n\n\n\nThe SNWS water treatment process starts by pumping raw water from Lake Mead into a contactor building to undergo ozone disinfection where ozone and oxygen gas mixture generated on-site are diffused, mixed and dissolved into water traveling through the contactor to achieve desired disinfection.  In the event the ozone generation system is down for maintenance, AMSWTF can use chlorine gas as a back-up disinfectant.  \n\n\n\nFollowing ozone disinfection, the ozonated water flows through a channel to the rapid mixers where a coagulant aid is added to combine the waterborne suspended particles.  Water then flows into multiple flocculation basins where the gentle mixing of water and coagulant aid causes the suspended particles to form larger clumps called \"floc\".  \n\n\n\nFrom the flocculation basins, water flows to the multi-media filters where the last step of physical polishing takes place.  As water passes through these filters, \"floc\" is trapped and collected and the filtered water passes through to the storage clearwell.  A corrosion inhibitor "

The finished water is now ready to be distributed to water users that include City of Boulder City, Clark County, City of Henderson, City of Las Vegas, City of North Las Vegas, and outlying areas.   \n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine is stored in trailers and shipped to AMSWTF by truck transport then kept in two enclosed buildings which have equipment to park the trailers and to evaporate the liquid chlorine for use as disinfectant.  Access to the two chlorine buildings is restricted to SNWS employees, authorized contractors, or visitors. AMSWTF also maintains an onsite meteorological monitoring station. The prevailing winds at AMSWTF are to the north-northwest; towards the Saddle Island cove and Lake Mead area.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine facility was designed and constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, and complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  \n\n\n\nTo ensure chemical safety, a multitude of technological steps have been incorporated into the AMSWTF chlorine system:\n\n\n\n1.) The entire process is housed inside two chlorine buildings and is monitored and controlled remotely by operators located in a separate control room, \n\n2.) Chlorine sensors are located inside the two chlorine buildings to continuously monitor chlorine level, \n\n3.) The same two buildings are kept under a slight vacuum, i.e., the pressure inside the building is slightly less than the outside ambient pressure; such a set-up minimizes chlorine leaking from inside the building to the outside, \n\n4.) In case of a chlorine trailer roll-over, each trailer has two excess flow valves to shut-off chlorine flow to minimize discharges, \n\n5.) Each chlorine trailer is of double-shell construction, \n\n6.) Each chlorine trailer also has an emergency"

A chlorine scrubber unit is in service and activates at a pre-set chlorine level; the scrubbing chemical media neutralizes the leaking chlorine vapor to minimize chlorine released into the ambient atmosphere, \n\n8.) Both chlorine buildings have sprinkler systems and fire walls, \n\n9.) Gaseous chlorine is delivered under vacuum by PVC pipe to different application points such that, in case of a chlorine pipe leak, air is pulled into the pipe rather than chlorine gas released into the environment. \n\n\n\nAdministrative controls are also incorporated into the chlorine safety program; specifically, Treatment Division employees and Production Division operators in the control room who work with chlorine:\n\n\n\n1.) Are trained in established standard operating procedures (SOP) and management of change (MOC) requirements, \n\n2.) Have received 24-hour hazardous materials technician training to deal with accidental release of chlorine, \n\n3.) Have received annual 8-hour hazardous materials refresher training, \n\n4.)

AMSWTF also has a dedicated chlorine emergency response plan (ERP) that is reviewed and updated routinely. Additionally, visitors to AMSWTF are informed of general safety rules and chemical safety at the facility entrance gate by way of a visitor orientation procedure.  \n\n\n\nThe AMSWTF chlorine ERP spells out the purpose, scope, roles and  responsibilities, chain of command, line of communication, hazard recognition and prevention, alarm system, site security and control, evacuation plan, "

The State of Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Enforcement Section (OSHES) conducted a wall-to-wall audit of the AMSWTF PSM compliance program in April 2009.  EPA Region 9 and the State of Nevada CAPP, along with the Clark County Fire Department (CCFD) inspectors, engaged in a multi-agency audit of the AMSWTF RMP program on May 13, 2009.
