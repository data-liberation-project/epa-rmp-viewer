Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\r\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary.\r\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request.\r\nWe will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employees level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\r\nThe McPherson Station was built and put into service in 1974. The Butane addition was added to the station in 2007. The facility was built to store and transport butane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The butane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via an 8 inch and an 10 inch pipeline, to the McPherson Station from the NuStar Terminals in Augusta and El Dorado Kansas. The 1,680,000 lbs. of butane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of four, pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is stored in one of the pressurized bullet tanks. The butane is transferred out of the station via pipelines to other NuStar Terminals downstream.\r\nThe McPherson Facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited to;\r\n- OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n- OSHAs Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38(c).\r\n- OSHAs HAZWOPER Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.\r\n- Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990: U.S. DOT Final Rule for Transportation Related On-Shore Facilities a"

We have had no accidental releases in the last five years and in fact the McPherson Station was built in 1974 and to this date we have had zero butane releases. \r\nThe McPherson Emergency Response Program works together with the McPherson Fire Department and the NCRA Refinery Fire Brigade. The McPherson employees are not first responders, but have received training in the notification process of the McPherson and NCRA Fire Department (first responder). The employees also participate in an annual evacuation drill, in the event an evacuation is required. \r\nVarious employees at the McPherson Station have received CPR training, and all employees have received annual HAZWOPER training. Numerous other drills are conducted at the McPherson Station as stated previously.\r\nSafety is the #1 core value of our company. Whether in performing everyday work or in the planning and maintenance of project work, safety is top priority. Some of the improvements towards safety have been: \r\n- Management and employees have teamed together to achieve the OSHA VPP Star award. In this pursuit, there are several \r\n  changes to improve safety and some of them are;\r\n - Quarterly Hazard Identification Audits\r\n - Electrical cord quarterly inspection program\r\n - First Use Vehicle inspection program\r\n - Lifting sling(s) quarterly inspection program\r\n- The regional office is implemented an electronic MOC process,"
