These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  Darling International's plan to improve safety are conducting yearly evacuation drills and offer continual training for operators.\r\n\r\nDarling International in Grand Island, NE is a pet food processing facility. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The total anhydrous ammonia inventory in this single process is 17,750 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated as a two stage system. On t"

The holding freezer unit is designed to maintain a -10&#61616;F room temperature. The low temperature ammonia liquid flows through the freezer coils and plate freezers where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor. The low pressure ammonia vapor and any un-vaporized liquid is returned from the freezer coils to the recirculator via a suction header.\r\n\r\nVapor from the recirculator is fed to a low stage booster compressor. The compressed vapor from the low stage compressor is sent to an intercooler operating at 20&#61616;F.\r\n\r\nThere is a beef cooler unit and a production floor unit that are fed by the high stage portion of the refrigeration system. Both units are designed to maintain a 40&#61616;F room temperature. Controlled pressure liquid is fed from the Controlled Pressure Receiver to each of these units. The ammonia liquid flows through the evaporator coils where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor. The ammonia vapor is sent from the coolers to the intercooler via a common suction header.\r\n\r\nVapor from the intercooler is fed to a high stage compressor. During the compression phase in the high stage compressor, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150 - 190 psig. The high pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressor to the evaporative condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid. The high pressure liquid is collected in the thermosiphon receiver where it provides oil cooling for the two compressors.  The overflow of high pressure liquid is collected in the controlled pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan at Darling International requires all associates to be trained in safe evacuation and notification procedures in cases of actual or dri"

Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and what should be done after evacuating a building. To aid in the training process evacuation drills are conducted at the facility.  In the case of an emergency, Kevin Bosshamer is the plant manager and is the Incident Commander. The alternate Incident Commander is Melanie Yeutter, Safety Coordinator.  Arrangements have been made to coordinate Darling's Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\r\n\r\nHall County LEPC \r\n308-385-5360\r\n\r\nGrand Island Police & Fire Department\r\n911\r\n\r\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their lead person, supervisor, the Human Resources Department, the security guard or the Maintenance Department using the phone, radio, or wireless phones. The lead person or supervisor of the affected area, Human Resources, or maintenance personnel are to contact the Primary ERC. If the Primary ERC is not available, the alternate ERC shall be notified next.  The ERC will determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action and should activate the evacuation alarm if necessary.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, first determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area.   The use of a blow horn will inform employees that they are to evacuate the building.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor.

A daily crew/employee list shall be maintained for each department within the facility. Ten minutes will be allowed for critical unit operators to shutdown their equipment and reach the designated meeting location before attendance will be reported.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the worst case scenario assessment, the low side recirculator can hold a maximum of 18,404 lbs completely full.  There is a maximum intended inventory of 17,750 lbs at this facility. The worst case scenario is assuming the maximum charge of ammonia in the facility is released if it was all located in the low side recirculator. The low side recirculator is located inside the engine room.  If the entire charge were to release within 10 minutes, the distance to endpoint of the release would be 1.4 miles.\r\n\r\nThe scenario of a worst case ammonia release is unlikely due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1.\tWorst-case weather conditions are uncommon.\r\n2.\tIndustry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels.\r\n3.\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\r\n4.\tPressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel.\r\n5.\tInstalled ammonia sensors in the engine room to warn of leaks.\r\n6.\tThe emergency response plan in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nDarling International has not had any accidents to report since the commissioning of this plant."
