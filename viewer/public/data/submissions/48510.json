Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of dry fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to area farm fields.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility is 354,000 pounds in two 12,000 gallon tanks, 12 ? 1,500 gallon nurse tanks, one 1,800 gallon nurse tank and 37 ? 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by out side carrier tank trucks holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Scenario\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case scenario and alternative-case scenario, however, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4.    The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the \nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of \nAnhydrous Ammonia.?  In addition, Minnesota Dept. of Ag Rules.\n\n5.    The Five-year Accidental History\n\nThere have not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or sign"
