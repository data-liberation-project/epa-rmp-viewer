      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOccidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), owns and operates a chlor-alkali manufacturing facility in Mobile, AL. This facility is known as the Mobile Plant and is located at 1300 Jarvis Road, off Highway 43, 1/2 mile south of Chickasaw, AL.  The chlor-alkali facility consists of a plant that manufactures chlorine, caustic potash and hydrogen and also facilities to store load and ship chlorine, caustic soda and caustic potash.  The facility was originally constructed in 1963 and employs 51 full-time OxyChem employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a)):\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Mobile Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Mobile Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Mobile Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Mobile Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances re"

In fact, the Mobile Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyChem's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Mobile Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Mobile Plant, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyChem strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: OxyChem implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Mobile Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  OxyChem also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety a"

In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyChem's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release: In the event of an accidental release, the Mobile Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  OxyChem utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  OxyChem trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Chlorine Emergency Response Team that is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental chlorine release.  OxyChem also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to assistant in all emergencies.  In addition, OxyChem works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  OxyChem has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Mobile County Emergency Response Plan.\n\nMobile Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, EPA and Alabama regulations.  This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Mobile Plant.  If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Mobile County Emergency Response Plan is initiated by a"

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the plant's processes and as training guide.\n\n4.1.4 Training\nThe Mobile Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.  The area technicians are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the area technicians are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n4.1.5 Mechanical Integrity\nThe Mobile Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant's processes.

The facility has implemented a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA, in August 1998, as an OSHA Star facility under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nOxyChem is an industry leader in the implementation of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association sponsored Responsible Care (TM)  Initiative. As part of OxyChem's Responsible Care (TM) efforts, the Mobile plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since 1994. The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, OxyChem established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\nOver the past five years the Mobile Plant has received the following safety and environmental awards:\n\nOxyChem:\nSilver Safety Award - 2 years, 3/12/95 to 3/12/97, without a recordable injury.\nBronze Safety Award - 1 year, 9/23/97 to 9/23/98, without a recordable injury.  \nEnvironmental Merit Awards - 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, & 1998\nOxyMin Pollution Prevention Awards - 1994, 1996, 1997, & 1998\n\nChemical Ma"

USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Mobile Plant:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - Chlorine\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for chlorine is the failure of one loaded 90-ton rail car that would release 180,000 pounds of liquid chlorine in a 10-minute period as mandated by EPA.  It is assumed that the liquid chlorine vaporizes within the 10-minute time period.  The largest volume containing vessel was not selected for the worst case scenario.  These 100-ton storage tanks are located in a diked containment area.  This contained area will prevent a chlorine vaporizing cloud from travelling to the maximum distance expected if there were no containment.  A 90 ton railcar can not be maintained in a containment area during its entire stay at this facility.  Consequently, this size vessel was selected for the scenario.  The worst-case release scenario was evaluated using RMP*COMP (TM).  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance of 14 miles before the concentration of chlorine was reduced to below 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm, which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RM"

      "SummaryText": "P rule. The U.S. Census indicates that 327,000 people live within this distance from the car loading spot; several public receptors are also located within this distance. Environmental receptors are also located within this distance.\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" is the failure of a 1-inch loading hose connected from the liquid chlorine tank car loading header to a rail car releasing 330 lbs. of chlorine vapor in a 30 second time period.  The RMP*COMP (TM), was used for alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences.  Assuming a wind speed of 3 meters/sec, a D stability class and urban topography, the chlorine cloud would travel 0.4 miles before reaching a chlorine concentration of below 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm, which is the endpoint Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule.  The U.S. Census indicates that 39 people live within this distance from the railcar loading spot.  The public receptors for this scenario would be residences and small commercial businesses located near the facility. \n\n3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in 30 lb. cylinders; however, the total quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (' 68.155(d)):\n\nBeginning in 1994, the Mobile Plant revised the existing prevention program for the chlorine manufacturing and storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements.\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant's fenceline.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Mobile Plant's Program 3"
