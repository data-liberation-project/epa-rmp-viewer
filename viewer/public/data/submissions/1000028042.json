(CST) facility located at 14292 Koalstad Road in Conroe, Texas.  This is the facility's first RMP submittal.\n\nIn compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, the facility's Risk Management Program document, which is summarized by this plan, describes the following components of RMP:\n\n-A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential on-site and       off-site impact of worst-case and alternate release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n\n-An accidental release prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, mechanical integrity, training, management of change, process safety information and other similar information involving formaldehyde and isopropylamine.\n\n-An emergency action plan to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n\n-An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management system.  \n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with applicable regulations for the on-site chemical storage and blending process covered by RMP regulations.\n\nThe facility utilizes both a formaldehyde solution (CAS No. 50-00-0)and isopropylamine (CAS No. 75-31-0) as components to manufacture different surface active agents.  The facility stores both formaldehyde and isopropylamine at a stationary source in amounts greater than the RMP thresholds of 15,000 and 10,000 pounds, respectively.  A catastrophic release of either of these  substances could impact public receptors; therefore, the facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving formaldehyde or isopropylamine within the past 5 years.\n\nThe facility has performed a worse-case release scenario which estimates a potential loss of 19,000 gallons (equivalent to 171,000 lbs)of"

In the alternative, the facility has evaluated a 36,600 pound release of formaldehyde which could travel up to two-tenths of a mile.\n\nThe facility has also performed a worse-case release scenario which estimates a potential loss of 22,000 pounds of isopropylamine which could potentially travel up to 0.2 miles.  In the alternative, the facility has evaluated a 275 pound release of isopropylamine which could travel up to one-tenth of a mile.\n\n\n\nCST's Emergency Response Program is compliant with RMP regulatory requirements cited in 40 CFR 68.90(b)(1)and(3), and the plant is a non-responding facility.\n\nThe facility's Emergency Action Plans/Response Program limits employees to actions to prevent small leaks or releases (e.g. shutting a valve), mitigating a release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard, and other similar actions to minor incidents that are considered incidental responses.  Emergency actions for the facility have been coordinated with the local fire department.\n\nThe Risk Management Program will be revised as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable RMP regulations and to improve safety.
