The program will conform to OSHA and US EPA regulations contained in 29 CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nSinclair Casper Refining Company has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program. Sinclair Casper Refining Company will update the Safety Management and Risk Management Programs every five years. Emphasis is placed on managing the higher risk areas of our facilities first, the priority of which will be established by each Casper Refining Company team.\n\n\n\nStatement of Sinclair Casper Refining Company\n\n\n\nThe Management of the Sinclair Casper Refining Company in Evansville, Wyoming recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both its workers and the local community.\n\n\n\nOur policy is to ensure that our efforts with prevention through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance, and communication with our neighbors will help us prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company operates a variety of processes in petroleum refining to manufacture products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, asphalt, butane, and propane) from raw crude oil. Most of the processes use heat, catalyst, and pressure to manufacture the above products from the crude. \n\n\n\nThe refinery has the following Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated flammables i"

Seven RMP-regulated processes were identified at the facility per the 40 CFR Part 68 implementation guidelines. Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411. Six processes are classified as and should meet the requirements for Program 3 processes, and one process is classified as a Program 1 process.\n\n\n\nWe are reporting the following three regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\n\n\n\n* Flammable Mixtures: This represents the mixture of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons found in the piping and process units, and stored in tank farm vessels. The volumes of these hydrocarbons vary by day. The maximum quantity of RMP-regulated Flammable Mixtures onsite does not exceed 37 million pounds.\n\n\n\n* Butanes: This represents a butane/butene mix in storage. The maximum quantity of butanes onsite is less than 500 thousand pounds.\n\n\n\n* Propane. The Maximum quantity of propane onsite is approximately 15,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nH2S and SO2 in the refinery do not meet threshold levels. We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes. Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP. Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nIn the past, the Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers.

While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Sinclair Casper Refining Company. For all RMP Program 3 processes at the Casper facility, RMP allows us to use OSHAs PSM standard as our prevention program. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP, and describes the system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe elements are as follows:\n\n\n\n* Employee Participation\n\n\n\n* Process Safety Information\n\n\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n* Operating Procedures\n\n\n\n* Training \n\n\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n* Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\n* Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\n* Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\n* Management of Change\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation\n\n\n\n* Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company encourages and invites employees to participate in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention.

This information is stored with the Inspection and Testing department.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  \n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has a comprehensive analysis program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP is a very systematic and thorough evaluation of potential hazards in the process unit. The refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with a team formed of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering, and plant management. The team evaluates potential process hazards and identified accident prevention and mitigation measures to ensure safe operating and maintenance of the units. The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures, or practices to put in place to ensure the hazards are managed and mitigated.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for review and resolution.

The revalidation team consists of the same types of personnel that the initial HAZOP does. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue on that schedule until the unit is no longer operating or is removed. Revalidated hazard analysis results are tracked, submitted for management review, and retained and documented until they are complete. Hazard analysis findings are incorporated in the refinery Risk Management Plan after each change triggering RMP re-submission (in 40 CFR 68.190).\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company maintains written procedures for all operations functions at the refinery.

Operators are given a manual that discusses the\n\nequipment, how it works, and what is involved in its operation. Drawings and graphics help the new operator picture the vessels and equipment in the unit. Maintenance personnel also receive guidance on their responsibilities under training by current maintenance personnel. New operators are paired with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks. All new operators are tested on what they have learned, both by study and by demonstration. When operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. All operators periodically receive refresher training in operations to ensure that their skills and knowledge are at a proper level. The refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, and is documented for each operator. Maintenance personnel receive refresher training through the certifications required for inspection and testing. Personnel are required to take the necessary certification training and tests on the appropriate schedule to keep current. \n\n\n\nSinclair also trains personnel in safety practices and emergency response.
