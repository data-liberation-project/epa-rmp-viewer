This will be accomplished at all facilities by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough Process Safety Management and Accidental Release Prevention programs and complete safety training.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management programs will be managed by a Corporate team, but completed at Casper Refining Company under the specific direction of the facility manager. The program will conform to OSHA and US EPA regulations contained in 29 CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nSinclair Casper Refining Company has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program. Sinclair Casper Refining Company will update the Safety Management and Risk Management Programs every five years. Emphasis is placed on managing the higher risk areas of our facilities first, the priority of which will be established by each Casper Refining Company team.\r\n\r\nStatement of Sinclair Casper Refining Company\r\n\r\nThe Management of the Sinclair Casper Refining Company in Evansville, Wyoming recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both its workers and the local community.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to ensure that our efforts with prevention through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance, and communication with our neighbors will help us prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company operates a variety of processes in petroleum refining to manufacture products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, asphalt, butane, and propane) from raw crude oil. Most of the processes use heat, catalyst, and pressure to manufacture the above products from the crude. \r\n\r\nThe refinery has the following Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated flammables i"

Seven RMP-regulated processes were identified at the facility per the 40 CFR Part 68 implementation guidelines. Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411. Six processes are classified as and should meet the requirements for Program 3 processes, and one process is classified as a Program 1 process.\r\n\r\nWe are reporting the following three regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\r\n\r\n* Flammable Mixtures: This represents the mixture of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons found in the piping and process units, and stored in tank farm vessels. The volumes of these hydrocarbons vary by day. The maximum quantity of RMP-regulated Flammable Mixtures onsite does not exceed 37 million pounds.\r\n\r\n* Butanes: This represents a butane/butene mix in storage. The maximum quantity of butanes onsite is less than 500 thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n* Propane. The Maximum quantity of propane onsite is approximately 15,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nH2S and SO2 in the refinery do not meet threshold levels. We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes. Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP. Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers. As part of the offsite consequence analysis required under RMP, Sinclair determined that the potential impact of chlorine on the surrounding may be large. Therefore"

This treatment system is more expensive to operate, yet we felt it was essential to remove chlorine in order to improve the safety of the community and minimize any toxic footprint from our facility.\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has not had any RMP-reportable accidents. While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Sinclair Casper Refining Company. For all RMP Program 3 processes at the Casper facility, RMP allows us to use OSHAs PSM standard as our prevention program. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP, and describes the system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nThe elements are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Employee Participation\r\n\r\n* Process Safety Information\r\n\r\n* Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\n* Operating Procedures\r\n\r\n* Training \r\n\r\n* Contractors\r\n\r\n* Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\n* Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\n* Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\n* Management of Change\r\n\r\n* Incident Investigation\r\n\r\n* Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\n\r\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company encourages and invites employees to participate in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention.
