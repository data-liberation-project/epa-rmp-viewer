This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our equipment adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe regulated equipment is owned by Ineos and is located at the BP Naperville Campus at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois 60563.  The primary purpose of this equipment is to conduct polymer research and development.  At present, Ineos has only one process -- the Polypropylene Process-- which is subject to the Clean Air Act Risk Management Planning requirements.  This process contains two flammable regulated substances which are in excess of the threshold quantity as follows:  propylene and ethylene.  Propylene is stored on site in an outdoor vertical 15,000-gallon tank.  The maximum allowable fill volume of the tank is 12,000 gallons, which equates to 53,000 pounds; this is greater than the quantity of ethylene on-site at any given time.  The propylene tank is located within the facilityA?s 300 Tank Farm.  The tank farm has an additional tank, formerly used to store an isobutylene mixture, which is currently out of service and has been filled with low pressure nitrogen.  Other parts of the covered process include the polyolefin pilot plant, small polyolefin pilot plant and the flammable shed associated with laboratory operation.  Please note that Ineos has no regulated toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\nPREVENT"

Since this process is also regulated by the OSHA PSM standard, this summary is organized in the format of the OSHA PSM elements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIneos encourages employees who work in the Polypropylene Process to participate in multiple facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved are documented in the employee participation plan.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Polypropylene Process personnel keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Polypropylene Pilot Plant has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Polypropylene Pilot Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters.  Polypropylene Process personnel help assure that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nIneos has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  This process applies to the Polypropylene Pilot Plant.   Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nIneos primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nIneos maintains written procedures that address the operation of the Polypropylene Process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIneos has established safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of site entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that research and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Ineos has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in research and development operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) adequate knowledge"

All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nIneos routinely uses contractors to supplement maintenance, construction and operation efforts.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Ineos has procedures in place to help ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety rules, and (6) inform personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  In addition, Ineos, in conjunction with BP, evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Ineos periodically monitors contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nIneos conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nIneos has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, and (4) correcting identified deficiencies.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2)safety and  health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nIneos uses the BP Naperville Complex hot work permit program which details those areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc.  The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit a"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system helps to ensure that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIneos promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audit along with the audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.  \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at Ineos have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP covered processes at Ineos, currently only the Polypropylene Process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Ineos has process safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the 300 Tank Farm. \n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarm.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n2. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n3.

The program includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  In the event of a release, BP Naperville emergency response personnel are the first responders.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, Ineos and the landlord (BP) have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Ineos employees and representatives of the landlord (BP) receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.\n\nBoth Ineos and BP Naperville coordinate with the Naperville Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic training and exercises with local emergency response officials. Ineos has around-the-clock communications capability with the Naperville Fire Department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIneos is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  In particular, the safe operation of the Polypropylene Process is maintained by ongoing evaluations.  For example, through internal audits and employee participation, safety items are regularly identified, evaluated and implemented as appropriate."
