The facility is located in a low-population density rural area.   The facility has in place a safety training program, in which all employees are thoroughly trained to safely manage to processes that they will be associated with during their employment.  This training, at a minimum, meets Federal, State and local statutes and regulations, and is updated periodically.  A monthly safety and training meeting is conducted, in which all employees are required to attend.   Senior management is committed to safety and implementation of safety procedures, as shown by the previous statements.\n                                                                                                                                                 \nWhen there is an accidental release of chemicals from the facility, Wil-Gro reports the release at the earliest possible time, to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality; and in cases where the release is above the reportable quantity, Wil-Gro follows up with information concerning the release and what measures were taken to correct the release and potentially prevent such a release from reoccuring.  Wil-Gro also has significant resources available for accidental release mitigation, including a vacuum truck, and stand-by contractors, available to be contacted in case Wil-Gro needs assistance in mitigating a release. Wil-Gro has an emergency management plan in place to respond to emergency releases.  Wil-Gro also notifies other plants and facilities in the neighboring area, when a release occurs, as part of a 'good neighbor' policy.It is important to note that although it is not required; since this facility makes only 56% Nitric Acid, which is well below the 80% concentration required to be reported in RMPs, Wil-Gro is making a protective filing on its nitric acid process, in a good faith effort.\n\nFor additional inform"

This mixture is purified to end up with three (3) parts hydrogen to one (1) part nitrogen, compressed to 2400 Psig, flows through an ammonia converter, then cooled to as low as -28 deg. F., and ammonia is made.\n\n     The carbon from natural gas and oxygen from steam, react together to form carbon dioxide gas.  This gas is removed from the process by absorption with monoethanalamine. The 250 tons of this carbon dioxide is compressed, purified, moisture removed, cooled to a -30 deg. F. and condensed to produce food-grade liquid carbon dioxide.  The remaining carbon dioxide gas is compressed to 2800 Psig, mixed with liquid ammonia in a reactor, purified, and 400 tons of Urea per day is produced.\n\n     Vaporized liquid ammonia and air supplied by a Brown-Boveri compressor at 125 Psig, are mixed together and pass through a converter containing a catalyst bed then bleached, and absorbed in water to form 56% nitric acid.\n\n     Vaporized ammonia and 56% nitric acid are combined in a neutralizer to produce 86% ammonia nitrate solution.\n\n     Urea and ammonia nitrate solution, on a ration of 45% ammonia nitrate, 35% urea, and 20% water, are mixed to produce 32% nitrogen content urea ammonia nitrate solution, approximately 1000 tons per day.\n\n     The 465 tons per day of 86% ammonia nitrate solution is sent to the pan granulator plant where the water is evaporated and an additive is mixed with the high density nitrate solution.  This is then sprayed on the pan granulator containing recycle material of fines and small material.  The pan rotation shapes the granulars to produce 400 tons of granulars.  This is then cooled, coated with Galoryl, and sent to the bulk warehouse.\n\n     The pan granulated bulk nitrate contains 34% mini"
