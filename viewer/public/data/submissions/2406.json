      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nThe E&J Gallo Fresno Winery is located at  5610 East Olive Avenue in Fresno, California.  The facility crushes grapes in order to produce wine, distilled spirits, and juice for concentrate.  These products are stored prior to shipment to other Gallo facilities for further processing and distribution.\n\nThe facility operates anhydrous ammonia refrigeration to provide product cooling.  Refrigeration systems have storage vessels (receivers) sized to contain all the liquid ammonia in the system, with additional capacity for thermal expansion. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop heat transfer system.  Ammonia moves through the system due to pressure differences produced by the compressors.  A brief description of the ammonia refrigeration cycle follows:\n\n1.  The receiver vessel stores liquid ammonia under pressure.  High pressure liquid ammonia flows from the receiver through liquid lines to the expansion valve, which partitions the pressure and temperature.  Liquid ammonia at reduced pressure and temperature is then piped into the chiller shell.  \n \n2. Product is circulated through sealed stainless steel tubing within the chiller shell.  Heat from the warm product transfers through the tubing walls to the cooler refrigerant, causing liquid refrigerant to boil off as low pressure vapor.  The rate of vaporization, and thereby the cooling of product, is determined by the amount of pressure in the chiller as controlled by a back pressure regulator, and suction from the compressors.\n \n3. The compressors draw the low pressure vapor from the chiller, compress it into high pressure vapor, and discharge to the evaporative condenser (cooling tower).\n \n4. In the evaporative condenser, ammonia vapor flows through tubing which is sprayed with water and located within fan driven air flow to promote cooling.  The ammonia vapor transfers heat through the tubing walls to the cooling water.  The ammonia condenses back to a liquid wh"

For the Fresno facility, the \nworst case scenario involves the sulfur dioxide storage tank.  Under pessimistic weather conditions (stability F, wind speed 1.5 meters per second) sulfur dioxide was predicted to reach the toxic endpoint of 3 parts per million in air at a distance 6.5 miles from the source.  \n\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  Air Permitting Specialists was retained to provide modeling of alternative release scenarios.\n\nSulfur Dioxide - A more credible release scenario would involve damage to piping due to contact from motorized equipment operating in the area.  If damage was sufficient to cause a failure, it could result in a 1 square inch opening.  The release of sulfur dioxide from the opening could be expelled into the air and onto surrounding surfaces.  Under more typical weather conditions (stability D, wind speed 4.5 meters per second)  the predicted distance to the 3 ppm toxic endpoint would be 2.5 miles from the source. \n \nAmmonia - A more credible release scenario would involve damage to liquid ammonia piping at a chiller due to contact from motorized equipment operating in the area.  If damage was sufficient to cause a failure, it could occur at a flange due to bolt failure, and result in a 1 square inch opening.  The release of liquid ammonia from the opening could be expelled into the air and onto surrounding surfaces.  Under more typical weather conditions (stability D, wind speed 4.5 meters per second)  the predicted distance to the 200 ppm toxic endpoint would be 0.5mile from the source.   \n\n ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nThe E&J Gallo Winery employs refrigeration m"

Changes expected to have a significant safety effect on quantity, systems, or procedures will be referred to the appropriate Risk Management Program team for further study.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nE&J Gallo Winery will perform an annual Risk Management Program compliance audit.
