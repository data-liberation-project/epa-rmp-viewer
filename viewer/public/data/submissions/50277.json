We operate our business in a manner that conscientiously safeguards our employees, customers, and the community that we operate in.  In striving for responsible environmental, health, and safey (EH&S) stewardship, Wolf Hollow pledges to:\n\n?Diligently develop, construct, and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the priority on health and safety.\n?Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances, and statutes as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n?Continually measure, evaluate, and improve our EH&S performance.\n?Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors, and vendors.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Wolf Hollow I, LP power plant, located in Granbury, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  Steam is produced from turbine exhaust gases and used to load a power generator.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired combustion turbine exhaust aqueous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust stream.  The aqueous ammonia is stored on-site in storage tanks.  The storage capacity of each storage tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  Aqueous ammonia is not on the OSHA PSM list.  Therefore, Wolf Hollow is subject to RMP Program 2 requirements.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\nManagement System\nWolf Hollow has developed a set of Management System procedures to manage implementation of the elements of the RMP program.  The management system details the scope, purpose, responsibilities and upkeep of each RMP element.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\nAs required by the RMP rule the worst-case release "

The 15,000 gallon tank is limited to 85% of the storage capacity, 12,750-gallons, by administrative controls including operating procedures and high level alarms.  The USEPA?s RMP-Comp version 1.07 software was used in the analysis.  Passive mitigation exists in the form of dikes around the tanks which limits the spread of ammonia.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario.  It was analyzed as a spill or leak in the ammonia tank truck unloading hose.  The tanker truck pumping rate is 80 gpm, which is the release rate listed in the analysis.  A team of Wolf Hollow personnel projected that it would take a maximum of 10-minutes to fully stop the leak. The USEPA?s RMP-Comp version 1.07 software was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, public receptors would be affected by the alternative scenario.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nWolf Hollow maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  The documents include information concerning the hazards of ammonia process technology and process equipment.  This information is updated when changes in the process occur.\n\nHazard Analysis\nWolf Hollow has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidelines from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  Wolf Hollow has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWolf Hollow maintains written operating procedures that address the vendors modes of process operations including initial startup, normal sta"

The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel  and are reviewed annually by team leaders.\n\nTraining\nAll operating personnel at Wolf Hollow are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures for safely operating the process.  Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.  In addition, all employees are given general awareness training on RMP, the hazards of aqueous ammonia, and general emergency response.\n\nMaintenance\nWolf Hollow has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identifiable equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWolf Hollow promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of aqueous ammonia.  The findings of the investigation along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly Wolf Hollow will conduct a performance audit every three years.

These system include:\n?Pressure relief valves;\n?Shut off valves; and \n?Level gauges and indicators.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at Wolf Hollow in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nWolf Hollow maintains a written defensive emergency response program.  The program addresses appropriate aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Hood County LEPC."
