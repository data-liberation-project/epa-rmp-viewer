Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Tri County FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidentalreleases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 700,000 pounds, this includes the maximum capacity of the storage tank.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release  Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc, as adopted by state regulation and standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4. Five year accident history.\n\na. The following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at the facility:\n-We had an accidental release of less than 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on 8/8/02.  Five people were treated and released from the hospital the same day.\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has: \n\n--a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38; \n\n--provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and"
