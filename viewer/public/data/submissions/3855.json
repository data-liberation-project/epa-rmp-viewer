Box 401, Bertrand, Nebraska  68927.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFACILITY POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees operating our facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored at our location.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), emergency response personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviornment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 42291 \"Farm Supplies Wholesalers\" however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we believe most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we include crop protectents in our planning, training and maintenance programs however,  only Anhydrous Ammonia will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early fall months and spring months.  During the balance of the year, little if any product transfer occurs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore, item number 1.11 is "

      "SummaryText": "Zero.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA's RMP-COMP Program (version 1.06) as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protec ted by manual and self-closing excess flow valves, so our alternaitive release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off-loaind transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) as defined Rural is 0.3 miles or 1584 feet per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia and have installed safety equipment including but not limited to:  Excess flow valves and Lockouts to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for e"
