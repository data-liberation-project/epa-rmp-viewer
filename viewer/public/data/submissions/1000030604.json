      "SummaryText": "This document contains all required information in order to meet 40 CFR 68 ?Risk Management Program?.  This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Primera Foods facility in Britt, Iowa has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant currently outsources the maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan which is to provide information and guidance to safely deal with an ammonia release or other plant emergencies.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Primera Foods Britt, IA plant is engaged in the business of egg breaking and egg processing.  The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311999.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the egg products. Primera has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is approximately 15,000 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenario for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE St"

      "SummaryText": "andard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n\n2.    Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n\n3.    Eye contact\n\n\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Scenario Description\n\n\n\nOne worst-case scenario has been developed for the Britt plant.  The largest potential release of ammonia would occur with a release from the liquid receiver tank.  Taking the specific definition of the worst-case from 40 CFR 68.25, the vessel that can store the largest quantity of ammonia is the liquid receiver.  The total quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high stage accumulator is about 7,140 pounds.  The receiver is only filled to the mid-level point or 3570 pounds .  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire 3570 pounds is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  For the worst-case release, regulations dictate that the release height is at ground level.  \n\nUnder Section 68.25(c)(1), a regulated toxic substance such as ammonia that is normally a gas at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure shall be considered to be released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  Thus, ammonia?s physical state in the worst-case scenario is a gas.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario distan"

      "SummaryText": "ce-to-endpoint will reach off-site public receptors.\n\n3.2    Alternative Release Scenario Description    \n\nThe alternative release scenario is an ammonia release from a ruptured loading hose. The release scenario considers a hose rupture from an ammonia loading hose. The hose is assumed to release at 35 gpm or 180.3 pounds per minute.  Administrative and passive controls are not applicable to this scenario.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention.    \n\nThe alternative release scenario distance-to-endpoint may reach off-site public receptors.\n\n    \n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nPrimera Foods has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases since the ammonia system was bought online in September of 2009.\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Britt facility has an emergency response program.  The plant does not have an On-Site HAZMAT Team.  Each year the plant brings in the Britt Fire Department to tour the facility and review our EAP, including key areas of the plant.  The fire department has keys, codes, and access to the facility.  They also have the most recent floor plans.  The last visit was 05/09/2012.\n\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation is accomplished.\n\n"
