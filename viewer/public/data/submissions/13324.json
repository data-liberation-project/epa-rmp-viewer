      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency reponse at our facility . Our facility complies with the American National Saftey requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia with the expectations stated in the Iowa fertilizer law. It is our policy to adhere to all apliciable federal state and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local 911 representatives including the local police, Fayette Fire Department and the Fayette County LEPC. Our facility is a grain elevator we market, dry and store grain. We sell anhydrous ammonia to UAP-Cropmate they in turn sell it to the producer. Our ammonia tank is a 131,000lb tank with associatied piping, vents, relief valves, check valves, excess flow device and manual shut off. The worst case scenario is failure of a 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to the EPA lookup tables the end point would be 4.4 miles. There is schools, residences, business, state parks with the distance to the end point with a total population of 935 people. The general accident release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. This facility complies with the EPA accident prevention rule and all applicible state and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with state law. The five year accident history shows no accident that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system it is our policy to notify 911 the fire department, police and Fayette County LEPC. We have discussed our system with the local emergency services and they have inspected our system. Planned changes to improve saftey inclue tank repainting with proper valve and placard placement."
