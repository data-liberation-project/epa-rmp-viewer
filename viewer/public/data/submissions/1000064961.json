Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing processes.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth.   Our refrigeration system was upgraded and combined 2 systems into one referred to as the \"South Side\" Refrigeration system.\n\nWe comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control plan and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.\n\nWe have a Non-Responding Emergency Response plan that is coordinated with the Wright County Special Response Unit (WCSRU) that has achieved state HAZMAT response certification. Tours/drills/training are conducted on a regular basis.  We also review with the fire dept. and the WCSRU the key points to know about a refrigeration system and invite them to drill at our facility.  Evacuation drills are held on a regular basis with all stakeholders.  These drills are critiqued and any deficiencies are reviewed and appropriate corrective action taken. \n\nPreventive Maintenance is tracked on a computer maintenance management system.
