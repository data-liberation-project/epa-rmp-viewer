The  Naheola Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nGeorgia Pacific has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Naheola Mill plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at Naheola have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemical is chlorine dioxide.\n\n\nMILL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Naheola Mill manufactures, among other products, tissue, towels and paper board and pulp.  It is located on the Tombigbee River near Pennington, Alabama.  Total mill production is 1600 -1900 tons per day.\n\nPower generation consists of one recovery boiler, two combination boilers, which burn bark, wood waste and coal, one power boiler that burns oil and gas, and two package"

The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of twelve elements which are listed below.\n\n\u00b7 Process safety information.\n\u00b7 Process hazard analysis.\n\u00b7 Operating procedures.\n\u00b7 Training.\n\u00b7 Mechanical integrity.\n\u00b7 Management of change.\n\u00b7 Pre-startup review.\n\u00b7 Compliance audits.\n\u00b7 Incident investigation.\n\u00b7 Employee participation.\n\u00b7 Hot work permit.\n\u00b7 Contractors.\n\nSome elements of the prevention program are intended to assure that designs are reviewed so that new processes and equipment are in conformance to safe design principles.  The remainder of the elements assure that the operation, maintenance and control of hazards are performed to prevent inadvertent changes outside the safe design and operating envelope.\n\nNaheola Mill concurs with US EPA's assessment that, Prevention of accidental releases requires a holistic approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  Therefore, Naheola Mill' prevention program is designed to provide for ongoing management of highly hazardous substances.  It is not a list of once and done actions.  Rather it provides a means for assuring safe operations throughout the life of the facility.  To this end, Naheola Mill utilizes modern computer managing techniques in coordination with plant-wide awareness to ensure continued fulfillment of prevention requirements.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY AT THE NAHEOLA MILL\n\nNaheola Mill has an outstanding record of accident prevention over the past five years.  This good record is demonstrated by the lack of any accidental release which had offsite consequences over the past five years and by the decreasing frequency of any kind of accident.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the offsite consequences o"

Pubic receptors are offsite residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals),  commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release.  Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as a result of an accidental release.\n\nThis section describes the worst-case consequence analysis and alternate scenario consequence analyses.  These analyses  comprise the hazard assessment.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR A TOXIC SUBSTANCE \tRELEASE\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at the Naheola Mill is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a tank containing 19,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide as a .95% to 1.25% solution.  In accordance with RMP regulations, the entire 19,000 pounds of chlorine dioxide were assumed to be released as a gas cloud in ten minutes.  Naheola Mill considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning.  Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\n\nChlorine dioxide is generated within the mill utilizing the R-8 process.  It is stored as an aqueous solution of up to .95% - 1.25% grams per liter strength (1.15% by weight) in three 200,000 gallon capacity storage tanks near the center of the mill.  This worst-case scenario consists of failure of the No. 1 (east) chlorine dio"

Therefore, failure of No. 2 tank would not represent worst-case. \n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine dioxide was initially modeled using SLAB, which indicated a distance to the toxic endpoint of 23 miles.  Since then, EPA has released and re-released their RMPComp program, which indicated no significant difference in the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nPer 40 CFR 68.22(e), surface roughness criteria used in the consequence model, obstructions such as trees would be interpreted as an urban area for modeling purposes.  Given the densely populated forest surrounding the plant, an urban model is appropriate.  Both urban and rural settings in RMPComp produced results indicating 22 miles to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe affected area predicted by the analysis includes Demopolis and Butler, Alabama.\n  \n \nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR A FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE RELEASE\n\nThe Naheola Mill does not store flammable materials regulated by the RMP Rule in quantities over the threshold amount.\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR CHLORINE DIOXIDE GENERATION AND STORAGE PROCESS\n\nChlorine dioxide solution is pumped from generation and storage to other processes within the mill.  These other processes include two bleaching processes and a TRS control process.  Chlorine dioxide is pumped to the above mill processes through a 6-inch diameter pipeline.  This chlorine dioxide solution pipe line is supported by a pipe bridge, which is approximately 350 feet long.  Normal solution strength is ranges .95% to 1.25%.\n\nThis alternate-scenario is the rupture of the 6-inch diameter chlorine dioxide pipe line on the pipe bridge between chlorine dioxide storage and the bleach plant.  It is assumed that the rupture would result in a 10 minute"

The recovery boiler is of the low-odor design and equipped with state-of-the-art continuous emission monitors.\n\nOf the total pulp production, hardwood comprises 60% and softwood 40%.  Hardwood pulp is produced in eight batch digesters.  Softwood pulp is produced in one Kamyr continuous digester.  Non-condensable gases are incinerated in the mill's lime kiln. The kiln is equipped with modern continuous emission monitors.  A back-up incinerator is also used.\n\nHardwood and softwood pulps are bleached in separate bleach lines using chlorine dioxide, caustic and oxygen.  Emissions from each bleach line are collected and scrubbed separately with white liquor in two packed tower scrubbers.  Additionally, about 100 tons per day of broke are bleached with sodium hypochlorite.  This bleaching is performed as a separate operation from the two bleach lines.\n\nThe paper mill operates seven paper machines and a pulp dryer.  One of the paper machines is a board machine which produces cup stock.  Another board machine, which has an on-machine coater, produces plate stock.  The other five machines produce tissue and toweling.\n\nPaper and board are converted in the mill.  Some tissue and towels are printed.  Water based and low VOC inks are utilized.  \n\nThe mill operates on-site a waste water clarifier, ash ponds, and an aerated stabilization basin with 53 aerators and a 38 acre non-hazardous process waste landfill.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES AND PROCESSES\n\nThe Naheola Mill operates one processes which have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance. This is:\n\n Chlorine dioxide generation and storage:  This process stores chlorine dioxide solution in 200,000 gallon storage tanks at strengths of .95% -1.25%; this is equivalent to about 19,000 lb of chlorine dioxide.  \n\n\nThe above process is Program 3 processes as defined by the risk management program rule.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Naheola Mill has developed and implemented an accidental relea"

      "SummaryText": "release of the chlorine dioxide solution at the normal pumping rate.  The toxic endpoint concentration for chlorine dioxide is 1 ppmv (0.0028mg/L) and the endpoint distance following the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance is 1.7 miles.\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNaheola Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance.  The Naheola Mill emergency response program utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS.  This is an all risk system developed for on-scene management of any emergency event.  The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact of personnel changes upon the emergency plan.  Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes or facilities.  In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing  of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall community emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Naheola Mill has around-the-clock communications with the LEPC to ensure notification of the public in event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response."
