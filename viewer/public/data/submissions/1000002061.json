Minimum detection level for most individuals = 0.3 ppm.\n2.    At 3-6 ppm, chlorine causes irritation of the upper respiratory tract and mucous membranes.\n3.    The OSHA permissible exposure limit has a ceiling value of 1 ppm.\n4.    NIOSH has assigned 10 ppm as the IDLH value for acute chlorine exposure.\n5.    Exposure of skin and eyes can cause severe frostbite burns.\n6.    \tAcute health problems associated with chlorine gas include respiratory irritation, violent coughing, choking, nausea, dizziness, headaches, vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.\n\nThe Northport Wastewater Treatment Plant has a maximum intended inventory of 8,000  pounds of chlorine.  At any given time, however, the inventory on hand is 4,000 pounds or less.  All procedures involving the disinfection system, other than general inspections, involve at least two employees.  Steps are taken to reduce the risk to employees and the local community alike, through the implementation of administrative controls and appropriate regulations.  In the event of a major chlorine release, the operators of the Northport Wastewater Treatment Plant do not respond to stop the release directly.  The facility\u00c2\u00bfs policy is very simple.  In the event of an accidental release, the operator(s) are to:\n1.    Call 911.\n2.

The formal emergency evacuation plan is kept in readily available location within the main administration and operations building.  The plan has been discussed and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Northport Fire Department.  The appropriate hazard control measures, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment are being used to prevent the hazards that are associated with a chlorine gas release.  These control measures originated and were applied in an effort to improve emergency response actions and to protect the emergency response personnel and the public at large.\n\nExisting Controls\n1.   \tFixed Chlorine Monitor   Located in the storage room.  Detects chlorine present in the air from 0-5 ppm.  Upon detection, the monitor sounds both an audible and visual alarm.\n2.    \tPersonal Chlorine Monitor   Portable, personal monitors are available for use during gas release episodes.  These monitors provide a way to quantitate the contamination levels.  This allows for the determination of the proper type of personal protective equipment deemed necessary and zones for evacuation purposes.\n3.   \tLeak Testing   Leaks within the chlorine system are determined using ammonia solution.  Chlorine will react with discharged ammonia vapor to produce a white cloud.\n4.    \tEmergency \u00c2\u00bfB\u00c2\u00bf Kit   This kit contains the required equipment to stop leaks at the valves, fusible plugs and in the wall of the cylinder (one-ton).\n5.    \tBuddy System   Activities involving the disinfection system, other than general maintenance, require a minimum of two workers to be present at all times.\n6.   \tChemical Handling Schedule   Chemical cylinders are only manipulated during the day shift.

The emergency action plan developed for the Northport facility applies to the use of chlorine in the waste treatment process.  The intent of the plan is to assist the City of Northport, Alabama in its efforts to preclude or mitigate episodic releases of chlorine that could result in the catastrophic loss of personnel and property within the facility and possible the surrounding community.\n \n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant for the City of Northport, Alabama located at 3950 3rd Street, South, is the primary source of waste treatment for the City of Northport.  In the treatment of wastewater, hazardous chemicals may be employed.  At the Northport facility, chlorine delivered in 1-ton cylinders, are used as the primary disinfecting agent.  The chemicals are stored in a building, approximately 100 feet from the main administration and operations building for the facility.  The same properties that make chlorine a valuable commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the Northport facility\u00c2\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nChlorine has the following general properties:\n1.    Chlorine is a gas at room temperature.\n2.    Chlorine becomes an amber liquid at  -29.3 degrees F.  It is usually shipped as a liquid to conserve space.\n3.    Upon the r"
