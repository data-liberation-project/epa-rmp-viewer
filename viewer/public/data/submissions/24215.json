      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nC & F Packing is committed to safety for employees, the public, and the environment and strives to meet all appropriate federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations.  C & F Packing is located at 515 Park Avenue, Lake Vill, Illinois.  The facility packages meat products.  The packaged products are refrigerated in large coolers using an ammonia refrigeration system (ARS).  Anhydrous ammonia has been used as a refrigerant by the food industry for decades.  An ARS contains ammonia is various states including liquid, vapor, and gas in various vessels, compressors, condensers, pipes, and evaporators.  \n\nOn June 26, 1996, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  The intent of the Rule is to prevent accidental releases of toxic substances and to identify potential impacts to public and environmental receptors.  This Rule requires that covered facilities develop and implement a Risk Management Program.  40 CFR 68 regulates anhydrous ammonia when used in a process at amounts greater than the threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.  The C & F Packing facility has undergone renovation in 2001.  The previous ARS did not contain ammonia above the TQ and therefore was not subject to 40 CFR 68.  Upon plant expansion, the ARS was modified.  The new ARS at C & F Packing has a capacity of anhydrous ammonia over the TQ and the refrigeration process will be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, therefore this RMP is being submitted for the newly covered process.    \n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires that a covered facility evaluate two ammonia release scenarios, the \"worst-case\" release and an \"alternative\" release.  The worst-case release for the Portage AMPI plant is the loss of the ammonia in the high-pressure receiver vessel at maximum capacity.  The alternative release scenario is a pipe leak.  Given the safety precautions, maintenance perf"

      "SummaryText": "ormed, and new equipment at the plant, both releases are unlikely.  If a release occurred, however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.  Both ammonia releases were modeled with EPA's RMP Comp software (version 1.06) and ammonia guidance documents.  Both the worst case and alternative releases result in off-site impacts.  \n\nAs mentioned above, releases from the ARS are unlikely.    C & F Packing complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (the PSM Standard) to reduce the possibility of accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals. The PSM standard  (29 CFR 1910.119) is designed to protect employees by preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Facilities using a regulated substance (i.e. ammonia) in excess of a regulated (TQ) are required to develop and implement a PSM program. The OSHA PSM standard can be used to satisfy the prevention program element of EPA's Risk Management Program.  The PSM standard addresses the following 12 areas of the prevention program: \n  \n\u00b7 Employee Participation\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information\n\u00b7 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00b7 Operating Procedures\n\u00b7 Training\n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity \n\u00b7 Management of Change\n\u00b7 Pre-Start up Safety Review\n\u00b7 Compliance Audits\n\u00b7 Incident Investigation\n\u00b7 Employee Participation\n\u00b7 Hot Work Permits\n\u00b7 Contractor Safety\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program at AMPI that are key:\n\n1. C & F Packing ensures that employees are aware of the ARS system's risks and the prevention program elements in place.\n\n2. Design included safety considerations.  For example, major pieces of refrigeration equipment have automatic detection, alarm, and shutdown controls and most ammonia piping is located along ceilings away from people and moving equipment, therefore ammonia releases from accidents are unlikely. \n\n3. The plant maintains training programs for it"
