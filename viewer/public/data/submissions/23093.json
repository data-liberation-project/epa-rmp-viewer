If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and marketing of grain and handling fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct aplication as fertilizer for crop production.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would be 280,000 pounds.  This figure includes our main storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest  bulk storage tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,100 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 2.6 miles.\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to endpoint is approximately 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering  in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program.  Our facility has coordinated with the"
