Its warehouse and storage facility located at 30933 Imperial St. Shafter, California, stores various chemicals for resale. The chemicals are purchased from Manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the Argo Chemical facility, unloaded, stored, blended and reloaded for shipment to the customer. The following are key elements of the RMP plan:\n\n(a)  Argo chemical is a retail operation subject to the OSHA Process Standard. Argo Chemical incorporates all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst-case scenario analysis, alternative release analysis, 5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\n\n(b)  The stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\n\nCompressed Anydrous ammonia:\nArgo chemical handles this product in 4 pressurized tanks. 1-tank with a 15446gal capacity, with a maximum fill capacity of 13130gal. 2-13,000gal tanks with fill capacities of 11,050gal. 1-tank with a 21,619gal capacity with a fill capacity of 18,375gal per management directive. Bulk shipments of Anhydrous ammonia are received by pressurized transport and unloaded directly into the ammonia storage tank battery. Anhydrous ammonia is used on site to produce Aqua ammonia, and for delivery in smaller quantity.\n\nAqua ammonia:\nThis product, handled in bulk, is stored in four tanks. Three of the tanks have a capacity of 25,369gal, with a fill capacity of 21563gal. One tank has a fill capacity of 45,000gal, with a fill capacity of 38,250gal. Each tank is storing 29.5% aqua ammonia. It is loaded into shipping containers using pumps and hoses with vapor return to the vessel from which the product is being removed.\n\n In the unlikely event ("
