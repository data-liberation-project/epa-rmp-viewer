This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event of such a release, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Koochiching County Sheriff's Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nBoise Cascade owns and operates an integrated pulp and paper mill at this location.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Chlorine is used for pulp bleaching.  Chlorine Dioxide is used for pulp bleaching and biocide treatment of water in the paper machine and filter plant areas.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 180,000 lbs.\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine Dioxide at our facility is 29,550 lbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance for our worst case scenario and Cameo/Aloha modeling software for our alternative release scenarios.

      "SummaryText": "e following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 180000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each Program 3 process.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release in the Chlorine piping system.  The scenario involves the release of 116 lb. of Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released into an indoor blowdown tank where it gasses off.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include caustic neutralization.  Under average weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 1169 yards.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine Dioxide involves a release in the Chlorine Dioxide piping system.  The scenario involves the release of 72 lb. of Chlorine Dioxide. Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released indoors to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown procedures and pressure drop sensors.  Under average weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L is 1760 yards.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Informat"

      "SummaryText": "ion\n Boise Cascade maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Boise Cascade maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.  These procedures are certified annually.\n\nTraining\n Boise Cascade has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n Boise Cascade carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified p"
