We strive to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and codes.  This Risk Management Plan has been prepared and implemented to meet the accidental release prevention and emergency response requirements of 40 CFR 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions) and 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management).  \n                                                                                                                                                                                              If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Seneca Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility personnel are trained to identify problems, resolve minor issues, and as necessary, notify emergency responders, shutdown the facility, and evacuate.     \n\n2) Stationary Source:\n  \n   The Van Compressor Station is located along Route 322 in a sparsely populated area of northwestern Pennsylvania. The purpose of the facility is to withdraw high BTU field gas from a nearby production well gathering system, remove hydrocarbon liquid and moisture from the gas, raise the pressure of the gas, and deliver natural gas into the transmission piping system. The extraction plant portion of the facility is second hand equipment that was purchased as a package in 1997 and installed in 1998.  Initial startup occurred during 1998.\n\n   Two interrelated, but distinct, processes carry out the operation. The process that is the focus of this Risk Management Program (RMP) includes extraction and storage of hydrocarbon liquid (liquid product).  The liquid product is stripped from natural gas, and stored under pressure in an abovegro"

In this other process natural gas is withdrawn from gathering system wells, compressed and delivered to a high-pressure transmission system.\n\n   Prior to delivery to the transmission system the natural gas is passed through extraction system vessels.  Water is removed and absorbed by ethylene glycol that is sprayed into, and later removed from, the gas stream. The extraction system process utilizes in series two counterflow heat exchangers, a chiller, and a three phase separator to reduce the gas temperature and induce the liquid product to drop out of the gas stream. The chiller system uses propane refrigerant in a closed loop which includes a compressor, a cooler (condenser), a receiver, the chiller (evaporator), and a suction drum. There is also a 300-gallon propane makeup tank, which feeds refrigerant to the closed loop as needed.  After forming in the three phase separator the liquid product is passed through the heat exchangers to cool the incoming gas, and then sent to a stabilizer vessel where ethane gas separates (ethane is piped to the natural gas compressor for use as a fuel) and moisture is removed. From the stabilizer the liquid product is piped to the 30,000-gallon storage tank.\n\n   The ethylene glycol dehydration system removes moisture from the gas stream and the liquid product stream in two loops. In the first loop, glycol is injected into the gas stream at both the first heat exchanger and the chiller, and it is later removed in the three-phase separator. In the second loop, glycol passes through the stabilizer to remove water from the liquid product. Both loops send the glycol through a reboiler (heats the glycol to drive off water) and then through a cooler if needed.\n\n   The storage system consists of fill piping, a 30,000-gallons storage tank and discharge pipe and hose for"

Any individual who works in this process must have extensive mechanical abilities, and is tested and evaluated operating procedures as part of the accident release prevention program.  Valves and other equipment are maintained, tested and replaced in-kind if necessary.  Maintenance is performed on compressors and process systems.   The operational systems have general monitoring, maintenance and inspection performed periodically to ensure satisfactory performance.  Maintenance procedures are currently being reviewed, and will soon be updated.\n                                                                                                                                                                                              This facility normally runs continuously while operations personnel conduct system checks twice per day, Monday through Friday.

The standard operational procedure is to maintain the liquid product storage tank at less than sixty-percent of its total capacity, approximately 18,000 gallons.  The storage tank is inspected daily to determine the amount of material present.  To maintain this sixty- percent total volume a truckload of the liquid product is shipped every one to two weeks. Each shipment consists of approximately 8,500 gallons of liquid product per trip from the facility.  The transport company, McIlvane Trucking Inc, follows specific written operational procedures for transferring liquid product from the storage tank to the tanker truck.  There are spring loaded shut-off valves in the transfer piping to prevent potential releases related to transfer accidents.\n\n   There is also minimal risk from accidental motor vehicle accidents involving the liquid product storage tank.  Concrete Jersey barriers surround it, and access to the facility is normally through locked gates.   Any visitors must check in with the site operations personnel to gain access.\n\n7) Five Year Accident History:\n  \n   To date this facility has had no releases of liquid product, or other related incidents, which caused off-site injuries, public evacuations, or any instances where personnel, the public, or the environment have been placed in danger from the extraction/storage process.\n\n8) Emergency Response Program:\n  \n   There is a National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation wide written Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes procedures, requirements and recommendations for the control of emergency occurrences including, but not limited to natural gas leaks, fires, accidents or injuries.  This Emergency Response Plan is intended to establish a controlled and orderly means of response and control of emergencies in order to avoid unnecessary panic, injury, or death.  D"
