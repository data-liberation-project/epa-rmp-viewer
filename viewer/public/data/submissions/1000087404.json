The quantity of butane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal's regulated butane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Storage and Handling, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including Wisconsin's Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) LPG System requirements, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  The Wisconsin DSPS has approved the installation of the system.   If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Green Bay Metro Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Brown County Emergency Management as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.\n\n\n\nU.S. Oil has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of several locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Green Bay Metro Fire Department (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.4 miles) and request their assistance (via 911).  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Green Bay Metro Fire Department and Brown County Emergency Management.\n\n \n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged within 20 seconds, CEC (Terminal Security "

If there is no answer at the on-call phone number to confirm whether help is needed, CEC will than contact the next terminal employee in line to receive a call.  CEC will continue calling terminal employees until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation (they will not leave a voice message).\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Oil Fox River Terminal has conducted facility tours with the Green Bay Metro Fire Department which included educating members of the fire department on the hazards of butane, evacuation plans, and assembly points.\n\n\n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives:\n\n1. Safety of clients, servicers, and community,\n\n2. Up time performance and user experience and,\n\n3. Site cost drivers and reductions through root cause analysis and long term corrective/preventive actions.\n\n\n\nWhile uptime and site costs goals are easily quantifiable, Safety is paramount to U.S. Venture as this establishes our credibility and reputation with employees, communities, and the industry.\n\n\n\nSafety and Environmental compliance are of primary importance to U.S. Venture at all times."
