The analysis are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the Ethylene Storage Complex for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineer?s work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Ethylene Underground Storage Facility, operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n?Steps for safely conducting activities\n?Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n?Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n \nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal "
