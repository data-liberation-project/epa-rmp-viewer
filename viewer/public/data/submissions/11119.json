This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant, located in Velma Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., Y grade mixture) from natural gas. The Texaco Velma Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including: \nPropane\nButane\nIsoPentane\nPentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 290,000 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in a single vessel. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in "

The release is expected to be isolated by plant operations personnel within 15 minutes. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the ARS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. This event was selected to as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and action.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant. Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Safety, Health and Environmental Representative is assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in an operators procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and"

The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n \nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n(1) initial startup\n(2) normal startup\n(3) normal operations\n(4) temporary operations\n(5) consequences of deviation\n(6) normal shutdown\n(7) emergency shutdown\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTraining\n \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texaco Velma Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify/demonstrate (e.g., via performance review, skills demonstration and written tests.) that the operator understood the training.]\n \nContractors\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

A management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\n \nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Texaco Velma Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n \nSafe Work Practices\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:\n(1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel\n(2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance \n(3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened\n(4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work)\n(5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help pe"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\n(1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \nIncident Investigation\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \nCompliance Audits\n \nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning"

      "SummaryText": " properly, the Texaco Velma Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nThe processes at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n \nUniversal Prevention Activities\n \nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Texaco Velma Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \nSpecialized Safety Features\n \nThe Texaco Velma Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help:\n(1) contain/control a release\n(2) quickly detect a release, and\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \n \nRelease Detection\n 1. Hydrocarbon and hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\n \nRelease Containment/Control\n \n 1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n 2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n 3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high  temperature)\n 4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n 5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power su"
