      "SummaryText": "Please see attached document.\n1.1 BACKGROUND\n\nMirant Delta, LLC (Mirant) owns and operates Pittsburg Power Plant (PPP), an electric power generating facility located in West Pittsburg, California in Contra Costa County. There are seven existing units at PPP: Units 1-4 which have been retired and Units 5-7 which continue to operate for electric power generation.  Units 5 and 6 are each rated at 325 MW and Unit 7 is rated at 720 MW.  The boilers for Units 5 and 6 were manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox and the boiler for Unit 7 was manufactured by Combustion Engineering. \n\nMirant has retrofitted the existing Units 5 and 6 at PPP with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as required to comply with Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 11, \"Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Electric Power Generating Steam Boilers\".  Mirant completed the retrofit of Unit 6 with an SCR system in February of 2002 and completed the retrofit of Unit 5 with an SCR system in June of 2002.  At the time that the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems were designed and constructed, Mirant had planned to also retrofit Unit 7 with a SCR system.  Since that time, the project to retrofit Unit 7 with a SCR system has been cancelled.  This document addresses the aqueous ammonia systems that are associated with the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems.\n\nThe SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from the generating units. The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 29.4% by weight. This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both California and federal regulations.\n\nIn order to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was established in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The California Office of Emergency Services established the California Accidental Relea"

The CalARP Program specifies the regulated substances, oversees the federal requirements, and determines the requirements for the preparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and offsite accidental release consequence analysis. In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD).\n\nWith the addition of the SCR systems, the quantity of aqueous ammonia that is stored and used at Pittsburg Power Plant is greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities; therefore, a RMP is required. As shown in this RMP, a worst-case release from the PPP aqueous ammonia system would cause the toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia (200yppmv) to occur offsite, in an area of Suisun Bay to which the public has access. Therefore, the process cannot be classified as Program 1. Although, aqueous ammonia is listed as a regulated substance in Section 2770.5 of CalARP regulations, the power generation industry is not specifically required to submit extensive Program 3 RMP requirements, and the CCCHSD has determined that the risk posed by this process does not justify classifying the process as Program 3. Accordingly, this process qualifies for a Program 2 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations. In order to fulfill the Program 2 requirements, the following actions were completed:\n\n* Analyze a worst-case and alternative release scenario and provide offsite consequence analysis.\n\n* Describe the site's accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Ensure that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.\n\n* Describe the site's safety program.\n\n* Describe the site's hazard review program.\n\n* Describe the site's operating procedures.\n\n* Describe the site's training programs"

The organization of the RMP follows that provided in the Contra Costa County CalARP Program Guidance Document.\n\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nMirant is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. It is the policy of Mirant to conduct business in a manner that protects the environment and the safety and health of the public and its employees by: \n\n* Meeting all environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements.\n\n* Seeking to ensure that environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements are based on sound science and cost-effective technology. \n\n* Pursuing opportunities to enhance the quality of the environment. \n\n* Promoting public and employee understanding of environmental issues and the company's environmental activities. \n\n* Establishing company and organizational environmental goals and implementation plans. \n\n* Ensuring that employees are aware of their individual roles and responsibilities in implementation of this environmental policy.\n\nA copy of Mirant's Environmental Policy can be found in Appendix A of the RMP located at the facility.

In an effort to continue to improve the environmental, safety and health performance and to minimize accidental releases, numerous environmental, safety and health programs are implemented at PPP along with on-going personnel training activities that are described in Section 1.7.1 and 1.7.4 respectively of this RMP. The release prevention programs implemented in conjunction with this RMP strengthens the existing environmental, safety and health programs at PPP. \n\n\n\n1.3 STORAGE AND HANDLING OF REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe only federal and CalARP regulated substance that is stored and handled onsite at PPP is aqueous ammonia, which is used in the SCR systems to reduce NOx emissions from Unit 5 and Unit 6.. In the SCR systems, aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tanks, to a vaporizer, which produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia that is then mixed with the flue gas from the boiler and passed over a reducing catalyst to reduce the NOx emissions from the stack exhaust. \n\n\n\n1.3.1 Ammonia Systems\n\nThe systems that handle aqueous ammonia at PPP are the aqueous ammonia storage facility, the aqueous ammonia vaporization skid, and the ammonia injection grid/SCR reactor. \n\n\n\n1.3.1.1 Aqueous Ammonia Storage Facility\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage facility consists of a truck unloading station and three aqueous ammonia storage tanks. The storage facility has been designed and constructed to receive and store aqueous ammonia for three different SCR systems: the retrofitted Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems and a planned SCR system for Unit 7 that has not been installed.  At the present time, the aqueous ammonia storage tanks for the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems are in service.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank that was installed for the Unit 7 SCR system is currently empty.  The aqueous ammonia storage facility is located near the northern portion of the developed property of the Pittsburg Power Plant, immediately to the west of Unit 7.\n\nThe storage facil"

      "SummaryText": "ity that currently services the SCR systems for Unit 5 and Unit 6 includes three 21,200-gallon capacity carbon steel storage tanks that are approximately 10 feet in diameter and 38 feet long.  The effective maximum volume of each storage tank is limited to 20,000 gallons through administrative controls which include operating procedures that require a check of the storage tank level prior to filling the tank to confirm that the tank has sufficient free volume to accept the ammonia delivery without exceeding 20,000 gallons.  All tanks have been designed and constructed in compliance with Uniform Building Code Seismic Zone 4, Uniform Fire Code Article 80, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII, Division 1, 'U' Stamp, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels. The tanks have a maximum design pressure and temperature of 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and 110F, respectively.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tanks are supported horizontally on concrete foundations within a walled containment basin approximately 65 feet long by 55 feet wide that slopes to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks and running the length of the containment area. This sump is 14 feet wide by 55 feet long and 7 feet deep and provides a volume sufficient to hold 145 percent of the contents of the largest ammonia storage tank, plus the maximum rainfall recorded in the Pittsburg area in 24 hours in the past 43 years (3.03 inches, WRCC 1955-1998). Although the sump has been sized to accommodate rainfall in accordance with the applicable codes, a sump pump has been provided to keep it free of rainwater. The sump pump is interlocked with the ammonia monitoring system so that it does not operate if ammonia vapors are detected.\n\nAqueous ammonia is delivered to Pittsburg Power Plant via tanker truck. Individual tanker trucks can transport up to 6,500 gallons of aqueous ammonia. The containment area for the unloading area is sized to contain 105 per"

Each storage tank has an unloading station consisting of an ammonia fill line, where aqueous ammonia is fed from the delivery truck to the tank, and a vapor return line where vapor pressure between the tank and the truck is equalized. \n\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Aqueous Ammonia Vaporization Skid\n\nAqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to spray nozzles inside the ammonia vaporizer unit that is mounted on the vaporizer skid located near the SCR reactor. The spray droplets are then mixed with a hot air diluent stream in the vaporizer to evaporate the ammonia. The vaporizer produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia in the diluent stream. The diluent stream is then transported to the injection grid.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is pumped through 3/4 inch stainless steel piping from the storage tank to the SCR injection grid.  All electric forwarding pumps and associated piping are located within the walled storage tank containment area. The piping between the storage tank containment area and the nearest edge of the Unit 7 building is contained in a covered trench located under the road and parking area to protect the piping from vehicular traffic. The trench under the road that houses the aqueous ammonia piping drains into the sump under the aqueous ammonia storage tanks in the containment area. In addition, the primary piping is contained within larger diameter PVC piping for all stretches that are not within the storage facility containment area or in the trench under the road, per the request of the Contra Costa Consolidated Fire District (CCCFD). Therefore, secondary containment is provided for all sections of aqueous ammonia piping.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Ammonia Injection Grid / SCR\n\nThe ammonia injection grid provides additional mixing of the diluent stream and transports it to the SCR.

This allows more thorough mixing of the ammonia-laden diluent stream with the turbulent flue gas from the boiler. Although the oxidation-reduction reaction is initiated by the injection of ammonia at the injection grid, all of the reaction is completed in the SCR reactor by passing the mixture over a catalyst composed primarily of titanium and vanadium oxides. The treated flue gas, containing small amounts of residual NOX and excess ammonia, is discharged out the stack.\n\nThe SCR process is controlled with feed-forward and feedback control loops. An upstream NOX analyzer measures the NOX concentration at the SCR reactor inlet. A downstream analyzer measures the total NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet. The ammonia demand signal, which regulates the rate at which aqueous ammonia is pumped to the vaporizer, is determined from the readings of both NOx analyzers.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Aqueous Ammonia Hazards\n\nThe aqueous ammonia solution that is used for the SCR systems at PPP is 29.4 percent ammonia by weight, with the balance of the weight being water. Aqueous ammonia is a corrosive material although the degree of danger associated with the substance is considered minor. Ammonia is not a known carcinogen, but it poses acute and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards to the respiratory system and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards as skin irritations or other effects. Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\n\nThough there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution, the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound that is also used for SCR systems.

Incident investigations are also conducted for near misses that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a hazardous material or a potential injury or illness.  The primary purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying root causes of the incident, and to develop and implement corrective actions to prevent the incident or similar incidents from reoccurring.  Incident reports are distributed to all Mirant facilities in order to reduce repeat occurrences and to share the lessons learned.  The incident investigation program at PPP is beneficial to release prevention by ensuring that any incident or potential incident will not be repeated, thus reducing the chance of future incidents.\n\nAll incidents requiring an investigation, including near miss incidents are reported immediately to the appropriate department supe"

If the ammonia evaporates from the solution, the ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few parts per million by volume (ppmv) and acutely toxic in high concentrations. A one-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals. \n\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ignition. Ammonia concentrations directly above an aqueous ammonia spill never approach these concentrations; therefore, aqueous ammonia has no explosive flammability potential.\n\n\n\n1.4 WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed to examine the significance of an accidental release of aqueous ammonia in a worst-case scenario and 2 slightly more realistic alternative scenarios.  \n\n\n\n1.5 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nMirant is dedicated to reducing any risks associated with the storage and handling of the aqueous ammonia for the SCR systems at PPP. To meet Mirant's strict goal of accident free operation, a management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the various RMP elements.  In this management system, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements. An organizational chart that shows the names and positions of those persons which have been assigned responsibility for implementing the individual RMP elements and defines the lines of authority is provided in Appendix C of the RMP located at the facility.

The aqueous ammonia storage tanks are enclosed within a walled containment basin that is sloped to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks that runs the length of the containment area. There is also a walled containment pad under the tanker truck unloading facility that drains rapidly into the covered sump under the tanks in the event of a spill.\n\nMany accident prevention safeguards have been implemented within the aqueous ammonia storage area. For example, in the event of a power outage, standby backup power needed for all required electrical systems, such as monitors and alarms, is provided by an Uninterruptable Power Supply. Also hot work permits are required for specific activities that present the potential for fire, and personnel involved in such operations receive appropriate training. \n\nOther safety features of the aqueous ammonia storage facility include: \n\n* Ammonia area monitoring system with audible and visible alarms,\n\n* Eyewash and shower station,\n\n* Piping and connections for washdown of containment basin with clean water,\n\n* Permanent lighting,\n\n* Lightning protection,\n\n* Truck barrier posts to protect ammonia tanks and delivery lines,\n\n* Liquid level indication and high-level alarm for each tank, easily visible from th"

In addition, area sensors have been installed in the aqueous ammonia storage facility area and near the ammonia vaporizer skid to monitor ambient ammonia concentrations. Alarms are designed to annunciate in the control room with local audible alarms for ammonia releases at the facilities.\n\nTo minimize impacts from accidental releases, workers have been trained in the safe handling of hazardous materials, use of response equipment, procedures for mitigation of a release, and coordination with local emergency response organizations. To avoid or minimize impacts from an accidental release of hazardous materials, nonhazardous or less hazardous materials is used, where possible, and engineering controls have been implemented.

The What-If checklist suggested events and conditions that could possibly lead to a release of aqueous ammonia from the new systems. The What-If checklist method of hazard review was selected for its versatility and simplicity. In addition, Dave Einolf of URS (who has facilitated many PHAs/Hazard Reviews using a What-If checklist) was available to facilitate the Hazard Review at the PPP and had developed a checklist specifically for ammonia storage, handling, and SCR processing. The What-If checklist was one of the hazard review methods suggested by the CCCHSD, and the CCCHSD approved the specific checklist prior to the hazard review. \n\nThe vast majority of these potential pitfalls described in the checklist were nullified by carefully planned design features of the new systems.

The two most recent compliance audit reports shall be retained onsite, though this does not apply to any compliance audit report that is more than five years old.\n\nThe developed compliance audit program satisfies the regulatory requirements of Section 2755.6 of the CalARP regulation. The compliance audit team training includes the imparting of a thorough understanding of the CalARP regulations and a review of the Guidance for Auditing Risk Management Plans/Programs. Although this guidance is intended for regulators, the checklist in Annex C of the Guidance document is followed. The compliance audits shall be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.\n\nTo ensure that all aspects of the RMP program have been implemented correctly, two different audit programs have been implemented, as described below:\n\n* Mirant Compliance Audit Program - Mirant's corporate office from Atlanta, GA performs periodic environmental, safety and health audits. The purpose of these audits is to assess the overall adequacy of the environmental, safety and health management system and to provide reasonable assurance of compliance wi"

Depending on the severity and complexity of the incident additional employees with specific knowledge of and experience with the design, operation and/or maintenance of the process will participate in the investigation.  Contract employees will also participate in the investigation if they were involved in the incident.  If the incident involves a recordable incident, or a serious or fatal injury or illness, the Safety and Health department representative also performs an investigation. The determination as to the seriousness of the incident is left to the discretion of the Safety and Health representative. \n\nThe department supervisor or delegated employee that is leading the investigation is required to initiate the incident investigation as soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours after the incident has occurred.  At the conclusion of the investigation, a written summary of the investigation is prepared on an Incident Report form.  A sample Incident Report form can be found in Appendix F of the RMP located at the facility.  This report form includes the date of the incident, a description of the incident, corrective actions taken, the root cause(s) and other factors contributing to the incident, and recommendations from the investigation to prevent recurrence.  The Incident Reports are retained on site for a minimum of five years. \n\nThe Plant Manager determines what actions are to be taken to prevent recurrence of future incidents of this type.  The Plant Manager is responsible for implementing these actions and for informing all employees, including contractors who are affected by the recommendation and findings of the investigation.\n\n\n\n1.8 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past 5 years at the facility there have been no accidents involving regulated substances or other extremely hazardous subs"

An external boiler waterwall tube ruptured on the north side of the Unit 5 boiler. The pressure of the steam exiting the tube penetrated the boiler insulation and siding, releasing steam containing asbestos particles from the insulation material. A small amount of asbestos containing material was deposited in the area northeast of the plant. This area included a small park just across the northeast plant boundary, and the western portion of the Pittsburg Marina. Most of the material remained onsite. All impacted areas onsite and offsite were appropriately cleaned. The Community Warning System was activated, though no evacuation or sheltering-in-place was required. There were no injuries or fatalities due to this incident. As a result of this incident, a failure analysis was performed to determine the root cause of the boiler tube failure. Also, an aggressive boiler tube inspection program was implemented and as a result of the inspections, waterwall tube sections of the boiler were replaced. The boiler tube inspections are ongoing.\n\nSince the change of ownership at PPP, accidents have been avoided by adhering to the safety and environmental programs listed in Section 1.7.1, continually improving the personnel safety training program and adhering to a strict maintenance program for all equipment involved with the storage and handling of hazardous substances. \n\n\n\n1.9 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPPP has coordinated emergency response programs with the CCCHSD and the CCCFD. Periodically, the fire department inspects the facilities that store and handle flammable hazardous materials at PPP to ensure that the applicable Uniform Fire Co"

The CCCFD visits PPP approximately once per year to practice a simulated emergency at the plant in order to ensure timely, effective, safe response plans.\n\nIn the unlikely event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance, PPP utilizes an alphanumeric paging system as its primary emergency notification system for all onsite personnel. The system provides written information regarding the emergency. If the release could result in an offsite public health concern, the emergency coordinator or incident commander shall notify Contra Costa County officials to determine if the community warning system (CWS) should be activated. All community notifications, whether initiated manually or automatically, are coordinated with the CCCFD. \n\nThe above notification procedures are explained in detail in the Facility Emergency Plan along with procedures for minimizing the impact of an incident, appropriate response activities for each hazardous substance onsite, and the phone numbers to contact both on and offsite emergency response personnel. The section of the Facility Emergency Plan addressing the aqueous ammonia has been included in Appendix G of the RMP located at the facility. The Facility Emergency Plan is updated and employees are retrained as new substances or emergency procedures are implemented at the PPP facility and an update log is maintained within the Plan. \n\nPPP personnel that can respond to an incidental release have successfully completed training in respiratory protection, hazard communication, Emergency Action Plan, use of personal protective equipment and decontamination procedures.\n\n\n\n1.10 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTo continue operating a safe, accident-free facility, the safety features described in previous sections of this document have been implemented during the construction of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling facilities.
