Our RMP program includes\n\nelements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\n\npoints in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\n\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\n\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\n\nrefrigeration system to identify the\n\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\n\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\n\nrefrigeration equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\n\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\n\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\n\nof the refrigeration system.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are\n\nscreened to verify that they are within the original safe design\n\nlimits.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we\n\nconduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new\n\nequipment has been designed and ins"
