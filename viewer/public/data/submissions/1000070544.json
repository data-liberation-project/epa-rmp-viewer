The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances. The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Chisholm Trail Gas Complex which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is the NGL Surge Tank, which contains a flammable mixture of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), primarily propane.  This vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and have offsite consequences.  In order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, any inventory of regulated toxic substances is maintained below the threshold quantity.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex has primarily used the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of Blue Mountain Midstream personnel and/or contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This PHA (Process Hazards Analysis) Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings/recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval/revision, and the final resolution of the action tasks will be documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) initial unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the Chisholm Trail Plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

Maintenance personnel receive training on the following to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner:\n\n?    Process overview;\n\n?    Safety and health hazards;\n\n?    Applicable maintenance procedures;\n\n?    Emergency response plans; and\n\n?    Applicable safe work practices.\n\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equ"

The Chisholm Trail Gas Complex incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include:\n\n?    Control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\n\n?    A lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\n\n?    A procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened;\n\n?    A permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and\n\n?    A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThe Chisholm Trail Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to inco"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Chisholm Gas Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Gas Complex periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n1.6 ?68.155(f) Safety Improvements\n\nThe Chisholm Trail Gas Complex places high priority in resolving findings and recommendations from PHAs, safety audi"
