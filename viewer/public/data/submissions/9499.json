It is the policy of the Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative operates a sugar beet processing and refining facility in Wahpeton, Richland County, North Dakota.  The facility's principal products are beet sugar, beet pulp pellets and molasses by-products.  The sugar beet refining process requires the use of sulfur dioxide to control pH and color.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored on-site is estimated to be 130,000 pounds.  The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquid and is vaporized via an evaporator for process usage.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe EPA definition of the worst-case scenario is the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in a 10-minute period.  The purpose of analyzing the worst case release is to determine the facility's RMP program level eligibility, and to provide for a consistent yardstick from facility to facility to level the playing field.  The worst case release scenario for the sulfur dioxide system is the loss of the entire tank content of 130,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  For a number of reasons, including the thermodynamic properties of liquid sulfur dioxide, this is an extremely improbable and technically infeasible scenario.  The conditions of the worst case scenario are prescribed by EPA requirements.  It is important to remember that this type of release sceario would require the occurance of a catastrophic event, or series of events, which have a very low likelihood of ever happening.  The EPA look-up table, Exhibit 4-6, in Section 4.1 of the Risk Management Program Gui"

According to the Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR) receptor report 0374861.1r dated May 28, 1999, the estimated population within the 25 mile radius is 30,600 people.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe alternate case scenario is defined by the EPA as a release that is significantly more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  For the Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative facility, this release was modeled as a one-inch diameter (0.785 square inches) hole on the liquid side of the sulfur dioxide system.  The EPA look-up table, Exhibit 4-16, in section 4.2 of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants document indicates a 1,600 pounds per minute release rate and a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.9 miles.  According to the EDR offsite receptor report 0374867.1r dated May 28, 1999 and generated for the Minn-Dak Yeast Company, Inc. (located adjacent to the Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative) there is a population of 2300 people within a 2.5 mile radius of the site.  This translates to a population density of 117 people per square mile.  The estimated population within the 1.9 mile radius is 1300 people.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, the Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative has not had a sulfur dioxide accident causing death injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering in"
