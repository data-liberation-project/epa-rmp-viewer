There are a total of four screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. There is a total of four compressors. There is one swing compressor that can operate on the high or low temperature system. There are three additional compressors that operate on the low temperature system with side porting capability to the high temperature system.   \n\nThere are two separate recirculator packages: one low temperature system operating at -22\u00b0F and a high temperature unit operating at +22\u00b0F.  The low temperature recirculator package feeds fourteen evaporator units. The high temperature recirculator unit feeds the four dock units.  Hot gas defrost is employed for daily defrosting chores.\n\nThere is two rooftop mounted evaporative condenser with a remote sump.  There is also two glycol shell and tube units use for under floor heating.

The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves Condenser unit EC-1 via a two 2 1/2-inch pipes and flows to the thermosyphon header and the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1).  \n\nThe Thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid to each screw compressor for cooling of the oil.
