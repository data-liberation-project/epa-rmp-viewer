      "SummaryText": "The owners, management and employees of Moultrie Grain Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the fire department and LEPC so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact.\n\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia is distributed as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored is 140,000.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 lbs which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to endpoint is 2.5 miles.\n\nThe alternate case scenario would be a release from the rupture of the 1.5 inch transfer hose with 12,000 lbs released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is .5 miles.\n\nThis facility complies with the rules and regulations related to the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia as administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture.  These rules are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910l.111\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at this facility for the past five years.\n\nThis facility has a written emergency response plan and provides the state and local authorities with this information as required by law.  Our emergency response plan has been reviewede with the local fire department and LEPC.\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance and safe operations.  There are no specific ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
