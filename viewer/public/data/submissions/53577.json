      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nSuperior Pipeline Company, LLC. (SPC) owns and operates a natural gas liquids recovery facility, the Cashion Gas Processing Plant, in Cashion, Oklahoma. The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, refrigeration, and expansion. Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas.  Section 112(r ) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Cashion plant because it handles and stores process flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities. SPC management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  The Cashion plant has no recordable accidents in the past five years.   \n\nSPC has considered the impact of a worst case accident.  In this case, the \u00bfworst case\u00bf would be a complete release from the 15,000 gallon NGL storage tank, resulting in instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes. Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the potential radius of impact, due to the explosion, was calculated to extend 0.3 miles. Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 1 mile radius.  The worst case event would affect two (2) nearby structures, and it was determined that the nearest public receptor is approximately 0.3 miles from the tank.  A consideration of the 0.3 mile radius is incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nSPC implements safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are being implemented.  In addition, SPC has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Cashion Volunteer Fire Department, and the Local"

To estimate the hole size, SPC assumes, for example, the hole size that would result from shearing off a valve or pipe from a process line containing a regulated substance. To estimate the gas leak, the following simplified equation was used to estimate a release rate based on hole size, pipe pressure, and the properties of the gas. This equation applies to choked flow, or maximum gas flow rate. Choked flow generally would be expected for gases under pressure.\n\nQR = HA x Pt x 1/vTt x GF \n\nTo summarize, a pipe containing methane gas is broken.  Methane gas was chosen due to the fact that it has the highest heat of combustion of any element in the process stream.  The release rate was estimated from the above equation. We estimate that the broken pipe would leave a hole with an area (HA) of 6 square inches. The temperature inside the pipe (T, absolute temperature, Kelvin) is 282 K, the air temperature is assumed to be 25 degrees C, and the square root of the temperature T is 16.8. The pressure in the pipe (P) is approximately 750 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). From Exhibit C-2, Appendix C, of EPA 550-B-99-009, the gas factor (GF) for methane is 14. Therefore,"
