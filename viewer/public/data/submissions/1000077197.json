These codes do not contain requirements regarding ammonia detection. Fortunately, a standalone detector is located inside the machinery room and was helpful in assessing the incident. The recently published ANSI/IIAR 9-2020 is the Standard for Minimum System Safety Requirements\nfor Existing Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Although facilities have nearly five years to evaluate and implement IIAR 9, consider upgrading the machinery room detection to meet IIAR 9. This includes: 1) an alarm that reports to a monitored location so that corrective action can be taken; 2) audible and visual alarms inside the room and outside of each entrance to the machinery room. See section 7.3.12 of IIAR 9 and the following blog on the topic, https://bit.ly/2BD2q3W .\n\n5. Some documentation from Mechanical Integrity (MI) inspections included typos and unclear information.

The accident occurred at approximately 7:25 am. The accident occurred on Plant 2.1, Compressor 3, when the High Stage Suction (HSS) strainer gasket failed. Upon investigation, two of the four bolts on the strainer cap were broken.\n\nThe duration of the release was five hours. The amount of ammonia released was estimated to be 5,461 lbs. Businesses and households near the facility were instructed to shelter-in-place. Reedley Fire Department stated that there were no reported injuries or complaints over the five hours of the incident.\nWithin 21 minutes of the incident the local CUPA, 911, CalOES, and the National Response Center were notified. An investigation was performed and the following recommendations were made:\n\n1. Upon investigation, one of the four bolts on the strainer cap was broken and missing for years. This was identified by APCCO (contractor) in writing in early 2020. However, Wawona Packing Company LLC - Plant 2's refrigeration department had yet to act on that recommendation. Ensure to prioritize Mechanical Integrity recommendations based on severity. Critical items that could lead to accidental releases must be addressed immediately.\n\n2. It is unknown what caused the bolts to break before and during the incident. One possibility is that the bolts were over-torqued after the strainer was cleaned in the past. The suction strainer bolts on similar compressors could also be weak. Ensure to check the suction strainer bolts on Plant 2.1 compressors. Replace any suspect bolts and torque to manufacturer's specifications.\n\n3. Communication between Wawona Packing Company LLC - Plant 2, emergency responders and contractors was good. However, the investigation team identified improvements on the following topics: 1) authorization to call the hazmat team for response; 2) communication between Wawona Pa"
