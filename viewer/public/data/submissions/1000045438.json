Contract employers must provide employee training and information concerning hazards, ensure that employees follow the employer's safety rules, and alert the employer to hazards discovered during work or presented by the work the contract employees are performing.

The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperatures of Milk, Cream, and Ice Cream at 514 Division Street Madison, WI 53704.  Ammonia, a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, is used in an anhydrous form liquefied under pressure in a two stage process.  The refrigeration system consists of a High Pressure Receiver, Evaporators, Compressors, Condensers, Vessels, Piping and numerous types of Valves.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \r\nSchoep's Ice Cream Company is dedicated to promoting safe handling of hazardous materials for the sake of the Plant, Employees and Surrounding Community.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of federal regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained in such a way as to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  Also, these programs ensure the development of procedures that serve to minimize the impact of releases in the event that they do occur, as well as outlining proper emergency response steps.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nAs a part of its desire to promote the safety of its employees and the surrounding community, Schoep's Ice Cream Co. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  Predominate among these programs is process safety management; PSM is organized into 14 elements. (Addressed in the same order as they are presented in the regulatory requirements.)\r\nElement 1-Employee Participation: PSM must involve"

A formal incident investigation must be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia. For the purpose of this guideline, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion involving ammonia that presents serious danger to employees, the employees of contractors working on site, or to off-site neighbors. Schoep's approach goes beyond the minimum requirements (because small occurrences can lead to larger ones), and Schoep's wants to learn/improve from our experiences. \r\nSpecific procedures that are followed to develop and maintain Schoep's incident investigation procedures are contained in Element 11, Incident Investigation.\r\nElement 12 -Emergency Planning and Response: Written emergency response plans are required for all ammonia refrigeration facilities.  Facilities must designate at least one plant contact to interface with emergency responders. The emergency planning and response guidelines contain the emergency action plan requirements and the essential steps necessary to initiate, conduct, and terminate an emergency response action. \r\nSpecific procedures that are followed to develop and maintain Schoep's emergency response plans are contained in Element 12, Emergency Planning and Response.

Self-auditing is a cost effective, instructive, and positive approach to improving the safety of a process provided that the auditors are impartial to the process and management actively pursues implementation of audit recommendations. It is also a process that ensures continuous improvement is being made in safely operating and managing the Ammonia refrigeration systems at Schoep's facilities. The steps involved in conducting a compliance audit are: \u00bf Define the Audit Requirements \u00bfPrepare for the Audit \u00bf Conduct the Audit \u00bfReport on the Audit Findings \u00bf Follow Up on the Audit Findings \r\nSpecific procedures that are followed to develop and maintain Schoep's compliance audit program are contained in Element 13, Compliance Audits.\r\nElement 14 - Trade Secrets: Subject to the rules in the HazCom Standard, employees and their representatives shall have access to trade secret information in PHAs and other documents required by the PSM Standard. The employer may, however, require employees to execute confidentiality agreements providing that trade secrets will not be disclosed.\r\nSchoep's trade secrets policy is defined in Element 14, Trade Secrets.\r\nPSM Standard Maintenance: The Process Safety Management (PSM) program is an evergreen system.  As described above the program has 14 PSM Elements, where each element contains various information in the form of electronic and paper (hard copy) files/documents.  The information in the PSM program must be kept current and accurate to comply with OSHA regulations. \r\nFacility Management Responsibilities:\tFacility management, specifically the President, is ultimately responsible for the safety of the employees, contractors, and the surrounding population.  Implementation of the PSM Standard is designed to reduce the risk to employees, contractors, a"

To ensure proper implementation of the PSM Standard, the Facility Management will assign a PSM Coordinator.\r\nPSM Coordinator Responsibilities: It is the responsibility of the PSM Coordinator to ensure the PSM program is fully implemented and kept current.  The PSM Coordinator will steward the implementation of the 14 PSM Elements and report deficiencies to Facility Management and appropriate personnel.  Typical tasks the PSM Coordinator will perform include: \u00bfSchedule and coordinate Process Hazard Analysis. \u00bfFacilitate certification of the Operating Procedures. \u00bfEnsure training records are maintained for affected and authorized employees. \u00bfEnsure annual review of ammonia refrigeration contractor qualifications (training and safety records). \u00bfEnsure pre-startup safety reviews are completed, documented, and filed. \u00bfEnsure ammonia refrigeration maintenance tests and inspections are performed to standard and documented properly. \u00bfFacilitate the management of change process and ensure all documentation and training is complete prior to implementation of the change. \u00bfCoordinate PSM incident investigations and ensure recommendations are implemented in a timely manner. \u00bf Coordinate PSM compliance audits and ensure recommendations are implemented in a timely manner.\r\nSchoep's Management Responsibilities: \tSchoep's Management will support the PSM Coordinator and the Facility Management as needed to implement the PSM Standard.  To ensure the PSM Standard if fully implemented, Schoep's Management will help plan the PSM compliance audits and track progress on recommendations as needed.  Schoep's Management will also promote the implementation of best practices to ensure employees have the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools.  \r\nAdditionally, Schoep's continues its refinement of an existing ammonia control system to increase the overall safety of the refrigeration system by augmenting the system's ability to monitor, report, and mitigate accid"

Written procedures are required for start-up, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. The operating procedures are required to address operating limits, including the consequences of deviations, steps to correct and/or avoid deviations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures also address safety and health considerations regarding the process, including the properties and hazards of the chemicals used, the precautions necessary to prevent exposure, control measures to be taken if contact or exposure to the chemical occurs, and any special or unique hazards (such as high noise levels).
