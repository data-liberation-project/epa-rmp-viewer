ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nAmerchol Corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Carbide Corporation, is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Amerchol's Responsible Care requirements and governmental rerquirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's [EPA] Risk Management Program [RMP] rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's [OSHA] Process Safety Management [PSM] standard, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act [TCPA] regulations.\n\n2.  DESCRIPTION  OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES. \n\nThe Amerchol Corporation plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces approximately ten millon pounds of speciality chemical products for use primarily in the personal care industry.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Amerchol plant, has a specific amount [threshold] or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Amerchol plant has two RMP regulated toxic substances; ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.  The Amerchol plant has no RMP regulated flammable substances.\n\n3.   KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS.\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occ"
