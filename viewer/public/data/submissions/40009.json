      "SummaryText": "The City of Tifton's Water and Wastewater Department has implemented a Risk Management Plan for the safe handling and storage of chlorine. This plan involves procedures, technologies and management practices to monitor and control any potential release of chlorine to the atmosphere. The action of this plan will minimize hazards and risks of any accidental chlorine release. We have implemented all aspects of 40 CFR 68.170 of the Code of Federal Regulations into this plan, so to protect the safety of our employees, public health and all agencies in our community and environment from all possible hazards.\n\nThe Tifton Regional Wastewater Treatment Complex utilizes chlorine to disinfect processed effluent water before this water is discharged into New River, located on U.S. Highway 82 East.We use this chlorine to treat our potable water source. We store filled 150 lb tanks and (1) ton chlorine cylinders at this facility to be used in our treatment processes. We are located east of U.S. 319 North and north of U.S. 82 east at 80 Old Brookfield Road in Tift County.\n\nWe maintain operational personnel on site 24 hours a day every day of the year with emergency response personnel on call should any problem occur in maintenance and operational. Equipment is maintained and operated by staff personnel who are trained in all procedures, safety, operation of this equipment and will respond to any emergency if required. Operations, inspections, and safety devices are checked and a log on a continous basis on all shifts as to maintain integrity of all units and devices. Chlorine equipment, piping, pumps and alarms are checked (4) times per eight hour shift with (3) shifts per 24 hour period.\n\nThe City of Tifton Water and Wastewater Operations has developed an accidental release model to determine potential consequence with failures in our operation processes resulting in chlorine release. There are (2) scenarios used and defined by the EPA as Follows:\n\"Worse Case\"  \"The owner or oper"

This worst case senario is likely to occur.\n\"Alternative Case\"  defined by the EPA states \"more likey to occur than the worst-case release\"\n\nThe above cases are the downwind distances for the toxic end point for this regulated substance under EPA's RMP (Risk Management Plan) Rule 112r. The above endpoint calculations were estimated using RMP COMP from EPD. This plan is on site at all emergency response agencies, law enforcement, Department of Transportation, EPA, EPD and the Tifton Regional Treatment Complex. Joint chlorine training courses are planned throughout the year with all agencies involved in emergency response for any chlorine release.\n07/26/2004\n\nJanuary 09, 2002 Sowega Chlorinator changed out the Tifton Regional Wastewater Atreatment Complex chlorinators and piping. We replaced the old Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/day with Superior ASO 500 lbs/day system. Jimmy Knowles of Sowega from Alabany GA, covered operation, maintenance, and safety on these new units. Present for this training were: Wyman Temples, Roy Engram, Earl Humphrey, James Yount, Elijah Thomas, Harold Sumner, John Holmes and Jerry Simmons.01/09/2002\n\nElijah Thomas completed training on above Chlorination System with the following personnel: Albert Coburn, Mike Stevens, Ricky Johnson, Randall Lott, Anthony West, Cordell Griffin, Jerry West, Donald Pate, Jesse Hill, Michael Chumley, Anthony Finch, Thomas Coker, Michael Carter, Larry Bentley, and DeBryan Davis. 06/04/2004"
