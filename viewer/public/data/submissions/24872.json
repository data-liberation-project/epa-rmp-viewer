If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.    The primary activity at this location is the storage and mixing of fertilizers for sale to Retail Agriculture Dealers and farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and mixed into 10-34-00 fertilizer.  This operation takes place twice a year, normally early spring and in the fall.   This mixing operation is performed by a T-Reactor.  The T-Reactor process is a method of producing fertilizer composed of nitrogen and phosphorous.  The nitrogen is supplied to the process in the form on anhydrous ammonia.  Phosphorous is supplied as liquid superphosphoric acid.  Water is the other raw material and is used as a stablilizer to produce, standard grades of commercial fertilizer.  The standard grades produced by this process are 10-34-00 and 11-37-00.  The maximum  quantity of anhydrous ammonia on hand during the blending operation would be approximately 78,000 pounds.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the bulk storage tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.90 mile.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO: a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shot-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shot-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity release would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.60 mile.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has i"

The facility has in place Standard Safe Operating Procedures for T-Reactor Process which all employees have been trained to follow.\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  EMERENCY ACTION PLAN.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n8.  PLANNED CHAGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess our prevention and safety programs.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations at this time.\n\n9.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\n     Cliff Daugherty, Manager\n     United Suppliers, Inc.\n     P. O.
