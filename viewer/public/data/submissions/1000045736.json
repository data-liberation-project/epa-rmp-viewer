It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Everly Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Clay County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary on site emergency coordinator for the Everly, Iowa location is Harvey Lyman, Operations  Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided below. In addition to the corporate emergency contact indicated in Section 1, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n\n\n                      Harvey Lyman, operations manager\n\n                               WORK:    (712) 834-2238\n\n                               24-Hour:   (712) 240-0321\n\n                               Cellular:    (712) 240-6771\n\n\n\n                     Chuck Selzer\n\n                               WORK:"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is three (3).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) storage tank when full.  Full is considered 85% of the tank's capacity.  This scenario would result in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 5.6 miles. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a transfer hose while filling a nurse wagon. The resulting release according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage"

An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 with amendments and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, The Andersons Everly Farm Center has extended to the Everly Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe Andersons Everly Farm Center has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, The Andersons Everly Farm Center would immediately notify the Everly Volunteer Fire Department and the Clay County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Everly Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Everly location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Everly has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this procedure with the fire department and Clay County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia"

In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe plan is to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from spills and accidental releases. A safety inspection is performed before product is moved from the storage tank to nurse tanks. By doing a short walk around inspection of the facility a person is able to detect any problems before they arise. If any part of the system showed signs of stress, or if odors were present, corrective measures would be taken to repair the system before it became a problem. Employees are trained so they are aware of the hazards of handling and transferring anhydrous ammonia. The safety plan also includes a safety drill, wherein employees demonstrate the safe procedures of handling and transferring anhydrous ammonia. All employees handling anhydrous ammonia are required to comply with all safety measures and rules set forth by The Andersons, Inc."
