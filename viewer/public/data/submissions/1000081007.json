The Huntington Facility has two operating entities at the site known as Gladieux Processing LLC, and Gladieux Trading and Marketing Co., LP (GT&M Co., LP).  Unlike large crude oil refining facilities, Gladieux processes a petroleum product known as 'transmix.' Transmix is a mixture of finished products that occur  when fuels are transported in pipelines. The mixture is typically a combination of gasoline, diesel, and/or jet fuel, but as a mixture, do not meet approved specifications for fuels. Operations at the Facility produce saleable gasoline and diesel. \n\n\n\nIn order to meet Federal US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) mandates for ultra-low sulfur fuel, Gladieux has invested in a significant expansion at its Huntington facility. Gladieux has employed state-of-the-art technology after separating transmix into gasoline and diesel fuel to meet mandated ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel requirements. This technology, called hydrotreating, and subsequent processing, requires the use of several chemicals regulated under USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program. The regulated chemicals include sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and hydrogen.  These chemicals are included in the Hydrotreater Process at the Huntington Facility.\n\n\n\nOperations at the Facility also include the storage and handling of a light-gas blend (LGB).  This LGB is a flammable mixture and is also included in this registration as a second process (i.e., LGB Storage & Handling Process).  This process includes pipeline transfers and storage in atmospheric storage tanks and in pressure vessels.\n\n\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program requires regulated facilities to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP). Likewise, the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires facilities handling these chemicals and flammable mixtures to develop a Process Safety Management (PSM) p"

RMP/PSM is targeted to ensure that programs and procedures are in place to prevent accidental releases that could injure workers or impact the community. \n\n\n\nGladieux's use of the RMP/PSM regulated materials includes product receipt, bulk storage, and transfer to processing equipment. Gladieux has developed a RMP/PSM program including procedures targeted to hazard identification, accident prevention, and emergency response. Gladieux's RMP/PSM program includes: \n\n   -  Process hazard analysis reviews\n\n   -  Written operating procedures\n\n   -  Operator training\n\n   -  Mechanical integrity (i.e., preventive maintenance) \n\n\n\nThe program includes a compilation of documentation that describes the hazards of the chemicals and flammables handled, process technology, the design of process equipment, and safety systems employed. Development of these prevention programs included participation of facility employees (including operators and maintenance personnel) knowledgeable in plant operations. The RMP/PSM program includes procedures for managing change as well as pre-startup review. Safe work practices include, but are not limited to, hot work, lock-out/tag-out, confined space entry, line/vessel opening, and others. These programs are targeted to enhance safety and accident prevention. \n\n\n\nGladieux's management team, along with all of its employees, is committed to providing a workplace free of accidents. For example, during the early stages of the Hydrotreater Process design, the facility conducted a comprehensive hazard and operability (HAZOP) study geared to identifying potential hazards related to the hydrotreating process and use of sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and hydrogen. The HAZOP included evaluation of engineering and administrative controls to prevent, detect, or mitigate hazards. The HAZOP identified recommendations for improved process safety that were incorporated into the final design. A second HAZOP was then conducted to review the status of pre"

The HAZOP study teams included Gladieux plant personnel, engineering process design personnel, and technology providers.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a HAZOP review of the LGB process was conducted in June 2019.  Several opportunities for improved process safety were identified and are presently under review.\n\n\n\nGladieux's RMP/PSM program includes a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP includes procedures for notification, response procedures, evacuation, and follow-up in the event of an accidental release of the hazardous chemicals and light gasoline blend fuel. Gladieux is an active member of the Huntington Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), including participation in table-top and full-scale emergency response exercises. \n\n\n\nThere is no history of reportable accidental releases associated with sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, or LGB at the Facility.  \n\n\n\nGladieux's management team is committed to continuous improvement, including identification of additional prevention and detection measures as needed.\n\n"
