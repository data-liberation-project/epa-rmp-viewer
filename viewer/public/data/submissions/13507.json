Penn Champ is a subsidiary of the Bissell Specialty Chemical Corporation.  For more than 60 years, we have grown our reputation in the private label aerosol and liquid household, health and beauty, and automotive products industries by providing the highest quality products and the best customer service.  Our in-house staff of chemists have created formulations that perform equal to, or better than their \"brand name\" national counterparts.  Our chemists use their combined 40 plus years of experience to create a product to meet the highest performance standards.  A major part of that performance criteria is creating products that are environmentally friendly.  At Penn Champ Inc. we use no chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) and meet or exceed standards issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).   We are proud of our facility and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r) (\"112(r)\"), codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nPenn Champ has two mixtures of flammable substances that meet the criteria for listing under 112(r), and thus, these substances must be included in a Risk Management Program for the respective operation.  These substances, whose major components are propane and isobutane, are propellants stored in bulk vessels and used in the process of individual canisters.  \n\nFor"

Additional chemicals on site, not meeting their TQ or not identified in the 112(r) list rule, are managed using risk-management principles similiar to those applied to our chemicals fully covered by 112(r).  \n\nThis Executive Summary of Penn Champ's Risk Management Plan (RMP) provides an overview of how we are effectively meeting our responsibilities to the community through compliance with the 112(r) rule.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nPenn Champ has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its Risk Management Program responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of our program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified person has been assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program elements. Responsibility for implementing individual requirements of the Treatment Plant's program have been delegated to competent individuals.  An organization chart has been prepared to identify the responsible personnel and lines of authority for implementing the program.  Record-keeping responsibilities are also included in the management system.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \n\"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios as appropriate to the opera"

Scenarios to consider include transfer hose splits or uncoupling, process \n       piping failures, process vessel or pump cracks and failures, vessel overfilling and spill or \n       overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks, and shipping container \n       mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\n-     We assumed a complete rupture and content loss of the largest quantity vessel.
