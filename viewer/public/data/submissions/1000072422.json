The Memphis facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and co-ops.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe Helm Memphis facility stores and handles anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia, which are subject to reporting under this filing to the EPA.  The facility receives anhydrous ammonia via barges and railcars, and the anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in numerous storage vessels until it can be loaded into trucks for shipment.  In addition, the facility utilizes an aqua ammonia converter to add water to the anhydrous ammonia to create 19.5% and 29.4% aqueous ammonia, which is stored at the facility until it is loaded for shipment at a common loadout location. \n\n \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Helm Memphis facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.  The required elements of the RMP p"

These items, their specific requirements, and how the Helm Memphis facility complies with the requirements are addressed in the procedural documents.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Helm Memphis facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Memphis facility will notify the local emergency responders and will evacuate their employees when needed.  Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) in July 2018 that identified several recommendations for enhanced process safety.  These recommendations are summarized in the PHA report and are currently under evaluation.\n\n"
