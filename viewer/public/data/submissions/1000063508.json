This\n\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\n\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\n\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Newberry gas processing plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products\n\n(e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate) from raw natural gas. This plant has two\n\nregulated flammables: Propane and NFPA 4 flammable mixtures.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because\n\nprocesses at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk\n\nmanagement program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses\n\neach of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the\n\naccident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Newberry gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\n\nmanagement and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and\n\ncompiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process\n\nhazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas\n\nplant acc"

In addition, members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance,\n\nengineering, and plant management participate in the Navitas Environmental, Health and\n\nSafety(EHS) Committee. The EHS Committee reviews processes and implements improvements to\n\npromote both process and personal safety.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Newberry gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\n\noperation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated\n\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design\n\nbasis/configuration information. The area PSM Coordinator, in conjunction with plant personnel, is\n\nassigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific\n\ninformation, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment\n\nconsiderations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by\n\ndocuments that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated\n\nwith the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented\n\nsafety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the\n\nOperating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is\n\nmaintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments,\n\ntrained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The gas\n\nplant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and\n\nconstruction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design\n\npressure and temperature ratin"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify\n\nhazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Newberry gas plant primarily \n\nuses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized\n\nas one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. \n\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who\n\nhave operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies\n\nand evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and\n\nthe team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team\n\nbelieves such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation\n\noptions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.\n\nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive\n\nimmediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked\n\nuntil they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help\n\nensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from\n\nthe original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis\n\nresults.

These procedures can be\n\nused as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new\n\noperators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and\n\naccurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect\n\nchanges made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Newberry gas plant maintains Operating Procedures that provide guidance on how\n\nto respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This\n\ninformation is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as\n\nnecessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Newberry gas plant has\n\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.\n\nNew employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with\n\nsuch operations.

A\n\nPSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by\n\nrequiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Newberry gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure\n\nvessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency\n\nshutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1)\n\nconducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests,\n\n(4)correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination,\n\nthese activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance\n\npersonnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3)\n\napplicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work\n\npractices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help\n\nensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections\n\nand tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that\n\nequipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a\n\ndeficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into\n\nservice (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and\n\ndetermine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another\n\nintegral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Newberry gas plant\n\nincorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure\n\nthat new equipment is suitable for its intended"

The following\n\ntypes of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\nCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation\n\nAtmospheric relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\nTrained emergency response personnel\n\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing\n\napparatus).\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Newberry gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to\n\nprotect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for\n\nresponding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a\n\nflammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency\n\nresponse, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and\n\naccounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and\n\nthe public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency\n\nresponse equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response\n\nequipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific\n\nemergency response duties. The emergency response program is update"
