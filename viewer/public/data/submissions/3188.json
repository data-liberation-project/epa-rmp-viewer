A.R.P.* and Emergency Response\n\n             The KCWF policy is to prevent and/or eliminate any accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide\n             at our site.  The existing emergency response policies are practical and functional designed to      \n             minimize and conrol the risks, protect county employees, the neighboring community and the\n             site environment.  While a number of outside agencies would participate in the response to our\n             emergency, our plant's emergency response team would immediately contain and handle any site\n             emergency.\n\n2.     Regulated Substances\n\n        *    The primary activity of the municipal KCWTP and its 48 pump stations and lift stations is to treat      \n              Kent County domestic wastewater and wastewater from twelve industrial sites.\n\n        *    Chlorine and sulfur dioxide is used in the disinfection section of this secondary wastewater   \n              treatment plant.\n\n        *    The site uses about 100 ton containers of each chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and we store 10\n              chlorine tons and 6 sulfur dioxide tons at any given time.\n\n3.     Worst-Case\n        Release Scenario\n\n        *     One chlorine ton cylinder (2,000 lbs.) ruptures releasing contents in 10 minutes, the release rate\n              is 200 lbs./min.   Chlorine ton cylinders regularly undergo external and internal inspection by the\n              chlorine supplier.  We have chlorine leak detectors and an Alarm System.  Plant personnel are\n              trained and equipped to respond to chlorine releases.\n\n         *    Under worst-case weather, chlorine could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer \n              pose a hazard to the public.\n\n        Alternative \n        Release Scenario\n\n         *    Chlorine evaporator develops a leak due to corrosion, the hole is 1/16 inch in diameter.  Shut off"

General ARP* Program,\n         and Chemical - Specific\n         Prevention steps\n\n         *      The KCWF is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule, 40 CFR Parts 68.150 and 68.155 through\n                 68.185.\n\n         *      The key steps in our prevention program are:\n\n                 *     Chemical contracts that provide for safe ton containers transportation, unloading/loading\n                       (leak correction if necessary) and KCWF employee Safety Training.\n\n                 *      KCWF has a backup for both chemical systems.\n\n                 *      We have improved our Preventative Maintenance Program at the site and continue with our\n                        hands on training on capping leaks on ton cylinders.\n\n5.     Five Year\n        Accident History\n\n                 *       KCWF had no accidential releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\n6.     The Emergency\n        Response Program\n\n                 *       KCWF has an Emergency Response Plan which as been coordinated with the community\n                         plan.\n                         KCWF Hazmat Team has conducted joint training and drills with the local fire departments\n                         and other agencies.  Public notification was made prior to our last drill 5/11/99.\n\n7.    Planned Changes\n       to Improve Safety\n\n                 *      Start automation study/project for Plant and Pump Stations in July, 1999.  This will improve \n                        our safety performance.\n\n                 *      Will implement all recommendations from the last (5/11/99) HazMat Drill, and before the next \n                         Hazmat Drill.\n\n                 *      Review and adopt the Water Environment Federation (WEF) recommended new safety"
