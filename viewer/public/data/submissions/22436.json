The facility manufactures Lightweight Coated (LWC) fine paper and bleached kraft pulp and employs about 670 employees. The LWC paper is used in printed material such as magazines and newspaper inserts. The bleached kraft pulp operation manufactures papergrade and fluff pulp. The papergrade and fluff pulp is sold and made, respectively, into fine paper and absorbent products such as diapers.\n\nThere is one RMP covered chemical used on the plant site. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) gas is a yellowish/green gas manufactured on the plant site and used to bleach kraft pulp. There are 2 ClO2 solution storage tanks with a volume of 94,000 gallons each. The chlorine dioxide generator is capable of manufacturing about 600 gallons/minute at a concentration of 10.8 grams/liter solution (1.08%). \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nThe RMP rule requires Weyerhaeuser to perform an off site consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n?

In a worst case release scenario, the volume of one tank is assumed to empty over a 10-minute period and the predicted release scenario is described as follows:\n\n The chlorine dioxide containment will hold just over 9000 gallons and the sewer will drain at an estimated 5000 gpm. Therefore, the containment and drain will discharge to the sewer about 14,000 gallons over the 10 minute release period (13.8% of the total maximum storage in one tank). The remainder of the tank contents will flow out of the containment area through the walkways cut through the top of the containment walls on the north and south sides. It's estimated that about 41,000 gallons will be discharged through each entrance. \n\nThe discharge through the south entrance empties into the Chem Prep alley where flow is predicted to be evenly split into east and west directions. Approximately 20,500 gallons (21.8%) would flow east down the concrete alley and enter into a stormwater earthen drainage ditch, which will continue to flow east. This ditch is manually valved closed at all times unless stormwater is being drained. The solution would flow through the ditch for about 0.6 miles before becoming impounded at the ditch valve.\n\nThe approximately 20,500 gallons (21.8%) that flows west down the Chem Prep alley will drain into 5 street stormwater drains to the process sewer and into 6 street level chemical storage containment entrances where u-drains will discharge to the sewer. Some of the ClO2 solution will probably enter two walkways connecting Chem Prep alley with the railcar unloading station. Drainage entering these walkways will flow north to the rail yard which drains to an earthen ditch piped to the process sewer. It's expected that all of the 20,500 gallons flowing west down Chem Prep alley will drain to the process sewer. \n\nThe 41,000 gallons"

The rock ballast underdrain system will drain stormwater (or a ClO2 solution release) away from the tracks and into the stormwater ditch just north of Chem Prep.  This ditch drains to the process sewer. Therefore, all materials spilled north of the ClO2 containment will eventually drain into the process sewer via the railcar pans or through the storm ditch.\n\nIn both the chlorine dioxide worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's WATER8 emission calculation model was used to estimate the chlorine dioxide volatilization and EPA's SLAB dispersion model was used to predict downwind distance to the 1.0-PPM toxic endpoint.  The worst case scenario released 451.4 lbs/min of chlorine dioxide with an 11.8 mile (19 kilometers) radius to the ClO2 toxic endpoint of 1.0 ppmv. Using EPA's LandView III environmental mapping software, an estimated 9,584 homes and 26,722 people are within this area. Lake Lowndes State Park and the Columbus lock & dam recreational area are also located within this radius. \n\nA Chlorine Dioxide - Alternative Release Scenario #1\nScenario #1 assumed that a level transmitter in the chlorine dioxide storage tank failed and that the tank overflowed for 30 minutes before operators noted the overflow. This is unlikely due to gas monitors around the storage tank area and the presence of operators working in Chem Prep. The storage tank overflow is hard piped to the acid sewer and most of the chlorine dioxide gas would be released downstream of the ClO2 generator area off the wastewater treatment system sumps and clarifier. \n\nWith a production rate of 600 gallons per minute, a total of 18,000 gallons would be sewered in this scenario.

There are no environmental receptors in this area. \n\nA Chlorine Dioxide - Alternative Release Scenario #2\nAlternative release scenario #2 assumed that the chlorine dioxide storage tank was 60% full and an I beam or other heavy object was dropped during a maintenance activity around the tank, hitting the pump discharge line at the bottom of the tank shearing it away. Approximately 53,658 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution was released over a 22 minute period through an 8 inch orifice where the discharge line was sheared away from the tank.\n\nSimilar to the worst case release scenario, there are generally 4 separate pathways the solution would flow. The containment would fill and drain to the acid sewer (pathway 1) but once the containment was filled, the release would split about evenly with part exiting the north entrance to the chlorine dioxide containment and flowing into a ditch draining to the process sewer (pathway 2). The released solution would also exit the south entrance to the chlorine dioxide containment area and split evenly (pathway 3 and 4) with one portion flowing west into the Chem Prep ally sewer drains and another part flowing east into the stormwater ditch. The chlorine dioxide release rate for the second alternative release scenario was modeled at 94.8 lbs/minute with a 1.0 ppm endpoint radius of 2.0 miles.

The PHA findings are shared with employees working with hazardous chemicals. Employees are advised of any necessary changes brought about by the PHA and, in some cases, may be involved in the design change and implementation process. \n\nA Operating Procedures: \nCPPC process engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed. Employees participate in operating procedure development in several ways: \n1. Employees are consulted during procedure development and implementation to determine if the procedures accurately reflect what is practiced in the field and what additional measures should be added to increase worker safety and protect the environment.\n2. Development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are assigned to employees that have recognized knowledge, experience and job skills related to the assigned procedure. \n3. Implementation of new processes or procedures is assigned to a commissioning team. These assignments typically include an opportunity for a critique of the work processes and procedures. \n\nA Training: \nCPPC trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Employees are trained through self-taught learning materials including operations manuals, educational modules and computer based education programs. In addition, employees are trained one-on-one through on-the-job training in the field. Employees are encouraged to identify education needs and take part in education development and implementation.

The employee doing the actual test and inspection work is typically asked to review and comment about manufacturers recommendations for preventive maintenance procedures and test frequencies. Employees take part in equipment failure reviews, participate in work process critiques, and are encouraged to make recommendations for change. \n\nA Management of change: \nThe CPPC management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are approved without completing the full management of change process.

On November 26, 1996, an employee opened a valve spilling some pulp stock from the bleaching process. A conservative estimate of 25 - 30 lbs of chlorine dioxide gas was released from the stock irritating the employee. The employee saw the plant nurse and was taken to the emergency room for overnight observation. There were no other onsite or offsite impacts and offsite responders were not notified.\n\nAn incident investigation task team met and began a 12 point process investigation. The 12 point process investigation was completed and corrective actions were implemented. Job Safety Analysis were updated and more sensitive ClO2 gas monitors were purchased and installed. No ClO2 equipment design or installation deficiencies were found. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nAn Emergency Response Team capable of providing multiple emergency response functions is available on the plantsite. The team has regular Haz-Mat, fire fighting, and confined space/high angle rescue training and drills. In addition, the team is trained in CPR, patient packaging and handling and bloodborne pathogens. \n\nIn emergencies, the shift manager is the incident commander who determines the degree of hazard and risk posed to public health and the environment. An internal alert alarm system can be sounded to summon the emergency response team. Procedures for regulatory, emergency management agency, and public notification are documented in the Quality System. Mutual aid requests are made through 911 notification. \n\nContinuous Improvement\nContinuous improvement in our safety and environmental programs is the expectation at CPPC. Near miss and safety incident investigations, root cause analysis and corrective action implementation support continuous improvement. In addition, Plant Safety and Health Guidelines are being updated and moved to the Quality System for ease of use and updating. Individual safety pl"

Team members are involved in incident investigation since their knowledge and skills in operations or maintenance are necessary to conduct the investigation. Once investigation team reports become available, the results and recommendations of the team are made available to those working in the process or operation. Communication is in the form of a report, which is circulated among employees and is discussed in scheduled safety meetings and in ad hoc meetings with team members. \n\nA Employee Participation : \nCPPC developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of CPPC workers are addressed. Team members participate in compiling process safety and maintenance information with field checks to verify the accuracy of P&IDs, loop sketches, and equipment drawings used in normal work processes and through communication of observations made during the normal conduct of their work - particularly those that reflect operational safety hazards. \n\nA Hot Work Permits (Safe Work Practices): \nCPPC established a hot work permit program to control activities which may result in fires or explosions in covered processes. Team members, with appropriate job skills and experience, participate in the review of safe work practice procedures through their involvement with safety subteams, site-central safety core team or ad-hoc task teams.  A cross section of knowledgeable team members may be called upon to draft procedures and revisions to procedures.

Each site team member and contract employee is encouraged to ash questions and to raise concerns about unsafe work activities or conditions. Site team members are expected to inform contract employers of the potential hazards of fire, explosion or toxic releases when repairing equipment so that contractors can work on it safely.\n\nA Emergency Planning and Response: \nCPPC has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. A formal review process to solicit and obtain employees input on millwide procedures exists to improve site emergency response plans.
