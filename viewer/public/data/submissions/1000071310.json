The chemical is:\r\n\r\n- Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, and other components, manufactured on site.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\r\n\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\r\n\r\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\n \r\nPrevention Program:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Texas City facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\r\n\r\n- Technical documentation of PSI (Process Safety Information), describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\r\n\r\n- Procedures and programs to develop"
