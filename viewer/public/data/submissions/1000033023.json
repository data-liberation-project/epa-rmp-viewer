If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local sheriffs department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia to sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 170,391 pounds in the storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in the RMP Regristration Form; see Section 8.3(b).\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\nA. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standar 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to -know information as required under SARA Title (EPCRA);\n\nC. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n     1. With-in 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify: The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424-8802.\n\n     2. With-in 24 hours of determining the amount of releas would effect the environment, the Emergency Coordinator will no"
