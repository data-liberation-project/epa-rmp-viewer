The facility is a subsidiary of the Performance Materials and Technology sector of Honeywell International, headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey. The Muskegon plant was initially built in 1959 as Burdick & Jackson. The company became part of AlliedSignal Specialty Chemicals in 1996 which merged with Honeywell in 1999 keeping the Honeywell name. \n\n\n\nHoneywell Muskegon is committed to managing health, safety and the environment as a core business value to ensure compliance with all applicable government standards and regulations. The facility also integrates health, safety and environmental management into our business as a way of achieving profitable growth and accelerated productivity. Participation in the Responsible Care, program of the American Chemistry Council, has been achieved and the certification has been maintained since 2005. The Responsible Care is a chemical industry program focused on achieving improvements in health, safety and environmental performance beyond levels required by the U.S. government. The program directs companies to adopt practices for the safe use of materials, perform regular audits and to reach out and communicate with the communities in which the company operates.\n\n\n\nIn 2011 the site received Honeywell Operating System (HOS) Silver certification and currently maintains that status. In 2019, the site received recommendation for the Rising Star status in Michigan's OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (MVPP) and has the intention of applying for and receiving Star status. This voluntary program is a partnership between MIOSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs.  STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition MIOSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe pla"

      "SummaryText": "nt is a high purity solvent manufacturing facility that has 78 full time equivalent employees. There are three main operating steps; raw material receiving/storage, processing and packaging. Solvents can be processed using distillation, blending or filtration/adsorption and then packaged in a wide variety of innovative packaging solutions for distribution. The final products, high purity solvents, are used in a variety of different industries for laboratory testing, pharmaceutical or electronic component manufacturing. \n\n\n\nChemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include chloroform (toxic) and ethyl ether (flammable). The RMP threshold quantity of chloroform is 20,000 lbs; the site can store up to 123,000 lbs. The stationary source of chloroform consists of a tanker unloading area and a bulk storage tank. Chloroform is purchased on an as needed basis, delivered via a tanker truck and unloaded by plant operators into an above-ground bulk storage tank which is located in the North Tank Farm. The RMP threshold quantity of ethyl ether is 10,000 lbs; the site can store up to 59,000 lbs. The stationary source of ethyl ether consists of a tanker unloading area and a bulk storage tank. Ethyl ether is purchased on an as needed basis, delivered via a tanker truck and unloaded by plant operators into an above-ground bulk storage tank which is also located in the North Tank Farm.\n\n\n\nThere are two main emergency contacts for the Honeywell Muskegon facility; 1) Margaret Pibuldhanapatana, HSE Leader, direct line (231) 725-6281, cell phone (231) 457-3352 and 2) Jeff Halvorson, Maintenance and Engineering Leader, direct line (231) 725-6268, cell phone (231) 288-9910.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Honeywell Muskegon to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety or environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to prot"

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at the facility involves integration of Honeywell Standards along with senior management commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures and safe practices. Some of these elements include: employee participation in all PSM elements, safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the processes, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response plans, maintenance of emergency response equipment, coordination with local emergency response services and communicating with the community. The site's PSM program is outlined in HSE procedure 12-301, Process Safety Management System.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the facility's use of chloroform and ethyl ether involves integration of Honeywell Standards with the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP Regulation. This policy includes the following elements: a) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the chloroform and ethyl ether processes; b) development and implementation of accurate procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process; c) an on-going mechanical integrity program that ensures critical process equipment is designed, constructed and installed in accordance to codes and standards and is also inspected, tested and proactively maintained; d) performance of process hazards analyses with resolution of r"

The Plan also addresses emergency medical care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The site utilizes an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate response activities. The Plan has been developed with the Muskegon Fire Department who would direct all community response activities in conjunction with the site Incident Commander. The site organizes emergency response drills and conducts them quarterly. Plant tours are offered annually for public emergency responders to become familiarized with the facility layout, potential hazards and emergency response plans.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nHoneywell Muskegon maintains a commitment to continuously improve the safety of plant processes through improvement initiatives and employee input. One example of a major safety initiative is described below.\n\n\n\nA recommendation from a Facility Siting Analysis completed by Honeywell Corporate Process Safety Engineering was to install fenceline monitors to alert the facility if Chloroform solvent vapor were to travel outside the plant fenceline at a PAC-2 or higher concentration in the event of a catastrophic release. PAC-2 is a concentration level where toxic vapors begin to have a serious effect on life and health. This has been added to the 2019 capital execution plan. The scope of this project has been refined to install gas monitors adjacent to the facility's North Tank Farm (where the bulk Chloroform tank is located) with a dedicated controller used to trigger local and remote monitoring system alarms. Additionally, this system will tie into the plant control network.\n\n"
