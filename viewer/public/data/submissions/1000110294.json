This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  \n\nThis Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince this is a new facility (startup March 2014), there is no accident history to report.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hazards Review was conducted February 19th 2014 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the CV East LLC facility. In addition to recommendations from the Hazard Review, the facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n3. Continue employee involvement through PSM team participation.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over pressurization. The relief valves vent to a water diffusion tank designed to hold one gallon of water per pound of ammonia which could be release from the largest relief valve.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe CV East LLC facility has an emerge"
