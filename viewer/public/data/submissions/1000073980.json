Buckeye Perth Amboy Terminal LLC is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Perth Amboy Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in three (3) storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck (3 offload stations) for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into the gasoline manifold.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Perth Amboy Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment.
