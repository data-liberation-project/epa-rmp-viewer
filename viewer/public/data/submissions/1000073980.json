The Terminal is located on the west bank of the Arthur Kill approximately two miles north of its entrance to the Raritan Bay.  The Terminal covers about 272 acres.  \n\n\n\nBuckeye Perth Amboy Terminal LLC - Perth Amboy Terminal (Duns 019912808) in Perth Amboy, NJ is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Buckeye believes that excellent  performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HSE performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Perth Amboy Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community. Buckeye promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Buckeye has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Perth Amboy Terminal, located in Perth Amboy, New Jersey is to act as a bulk storage fuel terminal.  The butane blending process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane"

      "SummaryText": ", it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Buckeye Perth Amboy Terminal LLC is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Perth Amboy Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in three (3) storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck (3 offload stations) for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into the gasoline manifold.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Perth Amboy Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68 and NJDEP TCPA Title 7, Chapter 31, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Perth Amboy Terminal:\n\n\n\n1) Employee"

The company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards\n\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.)\n\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams\n\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators\n\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation\n\n-Redundant control systems \n\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems\n\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices\n\n-Limited facility access\n\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs\n\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits\n\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators\n\n\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n\n\n-Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity\n\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks\n\n-Hydrocarbon detectors at key areas to warn of a chemical release\n\n-Fire"
