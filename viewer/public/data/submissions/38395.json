(KRAFT) - TOLEDO, OH FACILITY\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been implemented at Kraft for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n\u00bf Introduction;\n\u00bf Kraft policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00bf Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00bf Hazard Assessment;\n\u00bf Prevention Program;\n\u00bf Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00bf Emergency Response Plan; and\n\u00bf Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n2.0 KRAFT POLICIES TO PROTECT HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Kraft; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Kraft is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\n3.0 FACILITY IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe Kraft facility is located at 2221 Front Street in Toledo, Ohio. The facility is a flour mill and uses chlorine in its bleaching system and wheat temper water chlorination system.  Chlorine use at the flour mill is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. The amount of chlorine present at the mill is above the minimum threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  \n\n4.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT - WORST CASE SCENARIOS (WCS)\n\nThe worst-case toxic accidental release scenario is presented in the RMP.  A description of this analysis has been removed from the executive summary in accordance with the RMP rule amendments dated April 9, 2004.  \n\n5.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT - ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS (ARS)\n\nThe alternative toxic accidental release scenario is presented in the RMP.
