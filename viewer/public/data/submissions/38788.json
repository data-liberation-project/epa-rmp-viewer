The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSacramento County Water Agency is the entity with primary responsibility for a water treatment plant designated WT2, Waterman Road, located at 8246 Waterman Rd. in Elk Grove, CA in Sacramento County, using chlorine, an RS, for treatment of well water in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  By contractual arrangement with Sacramento County Water Agency, Sacramento County Department of Water Quality (DWQ) operators visit the site on a regular basis and also respond to alarm conditions.  DWQ has contractual responsibility for operation, maintenance, and emergency response for this site.\n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored strapped to"

The chlorine is used for oxidation of iron and manganese in well water prior to filtration, and to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves,  metered through manually-adjusted rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Sacramento County Water Agency that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Sacramento County Water Agency has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a contractual arrangement with DWQ who maintains a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and who in addition maintains a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sacramento County Water Agency are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  Sacramento County Water Agency has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering the chlorination process at the Waterman Rd. WTP.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevent"

The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and have been implemented.  These include installation of  seismic restraints for the ton container scales.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSacramento County Water Agency's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination, and with the Elk Grove Fire Department, the local agency responsible for Incident Command activities.  Sacramento County DWQ maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at sites which it operates and maintains under contractual arrangement with Sacramento Water Agency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Sacramento County Water Agency committed to accomplish are complete or in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
