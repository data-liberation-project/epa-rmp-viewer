Our Risk Management Plan is as follows:\n\n1.      Continental Carbonic is a liquid and dry ice manufacturer and distributer. The facility will have approximately 75 employees, which includes 25 truck drivers and 2-3 clerical staff. The company has been in business since 1976 and has its corporate headquarters in Decatur, Illinois. Upon being hired by Continental Carbonic employees receive an orientation regarding chemicals kept at the location and where the chemicals are stored. Employees are taught how to respond in an emergency and how to exit the building through any door way to an evacuation point. \n\n2.\tContinental Carbonic will work with local emergency response agencies for emergency responses to the Greenville, Ohio Plant. Employees will evacuate the building immediately upon having a release of anhydrous ammonia. Upon exiting the building, employees will observe the wind direction sock and stay upwind and go to a main gathering point to be accounted for. All piping will be labeled with labeling diagram given to local emergency responders. Immediately upon knowing of a release local fire, police, ambulance and LEPC will be notified. Employees will receive initial training as they are orientated to work at the plant. All controls and valves are marked and painted, which a diagram will be given to local emergency responders. \n\nContinental Carbonic's maintenance department has a preventive maintenance program for checking and maintaining ammonia valves and piping. Weekly, monthly and annual inspections will be made of equipment to assure integrity of ammonia systems. \n\n3.\tAnhydrous Ammonia receiver is located on the South East corner outside of the building. Ammonia is piped into a closed loop system and will"
