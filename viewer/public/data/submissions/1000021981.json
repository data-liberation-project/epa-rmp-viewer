      "SummaryText": "Worst Case Flammable Release Scenario: Condensate (Flammable Mixture) was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario. The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the condensate in the largest condensate vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. Based on worst-case analyses of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints (i.e. An overpressure of 1 psi) do not exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial, commercial and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas, inhabited or occupied by the public). In addition, the Conger Gas Plant has not had an accidental release in the past five years and emergency response procedures have been coordinated with community response organizations. Under normal operations there is one person on site during an 8 hour day. The plant is unattended 16 hours a day and on weekends and holidays."
