If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Detroit Fire Department, as well as the Wayne County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services and Oakwood Hospital.  This facility maintains a trained fire brigade and hazardous materials response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC. - Detroit Terminal is a bulk gasoline storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one 60,000 gallon storge tank.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the systems tank when filled to the greatest amonut allowed (92.4% at60 degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.5 miles and includes public receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenario is a \"pull away\" accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.02 miles, but does not effect public receptors.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC. - Detroit Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevetion rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  This butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (MCE) instructions.\n\nTo date, this facility ha"
