The progam includes engineering, education and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and storm water management, and air contaminant management for substances used in the plant and in storage outside the plant. Employees are specifically involved in programs for hazcom, physical, chemical, and biological hazards, personal protective equipment, locking and tagging, confined space entry, emergency response, powered industrial trucks and other vehicles.  Safety, health and enviromental programs are reviewed annually by both inside auditors and outside consultants.  An ongoing OSHA PSM program with current maintenance and operating procedures is maintained and reviewed annually. The mechanical integrity of the ammonia system is assured by the use of a computerized preventive maintenance and parts tracking program.\n\n2.  Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances. Conagra Foods is a meat processing plant located on an approximate 10 acre site. The main building houses a processing plant used for mixing, cooking, conveying, freezing, packaging and warehousing. The processed meat product requires refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primanry refrigerant used. The system contains 33,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios. RMP CMP was used to calculate the worst case and alternative case scenarios.\n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program  and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. This program is based on a computerized preventive maintenance program to assure that the integrity of the mechanical system is maintained. Preventive maintenance schedules and procedures follow the manufacturer's and industry guidelines. Ammonia detectors a"

There have been no incidents or accidents during the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.  The program details procedures that are to be implemented and includes the assignment of responsbilities to personnel should there be a release of a chemical. This detailed emergency response program is updated annually and submitted to the local fire department and the LEPC for review and comment. The company provides annual training to all members of the emergency response team with particular emphasis given to the possible release of ammonia. Initial and annual refresher training along with medical surveillance is conducted for response team members. Plant personnel are involved in programs designed to help them recognize and report or control safety, health and environmental hazards and risks. Operating procedures for all equipment in both normal and emergency modes is a part of each employee's initial and recurrent training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety. An emergency generator will be installed to power four exhaust fans in the engine room in case of a power outage. Traffic control posts will be installed around the perimeter of the condensing tower to reduce the possibility of a vehicle intrusion."
