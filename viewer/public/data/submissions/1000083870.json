Sweetwater Authority's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Safety Coordinator, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the CalARP Program. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\n\n\nThe Sweetwater Authority - Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility (Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility) is located at 3066 N. 2nd Avenue in Chula Vista, California, which is located approximately 50 feet north of Highway 54 and approximately 0.6 miles west of Interstate 805.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility was constructed in 1999.  \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system at the Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility is used for the treatment of groundwater used for domestic purposes. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a storage tank of aqueous ammonia (up to 29% weight minimum anhydrous ammonia), a regulated substance.  The maximum intended charge of aqueous ammonia is 3,000 gallons (23,130 pounds).\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nIn order to operate the aqueous ammonia system, the facility complies with the California Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThe Richard A. Reynolds Desalination Facility aqueous ammonia groundwater treatment system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the po"

Reynolds Desalination Facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the water treatment system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of aqueous ammonia. Also, in the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facilities fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there are several mechanisms at the facility to minimize the impact:  1) portable ammonia vapor detector, 2) a containment basin surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank to hold the entire contents of the tank, and 3) an ammonia scrubber that protects the storage tank against excess pressure conditions.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nThe RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n-On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n-Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Hazard Review Study on October 29, 2019, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 1,000 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the last five years (October 2014 - October 2019). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Pla"

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nSweetwater Authority personnel inspect the aqueous ammonia system daily, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an aqueous ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Safety Coordinator.  The Plant Emergency Coordinator will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nThe Hazard Review Study for the aqueous ammonia system was performed on October 29, 2019.  The study generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the facility located in Chula Vista, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Sweetwater Authority Water Quality staff is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team partic"
