The facility was constructed and began operations in 1987.  \n\nThe primary business of J&J Snack is to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of bakery items. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 14,418 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the facility. \n\nRefrigeration System Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of bakery items.\n\nThe refrigeration process begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condenser to the Horizontal Pilot/Thermosyphon Receiver (PR-1) which sends high pressure liquid to the Intercooler (INT-1), and Dock Coolers (AU-12 & AU-13). \n\nThe Dock Coolers (AU-12 & AU-13) receive high pressure liquid ammonia from the Pilot/Thermosyphon Receiver (PR-1) and feeds high temperature suction to the Intercooler (INT-2). High stage suction is drawn off the top of the to the Vertical Intercooler (INT-2) and sent to the High Stage Compressors (HS-1 & HS-2) and Compressor (C-6). The Intercooler (INT-2) also receives high pressure liquid ammonia from the Horizontal Pilot/Thermosyphon Receiver (PR-1).\n\nAt the -40\u00b0F Spiral Freezers, -10\u00b0F Freezer Evaporators, and +40\u00b0F Dock Cooler Evaporators the liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat fr"

The -40\u00b0F Spiral Freezers and -10\u00b0F Freezer Evaporators utilize high stage discharge from the compressors for coil defrost. The +40\u00b0F Dock Evaporators are operated at higher temperatures and use air to defrost the coils if necessary.\n\nAt the Vertical Recirculators (VPR-1 and VPR-2) vapor is drawn off the top of the vessel by the Booster Compressors (from VPR-1) and Single Stage Compressor #6 (from VPR-2). The liquid settles at the bottom of the vessel (VPR-2) and is sent to the other Recirculator (VPR-1) as well as the Storage Freezers (AU-5 \u0096 AU-11) which returns low temperature suction back to the Recirculatos (VPR-2). The liquid that settles at the bottom of Recirculator (VPR-1) is sent to the spiral freezers (SP-2 \u0096 SP-5) which then returns low temperature suction back to the Recirculator (VPR-1).\n\nThe Booster Compressors (B-1 \u0096 B-4) draw vapor from the -40\u00b0F Vertical Recirculator (VPR-1). The Booster Compressors then send the booster discharge to the Vertical Intercooler.\n\nThe Vertical Intercooler (INT-2) receives booster discharge from the Booster Compressors and high temperature suction from the +40?F Dock Evaporators.  The liquid makeup is provided by the Pilot/Thermosyphon Receiver (PR-1). The suction absorbs heat from the surrounding high pressure liquid. The resulting high stage suction is drawn from the Vertical Intercooler (INT-2) by the High Stage Compressors (HS-1- HS-2).  The low temperature liquid is transferred from the Vertical Intercooler (INT-2) to the -40\u00b0F Vertical Recirculator (VPR-1). \n\nThe High Stage Compressors (HS-1 \u0096 HS-2) and Compressor (C-6) draw vapor from the Vertical Intercooler (INT-2).

High pressure discharge from the High Stage Compressors is also routed to the Storage and Spiral Freezers, which utilize hot gas for coil defrost.\n\nAt the Condensers, water (pumps) and air (fans) are used to condense the high stage discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains to the Horizontal Pilot/Thermosyphon Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.\n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensibles, i.e. air, from the system.\n\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.  All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves which are set to actuate at 150, 250, 300 psig, depending on equipment operating conditions. Most relief valves in the engine room are piped to a common header, which vents to the atmosphere.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\u0095\tIIAR Standard 5-2019, \u0093Startup of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\u0094\n\u0095\tIIAR Standard 6-2019, \u0093Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\u0094\n\u0095\tIIAR Standard 7-2019, \u0093Developing Operating Procedures for Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\u0094\n\u0095\tIIAR, \u0093A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\u0094\n\nThe J&J Snack ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over-pressurization.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \u0093accident\u0094 as the following:\n\n\u0093An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\u0094\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\u0095\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19 CCR 5080.9(a)); or\n\u0095\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19 CCR 5080.9(a)).\u0094\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility\u0092s accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis study (May 14, 2024), there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five  \nyears (May 2019 \u0096 May 2024) nor any releases that meet the California-specific criteria above. However, the facility did experience an ammonia release that warranted an internal incident investigation:\n\n\u0095\tOn June 18, 2022, there was a small leak pinhole leak in a spiral freezer #2 packaging that registered 3 ppm in the Engine Room. C&L Refrigeration, the refrigeration contractor, was onsite to braze the system. There were no environmental or safety impacts.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\nJ&J Snack personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Director of EHSS. The Director of EHSS will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis study performed on May 14, 2024, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the J&J Snack facility located in Vernon, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The J&J Snack safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\nRecommendation tracking for the technical studies is included in Volume III, Recommendation Tracking.

Catastrophic failures are caused by (but are not limited to): vehicular accidents, meteorite impact, missile impact, sabotage, war, and seismic activity. A catastrophic line failure of the ammonia system could result in a line break, which was examined in the Hazard Assessment."
