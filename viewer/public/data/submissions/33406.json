WinCo Foods is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community. WinCo Foods staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia for its Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe WinCo Foods Woodburn Distribution Center has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the Woodburn Distribution Center processes. WinCo Foods' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response Guidelines for the Ammonia Refrigeration System have been in-place since initial operation to handle potential emergency situations at the facility. The emergency Planning and Response Guidelines address key regulatory requirements. These guidelines were designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1) To save lives\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries\n3) To protect the environment\n4) To minimize property damage\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Planning and Response Guidelines include:\n\n- Facility Description\n- Emergency Response Organization\n- Emergency Response Procedures\n- Notification Procedures\n- Evacuation Procedures\n- Mitigation Scenarios and Procedures\n- Incident Termination\n- Emergency Preparedness and Planning\n\nThe Woodburn Distribution Center does not have a designated emergency response te"

The Woodburn Distribution Center Emergency Preparedness Coordinator maintains the Emergency Planning and Response Guidelines for the facility.\n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response Guidelines provide the response protocols and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which have been implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. The Guidelines are reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperature, two stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of 366 TR-30?F/low stage, and 653.6 TR +18?F/high stage.\n\nThis refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an overfeed ratio of approximately 4:1. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system. The engine room electrical classification is NEMA-1.\n\nThis facility contains six separate ammonia refrigeration subsystems:\n\n1. Low temperature system (-30?F @ 1.7 in.-Hg)\n2. High temperature system (+18?F @ 31.4 psig)\n3. High pressure receiver system (95?F @ 181.1 psig)\n4. Condenser system (95?F C.T. 69?F W.B.)\n5. Compressor low temperature system (-30?F @ 1.7 in.-Hg)\n6. Compressor high temperature system (+18?F @ 31.4 psig)\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nThe most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation. The EPA's RMP*Comp Dispersion Modeling Software and the SLAB Dispersion Modeling Software were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm. The result shows that off-site ar"

The EPA's RMP*Comp Dispersion Modeling Software and the SLAB Dispersion Modeling Software was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, the WinCo Foods Woodburn Distribution Center has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make this type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the Company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analyses appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative (\"cautious\") analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n- Spray systems; provide a significant capability to emergency responders to scrub ammonia vapors from the air should there be a release.\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process exist.\n- Diking and floor drains in the Engine Room would provide containment for liquid releases.\n- The SLAB Dispersion Modeling results showed that the release traveled a shorter distance; however, the more conservative (\"cautious\") RMP*Comp results were used.\n- Although the regulations allow use of a less conservative \"urban\" topography assumption for the alternative relea"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The PSM Program was inspected (during the course of the preparation of this RMP Submittal) and was found to meet or exceed regulatory requirements, as well as reflect a spirit of interest in the health and safety of employees and the Community, as well as for the environment.\n\nThe Woodburn Distribution Center has been diligently applying key Accidental Release Prevention Program elements since the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard:\n\n- Process Safety information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractors\n- Emergency Response\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of ammonia at the WinCo Foods Woodburn Distribution Center since the"

These studies include the following: Process Safety Management (PSM), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and Hazard Assessment. In addition, PSM Compliance Audits are currently planned to address PSM and RMP Prevention Program requirements. All outstanding recommendations from these previous studies will have been implemented by September 15, 2004."
