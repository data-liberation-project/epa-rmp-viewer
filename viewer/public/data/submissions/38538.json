These manuals contain procedures for the following:\n\n* Hazard Communications Program\n* Respiratory Protection\n* Hearing Conservation\n* Use of Personal Protective Equipment\n* Safe Ammonia Handling Procedures\n\nAll personnel receive training in health and safety upon employment.  This training includes instruction in the following areas:\n\n* Safe hazardous materials handling and storage procedures\n* Use of personal protective equipment\n* Fire prevention and fire fighting procedures\n* First aid\n* Procedures and requirements for storage and handling of compressed gases\n* Procedures for use of heavy, overhead, and otherwise dangerous equipment and    machinery\n* Lock Out / Tag Out procedures\n* Symptoms of acute exposure to hazardous materials\n* Heat stress\n* Accident reporting\n* Procedures to follow in the event of a natural disaster such as earthquakes, wind storms, lightning storms, etc.\n* Working with electrical equipment\n* Operation of fire fighting equipment\n\nManagement commitment to the inspection program includes not only the implementation of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that define the inspections to be conducted, but also the response to deficiencies that compromise the risk reduction practices identified and implemented under the RMP.  Management must be willing to change procedures to provide better systematic support of risk reduction practices.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe KES Kingsburg, LP (Kingsburg Cogeneration Facility) is a combined cycle cogeneration plant located at 11765 Mountainview, Kingsburg, CA 93631.

It also contains immediate and supplementary actions to be taken.  These actions are identified in outline form, supplemented with precautions to be considered during the response.  Each procedure also contains an emergency call list specific to the response.  Site personnel, business neighbors, site ownership and regulators are included in the call list, as are medical contacts.  Site personnel are trained annually on all emergency response procedures, and the contact lists are reviewed on a monthly basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nKingsburg Cogeneration will continue to improve safety at the facility by:\n\n* Continued training and involvement of site personnel\n* Routine review of site operating and maintenance procedures\n* Maintaining adequate supply and condition of personal protective equipment\n* Maintenance of system integrity via Management of Change\n* Periodic review of recommendations founded in the HazOp process\n* Completion of root-cause failure analysis in incident investigation\n* Performance of scheduled auditing of the Program"

Padlocks are placed on the fill, vent, and drain lines such that sabotage to the unit would be difficult.  Proper emergency procedures, as outlined in Section 10 of the Emergency Response Plan would be implemented, however, in the event that this release scenario should occur.\nThe most probable release scenario, based upon facility history, would be a release due to the failure of the ammonia evaporator rupture disc due to carryover of liquid fluid.  The carryover would cause an increase in pressure, rupturing the disc and causing the evaporator relief to lift.  \nA scenario similar to this would not result in a release off-site as the system could be shut down and repaired with parts held on site in spares inventory.  The next most likely scenario is a pipe fitting failure at the storage tank.  This scenario was modeled in the alternative release scenario.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nMention rules and regulations you comply with (PSM)\nHighlight practices that are important to prevention program:  systems, procedures, training\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) was promulgated on February 24, 1992 and became effective May 26, 1992.

The PSM is designed to minimize the likelihood of a catastrophic release of designated hazardous materials.  The plan includes sections on:\n\n* Employee involvement\n* Process safety information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training, both employee and contractor\n* Pre-startup safety reviews\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Hot Work Permits\n* Management of Change\n* Incident Investigation\n* Emergency Planning and Response and\n* Compliance Audits\n\nKingsburg Cogeneration also has in place approved and proven operating and maintenance procedures"

The elevation of Route 99 is approximately that of the facility ground level.\nThe plant produces electrical power, and supplies steam for operation of the concentrator process as well as the thermal host's processes.  The remaining electrical power, after satisfying the facility auxiliary energy needs, is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).\nThe plant consists of the following major equipment:\n* Combustion turbine generator (CTG)\n* Heat recovery steam generator (HRSG)\n* Steam turbine generator (STG).\n\nThe plant also has the following ancillary systems and equipment that support its operation:\n* Fuel gas system\n* Condensate system\n* Feed water system\n* Steam system\n* Demineralized water supply system\n* Cooling water systems\n* Compressed air system\n* Anhydrous ammonia storage tank and delivery system\n* Cycle chemical feed system\n\nThe plant supplies energy for cogeneration by sending steam to the concentrator process as well as supplying process steam to the thermal host.

This solution is volatilized into anhydrous ammonia vapor prior to injection into the boiler.  The anhydrous ammonia is consumed by the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.\n\nWorst-case scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\nThe air dispersion model proposed in the work plan was the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) public domain version 1.07 of the RMP* Comp.  This model implements Section 1 of the 1990 Clean Air Act.  RMP* Comp was developed by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous Materials Response Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Division of the USEPA.\nA worst case release scenario was considered for the OCA.  It is briefly described below.\n* A catastrophic failure of the storage portion of the system which would release anhydrous ammonia (CAS #: 7664-41-7) into the atmosphere.  The material is held in a storage tank in a liquefied form under saturation pressure.  With release duration of 10 minutes, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L, based upon ERPG-2, with an air temperature of 77F (25C) and wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour (1.5 meters per second) was calculated.\nAn alternate case release scenario was also considered for the OCA.  It is briefly described below.\n* A failure of a storage tank fitting with a one (1) inch diameter would release anhydrous ammonia (CAS #: 7664-41-7) into the atmosphere.
