      "SummaryText": "This remote Alaska seafood processing facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, above a safety standard threshold of 10,000 pounds, to freeze and store seafood products.\n\nThe facility refrigeration system uses standard materials, components, and good engineering, manufacture, and industry guidelines to provide overlapping layers of protection and automatic and manual correction and mitigation of operating deviations.  System changes have been changes in kind and have not required Management of Change or Startup Review.\n\nThe quantity of ammonia refrigerant used in this facility requires OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Level 3 Risk Management to assure the mechanical integrity of this refrigeration system and the health and safety of on-site employees and off-site public and environmental receptors. \n\nOne on-site injury resulting from the release of less than one pound of ammonia and no off-site ammonia related incident resulting in an injury, death, property, or environmental damage occurred during the 1994-1998 period covered by a Five Year Accident History prepared for Risk Management.  The cause of the on-site injury was employee error in failing to follow correct maintenance procedures, and a review of maintenance procedures and protective equipment was employed to prevent a reoccurrence of this event.\n\nA ten minute unmitigated worst case release of 24,000 pounds of ammonia and a ten minute unmitigated alternative release of 4,000 pounds of ammonia were scenarios selected from EPA models and data to illustrate ammonia plume dispersion.\n\nEPA Risk Management requirements have been integrated into an existing community emergency response plan based on 1994 State of Alaska sponsored hazard analysis recommendations for Akutan, and into a facility action response plan."
