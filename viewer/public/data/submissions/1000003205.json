A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to ensure the safety of  employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that  have been designed and implemented, including:\n\nl    A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\nl    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\nl    An overview of accidental release prevention programs\nl    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\nl    An overview of the emergency response program\nl    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring\n                      and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\nl    The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\nl    The detailed information (called data elements) about the risk management program\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Jacksonville facility produces aroma and flavor chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The facility consists of 54 acres in a predominantly residential and commercial neighborhood. The main processes are distillation and catalytic reactions. The chemical in use  that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, are as follows:\n\nToxics\n\nNone, although Ammonia and Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride are present at the site, the quantities do not exceed the threshold es"

This information is available to authorized individuals involved in local, state and federal emergency planning activities. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility maintains several programs and practices designed to minimize the possibility of accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management per 29CFR1910.119\nEPA Risk Management Plan per 40CFR Part 68\nIntegrated Contingency Plan which includes  all types of emergency planning  as required by EPA, OSHA regulations. \nInspections and Preventative Maintenance\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of monoethyl amine from the site since it was first introduced to the plant in drum quantities in 1978\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for  emergency response planning. The program provides the essential planning and training  for effectively protecting the employees, the public and the environment during emergency conditions. The plan is available to the Local Emergency Planning Council and to Responders for coordination with the community plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has a systematic program for rev"
