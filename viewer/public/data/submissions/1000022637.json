The preparatory effort consisted of the review of current P&ID's and block flow\r\ndiagrams, process safety information, and identification of all components. The plants were divided into\r\nnodes during the P&ID review.\r\n\r\nThe team was assembled and PHA training was completed prior to performing the PHA. The purpose of the\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis and the methods to be used were discussed.  Members of the PHA Team were selected on the basis of those who might offer the most experience and resources to conduct accurate analyses of the covered process. Specific job experience was considered when assembling the Team so that Management, Operations and Safety were adequately represented. The PHA was conducted the week of May 2, 2011.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe objectives of the Process Hazard Analysis conducted for the Airgas North Central Propylene process was\r\nto review all hazards of regulated substances, processes and procedures. The team utilized the HAZOP\r\ntechnique to identify opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that could lead to an\r\naccidental release.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nStationary Source is Propylene. \r\n\r\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\r\nA catastrophic failure of the propylene bulk tank could lead to the release of all propylene in the bulk tank.\r\nA catastrophic failure of the bulk tank could be caused by impact of a large forklift or truck; or by the\r\ncombination of a truck pull-away and an engineering control failure. Accidental release amount would be\r\n43,860 pounds of propylene. Bollards have been installed to block traffic from coming into contact with bulk\r\ntank. Delivery trucks are equipped with breakaway connections.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nThe most likely accidental release would be caused by the failed installation of a pressure relief device or\r\nvalve on a pro"

[68.155(a)]\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n2.5.2 The stationary source and regulated substances handled? [68.155(b)]\r\nPropylene is the regulated substance that is managed at the Airgas North Central fill plant in Ankeny, IA.  Airgas North Central trucks pick up returned (empty) propylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propylene is stored at the stationary source in a large bulk tank.  Propylene is transferred from the propylene bulk tank into propylene cylinders.  The full propylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas North Central to customers.\r\n2.5.3 The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps? [68.155(c)]\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention processes that are specific to propylene and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n2.5.4 The five-year accident history?"

The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.
