As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, security, and environmental protection.  Monument Chemical Kentucky, LLC has been certified by the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA) to have been accessed and found to be in conformance with the requirements established by the CHEMSTEWARDS&reg; Management System.   Monument operates under the philosophy that all accidents are preventable all of the time.  A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as to protect the environment.    \r\n\r\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in practice at the Brandenburg facility.  Also attached are the data elements from our risk management program that are required by EPA's RMP rule.\r\n\r\n2.0\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n    The Monument Chemical Kentucky, LLC Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site located east of Brandenburg, Kentucky.  The facility is divided into 8 operating units including Propylene Glycol/Glycol Ethers, Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities, Waste Water Treatment, and Warehouse/Shipping.  The primary products manufactured at the facility include polyether polyols, propylene glycols,  glycol ethers, and microelectronics chemicals.  \r\nIn our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n*Ethylene Oxide - purchased and used in the production of polyether polyols and ethylene glyco"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios and our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\r\n\r\nToxics:  Worst Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nEthylene Oxide:  The selected worst case release scenario assumes the failure of a railcar containing up to 170,000 pounds of ethylene oxide.  The required assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes.    Using the USEPA RMP*Comp software, rural topography and stipulated meteorology of wind speed of 1.5 m/sec (3.4 mph) and F stabili"

A release of this magnitude could potentially impact area residences and schools in Meade County as well as residences in Hardin County, Jefferson County and Harrison County, IN.  Environmental receptors within this 11 mile radius include Otter Creek State Park, the Fort Knox military base, South Harrison State Park, and Mosquito Creek Nature Conservatory.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of a release of the largest quantity from a vessel that has the potential for the farthest off-site impact.  Passive mitigation in the form of dikes or collection drains were not considered for this release scenario.  Although the facility also has active mitigation controls including sprinkler and deluge systems that would be utilized in a release of this type, they were not considered in the consequence analysis for this \"worst case\" release scenario.\r\n\r\nToxics:  Alternate Release Scenario\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP rule, more credible alternate release scenarios were also considered for each toxic chemical.  This scenario is often called the planning scenario because we use the information to develop our detailed emergency response plans.  While a number of scenarios are considered for each of the chemicals covered by the RMP, only one for each toxic chemical is presented.  All scenarios were evaluated using the USEPA RMP*Comp software and the stipulated alternate weather conditions of 3.0 m/sec (6.7 mph) wind speed and D stability class.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde:  The more credible alternate release scenario for formaldehyde considers a leak in a 1.5 inch line.  The line has isolation valves at each end which will be manually shut by operators required to oversee all material transfers.  Approximately 38 pounds of formaldehyde would be released over a ten-minute period.  The for"

The resulting plume would remain onsite and would not include any public receptors.\r\n\r\nEthylenediamine:  An evaluation of credible releases of ethylenediamine (EDA) from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for EDA considers a transfer hose rupture.  Because of shutoff valves at the tank truck and the storage tank, no more than 120 pounds of EDA would be spilled.  The resulting plume would remain onsite and would not include any public receptors.\r\n\r\nEthylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ethylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the Polychemical Unit area.  Approximately 370 pounds is released during a 10 minute period.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public. The resulting plume would remain onsite and would not include any public receptors.\r\n \r\nPropylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for propylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the Polychemical Unit area.  Approximately 2,270 pounds is released to the air during a 10 minute period.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  The resulting plume would remain onsite and would likely not include any public receptors.\r\n \r\nAcrylonitrile:  The more credible alternate release scenario for acrylonitrile is a leak from an unloading hose from a tank truck.

Approximately 830 pounds of liquid acrylonitrile would be spilled during a 10 minute period, resulting in a plume that could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing en"

Liquid ammonia is spilled to the ground and 415 pounds is released to the ground and air.  The release lasts for approximately 10 minutes and travels a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.

A USEPA contractor RMP Audit was conducted at the Brandenburg facility in March, 2012.  A Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) was completed during 2004 with the assistance of the Meade County Local Emergency Planning Council (LEPC) and the site SVA was then updated in 2016.  A variety of recommendations are being implemented as a result of our participation in this program, including:\r\n\r\n1.\tIncreased operator training for emergency response activities.\r\n2.\tContinued drills to include the local fire department and LEPC.\r\n3.\tContinued capital equipment upgrades for existing facilities to prevent chemical releases.  \r\n\r\n8.0\tCertification\r\n\r\nFor all Program 3 covered processes at the Monument Chemical Kentucky, LLC facility, the undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in this Risk Management Plan is true, accurate and complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignature:\r\nName/Title:  Jody Caines, Health, Safety & Environment Manager"
