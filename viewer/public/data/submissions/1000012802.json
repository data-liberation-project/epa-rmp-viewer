If a accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia received, stored, and distributed.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the Ameraican National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standard of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911, and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n     We provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under     SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  We conduct yearly safety meetings, safety equipment checks, and check emergency spill equipment procedures. "
