Our refrigeration system \n\nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\n\nand standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\n\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes\n\nelements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\n\npoints in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\n\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\n\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\n\nrefrigeration system to identify the\n\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\n\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\n\nrefrigeration equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\n\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\n\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\n\nof the refrigeration system.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are\n\nscreened to verify that they are within the original safe design\n\nlimits.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we\n\nconduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new\n\nequipment has been designed and ins"
