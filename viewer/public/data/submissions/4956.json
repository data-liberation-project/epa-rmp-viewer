Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at National Frozen Foods Corporation are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Albany Fire Department who provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary SLource and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 40,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from national Frozen Foods Corporation's Main Plant Ammonia Refrigeration System.  The scenario involves the release of 8038 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 803.8.  A distance to endpoint of 2.8 miles is obtained which affects a residential popula"

The scenario involved the release of 1700 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of .31 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 195.\n\nThere are no Flammables Worst-Case or Alternative-Case scenarios for this process.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings releated to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, National Frozen Foods Corporation maintains written operating procedur"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 yeaars and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occassion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  national Frozen Foods Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan:\n\nThis facility is included in the written community ER plan.  This facility has its own written ER plan.  The ER plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The ER plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The ER plan includes information on emergency health care.\n\nDate of most recent review/update of ER plan:   4/14/1999\nDate of most recent ER training of employees:    5/18/1999\n\nThe local agency coordinating the ER plan is the Albany Fire Department which has the phone number 541-917-7700.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We will continue our annual plant evacuation drills.  In addition, we conducted a joint emergency drill with Oregon Freeze Dry and the Albany Fire Department on May 18, 1999.  This drill enhanced our mutual aid capabilities in the event of an accidental chemical release."
