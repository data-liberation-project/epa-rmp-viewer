      "SummaryText": "The Chesterfield Power Station is an electric utility generating facility, which burns coal, distillate oil and natural gas to generate electricity.  The facility uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's Regional NOx SIP Call, as implemented through the Commonwealth of Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule (9 VAC 5 Chapter 140, Rev D98) and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas.  The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nChesterfield Power Station has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program. The facility's ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Chesterfield Power Station's operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is further trained in emergency operations.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, piping system, and emergency shutdown systems.  These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Furthermore, Chesterfield Power Station ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, a root cause failure analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur.  Chesterfield Power Station has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.  Because t"

      "SummaryText": "he ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, audits and inspections are performed periodically to identify changes to improve safety.  These changes are evaluated and implemented as required by the regulation.  Chemical safety training through first aid, emergency contingency plans, Hazard Communication, and PPE programs reinforce the criticality of chemical safety to operations personnel.  Beginning in January 2017, a third-party was contracted to conduct monthly inspections of the system.  The emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility.  Chesterfield Power Station has confirmed our inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nThe facility had a release of ammonia on January 9, 2017 when the packing in a recirculation control valve failed to seal due to extreme cold weather.   The release was detected by its odor.  No injuries or property damage occurred as a result of the leak, and no evacuation was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The Chesterfield Power Station has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does not (is not required to) have an emergency response plan meeting OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER); accidental releases that cannot be corrected immediately by employees who are within the immediate release area will be referred to the Chesterfield County LEPC/Emergency Services contact."
