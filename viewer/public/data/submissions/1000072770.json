As part of this commitment, the Arkansas Pulp and Paperboard Division in McGehee, Arkansas, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility. One component of this system is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Clearwater and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan Rule (the Rule).  One of the requirements of the Rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at Clearwater. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Clearwater.\n\n\n\n2.0  REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nClearwater is an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 345 full-time workers. Clearwater produces approximately 950 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates a coated paperboard machine.  To support these operations, Clearwater handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the Rule: chlorine and chlorine dioxide. \n\n\n\nThe Rule requires all regulated toxic substances contained in 40 CFR 68 that are stored in quantities above the specified thresholds to be included in an RMP.  Chlorine is present in pressurized containers above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds at four distinct locations and chlorine dioxide is present in a chilled aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds.  The regulated use of these substances at Clearwater is summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1.  Summary of Covered Processes.\n\n\n\nProcess\n\nDescription        Program Level    Regulated Substance    Maximum Process Quantity\n\n\n\nChlorine Dioxide "

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Clearwater does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that both might occur at a facility similar to Clearwater and would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred. By identifying these potential releases, Clearwater has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected in the event of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.  The offsite consequence analysis can be found within the Hazard Assessment Documentation section of the RMP.\n\n\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (PROGRAM 3)\n\n\n\nSince Clearwater's inception in 1977, the mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, Clearwater formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to "

The following sections briefly describe the elements of Clearwater's Program 3 prevention program that address the Rule prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nTo ensure the safety of our processes, equipment complies with good engineering practices and a variety of technical documents are maintained.  These documents address:\n\n?    physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n\n?    chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances, and\n\n?    design basis and configuration of the equipment.\n\n\n\nClearwater ensures that this process safety information is available to all Clearwater employees and local fire and emergency response personnel and that the process safety information is kept up to date.\n\n\n\nSafety Data Sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Clearwater, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes. SDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available to mill operators for ready reference.  The SDSs for covered processes include the information outlined in 40 CFR 68.65(b).\n\n\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process. The available information includes:\n\n?    operating parameters,\n\n?    block flow or simplified process flow diagrams,\n\n?    process chemistry,\n\n?    maximum intended inventories,\n\n?    safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure or flow,\n\n?    consequences of deviation from established operating limits,\n\n?    design basis and configuration of equipment (materials of construction),\n\n?

A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process. \n\n\n\nClearwater primarily uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) to perform this analysis as allowed by the Rule under ?68.67(b)(4).
