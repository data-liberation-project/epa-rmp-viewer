This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident of a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping and equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include conducting training, developing written procedures, performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our strategy, consistent with written operating procedures, is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel and/or specially trained outside responders will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nCITGO Refining and Chemicals Company L.P. is a refiner, transporter and marketer of transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, refined waxes, asphalt, and other industrial products.  CITGO Corpus Christi Refinery supplies high octane gasoline, diesel fuels and petrochemicals.  The refinery consists of two plants, the East Plant at 1801 Nueces Bay Blvd., and the West Plant at 7350 IH37.  The West Plant refinery has several regulated flammable substances, such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, propanes, butanes, pentanes and flammable mixtures. The refinery also uses and/or processes toxic substances, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide, methyl mercaptan, and ammonia.  No toxic materials are present above threshold quantities in any processes.   \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement t"
