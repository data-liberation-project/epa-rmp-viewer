Engineering and technical upgrades and improvements also impact sound and reliable systems.  Censors, alarm systems, and varying levels of human monitoring provide ongoing prevention and early detection.  Internal/ external audits, inspections and record keeping are active systems for evaluation - revealing gaps and determining areas for improvement.\n\nEmergency action plans, hazard communications, and emergency evacuation programs address awareness, alarms and the safe response of employees to potential leaks.  Evacuation drills, emergency response training, response drills and involvement with the Fulton Fire Department, the Oswego County Hazardous Materials team, and other outside agencies,  furthers our ability to respond and effectively contain and mitigate potential releases.\n\n\nThe Birds Eye Foods plant in Fulton, NY is a fresh/frozen vegetable packaging facility linked to a large cold storage warehouse"

The plant receives vegetables that have been previously frozen at another another facility and package them into retail sizes and prepare them to be shipped to markets across the United States.  Several of the products produced  require sauces or other ingredients, such as pasta or bean sprouts, to be added.  These items are made and flash frozen at this facility.  \n\nRefrigeration is required to maintain a high quality product during the process and packaging operations.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at quantities above the reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant of choice for several reasons:  It is economical and efficient to use, and it provides low operating temperatures that are needed for rapid freezing of the product.  Also located at this site is a 100,000 square foot 0 degree cold storage warehouse and shipping facility.  The warehouse is also cooled through the use of anhydrous ammonia.   The site contains 60,000 pounds of ammonia in total.\n\nSafety programs and procedures have been developed to decrease the amount of hazardous chemicals being used at the plant in an effort to reduce the risk of possible releases to the environment.  Compliance to environmental responsbilities is achieved by the assignment of responsibilities to the plant management staff.\n\n\nThe Birds Eye - Fulton facility is subject to and and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  As such, the plant resides within the Prevention Program for Program 3 Processes of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nEach of the PSM components are followed and used toward safeguarding and prevention.  Levels and releases of all types are documented and evaluated for future prevention.  When practicable, engineering enhancements are made as equipment is restored or new equipment is put in place. \n\nThe Fulton plant had one release of ammonia in the last five years that met the five year release criteria (r"

      "SummaryText": "eported in Section 6).\nThe reportable ammonia release occurred on November 18, 2003, when a fork lift operator backed into an ammonia cooling unit mounted from the ceiling in the production cold storage facility.  The fork lift mast pushed the fan blades into the fan coil, causing a release of 934 pounds of ammonia.   The ammonia from the coil sprayed directly on totes of product stored beneath the cooling unit.  The plant was evacuated and the Fulton Fire Department was called in for assistance.  The ammonia was contained on site within the production cold storage facility.  There were no injuries or fatalities.  Root cause analysis of the incident was determined to be operator error.  The operator was relieved of fork lift duties and immediately retrained in fork lift and job duties.  Approximately 227,000 pounds of materials valued at $130,000,  was sent to the landfill due to incidental contact with liquid ammonia and residual ammonia odor.\n\nIn the event an ammonia event occurs, the factory's first response team is activated.  The team is made of up of 12 facility associates and is trained to Hazardous Materials Technician/ Level A standards.  Three individuals have also been trained in the Incident Command program.  The team trains twice yearly with the Fulton Fire Department with the most recent drill conducted on May 2, 2004.   The Fulton Fire Department would notify the Oswego County Hazardous Materials Team for any situations requiring further assistance."
