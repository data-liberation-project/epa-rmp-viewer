Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nFXI, Inc. - Brenham is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nFXI, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Brenham, Texas. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in three (3) storage tanks; (1) 10,000-gallon, and (2) 5,000-gallon TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area.  At times TDI is also stored in an 20,000 gallon railcar until loading occurs.  Therefore, the total combined physical volume onsite is approximately 40,000 gallons.\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the Off Site Consequence Analysis, facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Pro"

Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\nFXI, Inc.is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \nFXI, Inc.'s specific prevention steps include:\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc.to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public,"

      "SummaryText": "rather a basis for any specific actions.\nA release from a 20,000 gallon railcar has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  The catastrophic release would release approximately 204,400 lbs. of TDI. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.15 mile for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are approximately less than two thousand sixty two people in nearby industrial and residential setting that may be within the potentially affected area.                    \nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  FXI, Inc.has determined that the most likely alternative scenario for the facility is a process piping release (flange leak or failure in process line) from the process line carrying TDI from the tank to the pouring head.  The leak would release approximately 1,080 lbs of TDI.  The RMPComp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario.  The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are approximately fifty (50) people residing within the potentially affected area.\n\n          \n          \nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nProcess Safety Information: FXI, Inc.has completed a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review has been conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \nHazard Review: FXI, Inc.will update and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and every five (5) years.
