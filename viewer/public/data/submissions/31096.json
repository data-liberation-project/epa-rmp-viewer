The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which are implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.                                                                                                                            \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY                                                                                                                      \n\nAll previous recommendations generated from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) dated March 1999, have been completed and in use. Mitigations from the US Foodservice 3 Year Safety Audit (OSHA) were duly noted and have been incorporated into the program. All future recommendations will come from the Emergency Response Team thru scheduled walk thru's or changes to the facility."
