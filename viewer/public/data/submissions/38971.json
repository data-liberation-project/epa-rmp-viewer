Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Navajo Refining Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur Artesia facility's primary activities encompass Petroleum refining.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane, Propane and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid].  Butane is used for Alkylation Unit feed and gasoline feed stock.  Propane is used for Alkylation Unit feed and LPG product.  Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] is used to enhance the alkylation reaction.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Butane at our facility is 6,846,042 lb. while Propane and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] are present at our Artesia refinery in quantities of 716,513 lb. and 115,600 lb. respectively.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from HF Alkylation.  In this scenario 13,900 lb. of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid]"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] involves a release from HF Alkylation.  The scenario involves the release of 13,900 lb. of hydrogen fluoride.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by a water deluge system.  This active mitigation system has the effect of reducing the release by approximately 90% (i.e., to 1,390 lb).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/L of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid] is 0.37 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Butane Bulk Storage.  In this scenario 1,983,744 lb. of Butane is released.   It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 1.01 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Butane  Bulk Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  The scenario involves the release of 18000.00 lb. of Butane in  minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is 0.10 m"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nNavajo Refining Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Navajo Refining Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nNavajo Refining Company has maintained our excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum and decreased in number from the 8 incidents reported under the original 1999 RMP submittal.\n\nThere have been 2 accidental releases of regulated substances (i.e., those for which RMP reporting is triggered for Navajo's Artesia refinery) from our facility within the last 5 years.

(<176 lb. after mitigation) of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid], occurred on 10/14/2002.  Onsite, there was one injury. The active mitigation (i.e., water deluge system) contained the release to the battery limits of the process unit.  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  \n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nNavajo Refining Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nEddy County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nNavajo plans to continue improving and enhancing our already effective safety program.  This established successful system is already in place to prevent and respond to accidental releases.  Therefore, it is not surprising that no new courses of action have been identified by the Risk Management Plan.  However, the ongoing process whereby Navajo review and evaluates new information will continue to result in ever improving refinements to our existing Safety Program."
