              "Description": "3.0 Prevention Program Summary\nThe Prevention Program for the H. C. Morgan Pollution Control Facility has one covered chemical process, chlorine.  The process is subjected to regulation under OSHA process Safety Management and the requirements of this regulation has been met.  The following is a brief narrative of the programs in place at the facility.  The Risk Management Program includes Prevention Programs for:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Program, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, and Emergency Planning and Response.  There are written programs that are applicable to each of the efforts outlined.\nThe Employee Participation Program details who and why employees are to participate in the element of the prevention progress.\nThe Process Safety Information includes Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower parameters, equipment specifications, and standards used to design, build and operate the process.\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Program identifies hazards associated with the regulated substance, possible opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error, and steps to detect or monitor releases.\nThe Operating Procedures Program includes procedures currently utilized by the plant personnel for initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change.  Included in these procedures are consequences of deviation, steps to avoid and equipment inspections.\nTraining of employees at the plant is strictly enforced. All employees must complete an annual chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety course conducted by a qualified person. Plant employees must maintain a valid Waste Water- Grade IV certificate.  Records of these training efforts are maintained in the employee files.\nThe Mechanical Integrity Program includes preventative maintenance activities: inspection, testing and evaluation.  Additionally it ensures good engineering practices are followed.  All maintenance employees and contracted employees are fully trained on the process.  Of significant note is that maintenance of the two covered processes is delegated to specifically trainer contractors.\nA Management of Change Program ensures that any process technology or equipment change is highlighted and reviewed prior to implementation.\nThere is a viable Incident Investigation Program; although there have been no significant incidents at the facility and no incidents involving the concerned chemicals.\nCompliance audits have been conducted by representatives of the company (corporate), as well as the State of Alabama Department of Environmental Management.  \nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Program is viable.",

Morgan Pollution Control Facility for the city of Auburn, Alabama.  The facility is an activated sludge/extended aeration sanitary wastewater treatment operation that is located on the southwest side of Auburn, Alabama, 616 Sandhill Road.  This site consists of approximately 40 acres located in a rural setting ( bounded by low density residential units).  The site has an elevation of approximately 450 feet above sea level and the natural flow of surface water appears to be to the south toward Parkinson Mill Creek, a tributary of Chewacla Creek.\nThe H.C. Morgan facility treats the majority percentage of the sanitary wastewater for the City of Auburn and the site is regulated under the State of Alabama NPDES Permit # AL0050237.  The process at the plant utilizes both mechanical and biological treatment to remove organics from the wastewater, prior to returning the water to the general environment.  As part of the processing effort chlorine gas is utilized in contact with the flow stream to ensure coliform removal.  The chlorine gas is stored and is placed into service in a chlorine contact building, which is isolated from the remainder of the plant.  Also, in this building, there are no more than two cylinders in proximity to one another.  Operators are thoroughly trained in the handling of the hazardous chlorine.\nA review of the process indicates that the worst case scenario is the release of a one ton cylinder that is being placed into service, plus a small amount of a second cylinder that is in service.  The release would allow gaseous chlorine to migrate off plant site to the south-southwest, toward some distant farm residents.  The envelope of expansion will be some 1.1 miles.  The most likely alternative scenario is the release of a partially full cylinder, less than 2000 pounds, with the same flow pattern and traveling some 733 yards in the sa"

In both cases the emergency response involves activation of the Local Emergency Response Program.\nThe site has a Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) program in place that includes the following elements:  Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audit, Management of Change, Prestartup Safety Review, Contractors, Employee Participation and Hot Work Permits.  These programs are utilized for the entire plant operation and for the specific chemical chlorine.  The efforts of the site prevention program have been successful with no incidents having occurred during the past five years.  However, should an incident occur the site has developed an emergency response program that involves the local public safety department (fire and police), the local HAZMAT team and other support agencies.\nIn the future the already successful program will be maintained to ensure the continued protection of the local population and environment. Additionally, new technology is being considered which would allow the plant to discontinue the use of chlorine (5 to 10 year timeframe)."
