It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Truro Fire Department (via 911 calls) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Madison County Emergency Management Agency and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources will be made. If there is a Reportable Quantity (RQ) release a call will also be made to the National Emergency Response Center.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it was planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., anhydrous ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for Truro Grain is Willie Jacobe, operations. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour) emergency response numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n        Willie Jacobe\n        WORK:        (641) 765-4285\n        24-hour:    (515) 577-4409\n\n    Steve Swackhammer\n        WORK:        (641) 765-4285\n        24-hour:    (515) 238-8027\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE / DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REG"

      "SummaryText": "ULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT TRURO GRAIN.\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other miscellaneous equipment. From time to time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on this basis. At a minimum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company is one (1).\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.    \n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPAA?s RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to endpoint is 2.8 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage tank without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPAA?s RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nThe system is protected from major release by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoff valves, and remote emergency shutoff valves. The loadout riser used to fill nurse tanks is protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Truro, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1-1989 with amendments and State law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Truro Grain has extended to the Truro Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia facility, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTruro Grain has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to immediately notify the Truro Fire Department and the Madison County Emergency Management Agency to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Truro Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to the emergency, the fire department(s) with which Truro Fire Department has mutual aid agreements will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and with the Madison County Emergency Management Agency.

      "SummaryText": "onia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to portable nurse tanks. In so doing they are able to detect visible problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies visible portions of the system which may be under stress and about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to the annual training of employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.\n"
