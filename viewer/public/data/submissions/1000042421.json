Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at the Village of Northbrook, Illinois, Water Filtration Plant (the Facility) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we will coordinate with emergency responders to provide trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n                                                                                                                                                                            Northbrook 's primary activities encompass production of potable water.  Disinfection of water via chemical means is of utmost importance in the water production process.  To assist in the disinfection process, the following regulated substance(s) are present at the Facility.\r\n\r\n          Substance:  Chlorine\r\n          Maximum Inventory:  14,000 pounds (seven one-ton containers)\r\n          Exceeds 40 CFR Part 68 Threshold:  Yes\r\n\r\n3.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a combination of \"what-if\" questions and a detailed checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years, or more frequently if necessary.  Any findings related to each analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to the covered process, the Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, alarms, c"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a standard practice at the Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nAll staff believe that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.
