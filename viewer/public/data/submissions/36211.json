It was determined that the RMP regulations applied since the facility has received an RMP regulated Toxic Chemical since August 19, 1996 in quantities that exceeded the threshold level.  The facility manages hazardous waste derived fuels which are used to replace fossil fuel consumption in the manufacture of Portland cement.  The facility has decided to prepare and submit a RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.\n\nThe Toxic Chemicals, vinyl acetate monomer, methyl mercaptan, acrylonitrile, allyl alcohol, titanium tetrachloride, propionitrile, toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) were selected to be addressed in the RMP Plan preparation based on applicability determination.  The process involved at the facility includes handling, storage and blending in tanks and transfers from containers such as tank trucks and rail cars.  The facility was not eligible for Prevention Program Level 1 since screening level modeling, using highly conservative assumptions showed the potential for offsite consequences owing to the proximity to other industrial sites and offices.  The facility is not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations or one of the nine designated SIC Codes and thus excluded from Prevention Program Level 3.  Consequently, the facility was deemed to be under Prevention Program Level 2.  This submission is predictive in nature since the subject chemicals are not always on-site.\n\nHolcim management is committed to safe operations at the facility.  The company has an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy that clearly commits company resources to maintaining safe operations protective of human health and the environment.  The facility also has an active Community Advisory Committee to provide an avenu"

No additional changes to the site?s safety systems are required or anticipated to allow continued handling of these chemicals.\n\nAlthough the facility is exempt from the OSHA PSM regulations, the management voluntarily implemented portions of the standards when the hazardous waste storage tank farm was built.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was concluded on October 27, 1999.  The facility meets or exceeds the Prevention Program Level 2 requirements for Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits and Incident Investigation.\n\nThe facility is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as a commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility.  The existing Contingency Plan meets and exceeds the RMP regulatory requirements for the written Emergency Plan.  Local emergency planning agencies have been cognizant of the facility activities, reviewed the Contingency Plan and agreed in writing to provide assistance in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe Holcim management welcomes inquiries into our operations, and looks forward to answering any questions that the public may have.  Please contact the emergency contact identified in this plan if you have any questions."
