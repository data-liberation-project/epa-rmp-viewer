      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the Columbus Water Works' (CWW) policy to operate safe water and wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the North Columbus River Pump Station.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities\nWater treatment.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are odor control and iron removal.\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine at Pump Station:  \nTotal Amount Stored:  2 one-ton containers, equivalent to 4,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe North Columbus River Pump Station is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What-If\" analysis.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe North Columbus River Pump Station has never had a release of chlorine resulting in offsite dispersion or property damage, or in injuries onsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe CWW has implemented an Emergency Response Program that applies to the North Columbus River Pump Station, which coordinates response efforts with the local fire department's Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Georgia Emergency Management Office.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed "

      "SummaryText": "during the hazard review that the North Columbus River Pump Station has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system.  During the most recent hazard review, the hazard review team made the following recommendations for improving the safe operating procedures and for minimizing the likelihood of an offsite release from the chlorination system:\n1. Require personnel entering the chlorine building to carry a mouth-bit escape respirator and chemical safety goggles while in the building;\n2. Require operators to complete crane operator training before transferring one-ton containers using the hoist system;\n3. Require hoist inspections that follow ANSI and OSHA guidelines;\n4. Require operators and maintenance employees to complete the Chlorine Institute Training Program, \"Safe Handling of Chlorine\"; and\n5. Require a hot work permit system for any cutting and welding inside the chlorine building."
