Hermiston Foods uses anhydrous ammonia to freeze its fruits and vegetables.  The ammonia is stored on site in a liquid form.\n     Hermiston Foods complies with rules, regulations, and recommendations from OR-OSHA, ASME, IIAR, EPA, DEQ, PSM, etc.  Hermiston Foods also keeps full time refrigeration engineering personnel on site to monitor, operate, and maintain the equipment and process.  The refrigeration engineering personnel receives on the job training as well as off site training dealing in the maintenance and safety of the equipment and of the process.\n     Hermiston Foods has not had an ammonia release resulting in an off site consequence since the plant started using anhydrous ammonia in 1990.  \n     Hermiston Foods has set up emergency evacuation plans for the plant.  These plans would go into effect with the local emergency responders.\n     Hermiston Foods uses safety committees, on the job training, safety seminars and safety training to identify and improve overall safety at the facility."
