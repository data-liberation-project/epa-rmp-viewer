If an emergency occurs it is our policy to contact the CORTLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of af agronomy cortland location and the regulated substance handled:\n     The primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authotized contractors.\n\n3.  The worst case scenerio:\n     We used rmp comp to determine the worst case scenerio release at our facility.  Failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  The alternative release scenerio is based on the most likely incident to occur wich is a break in a transfer hose.  The excess check valves and manual shutoff valves should keep the release to a minimum in the alternative scenerio.\n\n4.  AF AGRONOMY COMPLIES WITH EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29cfr 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.  Five year accident history:\n     We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n     In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous"
