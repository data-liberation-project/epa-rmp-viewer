Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous materials.  The properties of the material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia; the safety devices and system designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the CSDS facility to charge the central refrigeration system, provide product cooling during processing in silos and tanks, produce ice for a ice bank used for the chilled water generation for process uses, and provide cooling and freezing areas in the cold storage warehouse.  The majority of the anhydrous ammonia equipment is located in and around the Mechanical Equipment Room and the cold storage warehouse. The system is totally contained and the only losses of ammonia requiring delivery of makeup quantities are from small fugitive emissions at valve stems and pump seals, residual ammonia gas pumped out of a section of the system prior to maintenance or repair; small amounts of ammonia gas lost during manual purging of air and removal of oil from the ammonia, and discharges from relief valves.  Operation of the system is automatic through controllers that sense level, temperature, and pressure at various points in the system.\n\n\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substance are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n\n\n3a.  Administrative Controls\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia rel"

This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the anhydrous ammonia systems and the training provided to the refrigeration system operators.\n\n\n\n3b.  Mitigation Measures\n\n\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the refrigeration system with the anhydrous ammonia and its related equipment and components.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Stockton Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) for the RMP that are being implemented at this time.
