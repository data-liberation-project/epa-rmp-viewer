If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the bulk facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi trailer holding 41,000 pounds.  There is one 12,000 gallon bulk tank that holds 52,548 pounds at 85%, which is the most you can legally fill the tank.  There are 6 nurse tanks on site (@ 1,000 gallons each) and they combine for a total of 26,214 pounds.  This makes the total on site 78,642 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternative release have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns and the Homeland Security.  \n\nThis facility has implemented an annual training program where all employees who work with anhydrous ammonia learn safety information, hazards, operating procedures and most importantly the maintenance of an NH3 plant.  Above all the employees use goggles and the appropriate gloves while filling nurse tanks.  \n\nThe Anthony Farmers Coop can report that there have been no injury accidents within the last five years at this facility.  This company has a written emergency action plan that is shared with the Harper Volunteer Fire Department.  This plan contains maps and emergency procedures in the event of a release or an emergency.  \n\nThere are no improvements, repairs, or upgrades needed or expected in the near future.  \n\nThis plant is inspected annually by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and is designed and maintained in strict adherence with all local, state and federal rules and regulation.
