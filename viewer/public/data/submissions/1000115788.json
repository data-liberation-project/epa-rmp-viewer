To achieve these certifications, a third-party auditor conducts a formal pre-assessment followed by a final certification audit in order to certify that our management systems are functioning and conform to the international environmental standards for ISO 14001 and the ACC Technical Specification for RC 14001.  \n\nThe Lubrizol Painesville facility has integrated health, safety, environmental, and security (HSES) responsibilities and accountability into the organization.  We believe that ownership is at the operating level and that safety is everyone's job.  We are committed to operating our facility in compliance with applicable HSES laws and consistent with Responsible Care(R).  This is the philosophy that we communicate to our employees and that provides the grounding for our daily operations.  We believe that this philosophy is critical to our progress and a key contributor to the continued success of the Lubrizol Painesville facility.\n\nAs part of the safety program, all new employees go through a safety orientation program.

The training facility, which is housed in a renovated old production building, provides employees the opportunity to train in a plant environment on safety procedures such as hot work, line breaking, confined space entry, and lockout-tag out.\n\nMultiple layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases. Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards. Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up. Maintenance and inspection programs are conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process safety program includes a measurement of performance, audits, and implementation of corrective actions. This continuous management of the system assures that safety is always the top priority.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, we have a trained and certified emergency response organization staffed 24 hours a day to immediately react and mitigate the emergency. In addition, if we need additional assistance, we have an established working relationship and direct communication with the local Lake County Fire Departments.\n\n\nThe facility and the regulated substances handled:\n \nLubrizol Painesville is a specialty manufacturing facility.

The field evaluation for this joint drill was completed in December 2022 following the Lake County LEPC meeting. A tabletop exercise focused on a release of an RMP chemical is being planned with the Lake County Hazmat Team and members of the LEPC in July 2024.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nAn updated global health, safety, environmental, and security incident reporting system was implemented in April 2021. This system documents the incident and includes information on the root cause and mitigation measures along with the individual responsible for implementing the corrective and preventive actions. A system is in place to review progress towards completion of the corrective and preventive actions and to check the effectiveness.\n\nSafety meetings and training are held on a regular basis to review these incidents to update employees on topics that will improve the overall health, safety, and environmental aspects of our facility and surrounding community.

The program includes a cross functional team of employees that support risk assessments and awareness objectives related to ergonomics. Over the past four years the site has been able to eliminate or reduce risk on 146 tasks.\n\nAll the RMP covered processes undergo a process hazard analysis (PHA) in accordance with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements to identify any potential hazards. If there are recommended actions from the PHA, projects are initiated to address the recommendations as part of the facility's capital improvement process.  Past projects related to RMP regulated processes have included upgrades to fire suppression systems and distributed control systems (DCS), level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, installation of sensors to detect a chemical release, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines, cybersecurity protection measures, and installation of additional emergency equipment.\n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosophy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community."
