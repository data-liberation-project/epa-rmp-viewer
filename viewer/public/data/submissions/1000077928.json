The regulated source at this facility is the anhydrous ammonia storage and delivery system up to injection points. This substance is listed as a Regulated Toxic Substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and is present in quantities that exceed the threshold for Accidental Release Prevention. \n\n\n\nActagro's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is the primary goal of Actagro's management. The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\n\n\nActagro's policy in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of ammonia is to contact local emergency agencies for assistance as well as necessary contractors needed to respond, clean up and restore facility functions to normal. Actagro adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Osceola facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule through the implementation of the Process Safety Management rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases.

The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. Preventative maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident. All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia is prevented.\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nActagro's maintains an Emergency Action Plan, in lieu of an Emergency Response Program. Their policy is to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Actagro has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by Actagro and the local authorities will decide on whether local areas will be evacuated. The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary. \n\n\n\nSince, the Actagro facility is included in the community emergency response plan and maintains appropriate mechanisms to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response, according to 40 CFR 68.90, the facility does not have to comply with 40 CFR 68.95 and does not have to develop an emergency response program.
