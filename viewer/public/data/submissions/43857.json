As part of this commitment, COY has established a system to help ensure safe operations of its regulated processes.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMProgram) that is designed to manage the risks at COY?s regulated facilities. Additionally, COY's Risk Management Plan (RMP) complies with all requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program; the California OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards; and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.\n\nCOY?s RMP consists of these three major elements:\n1. A hazard assessment to aid in understanding the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and an assessment of accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMProgram Rule.\n2. A prevention program to assist in maintaining and safely operating any processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance from the covered process.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in COY's RMP.\n\nAlthough this RMP assists COY in providing assurance that the Water Pumping Station (WPS) facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of their overall safety program.  In fact, COY has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against the release of a hazardous substance, and injuries and damage resulting from a release of a hazardous substance. Additionally, COY has a Safety Director who initiates safety committee walkthroughs, and obtains ou"

Before using a hazardous substance at COY's WPS facility, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used, COY considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect their employees, the public, and the environment, and takes steps to prevent such effects.\n\nCOY works to prevent hazardous substance releases (chlorine gas) from its treatment facility.  The WPS facility is very well maintained, and the facility and process equipment were designed, built, and are being operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards were adhered to in the original design, construction, and operation of the facility and its process equipment, and current regulations are adhered to in new designs, construction, and operations of the regulated processes.\n\nCOY limits damage from a release, if such a release should occur, by training specific employees to respond to an accidental release.  In addition, COY works closely with the COY Fire and Police Departments, the Shasta Cascade Hazardous Materials Response Team (SCHMRT), and the Siskiyou County Environmental Health Department (SCEHD) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimal, if a release from a regulated substance should occur.\n\nThe safety program at COY consists of a number of elements that conform to CalARP Program 3 requirements.  \n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCOY is committed to the safety of its workers, the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous and regulated substances.  COY implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure saf"

If an accidental release occurs, COY will revise Sections 5 and 6 of the RMP to include information about the accident and the related incident investigation and provide it to EPA within six months.  Additionally, the expected date of completion of changes due to the accident investigation will be incorporated into the RMP and submitted to EPA within six months of the accident.\n\nCOY provides response training to specific personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the COY Fire and Police Departments, the SCHMRT, and the SCEHD.  COY and the Fire Department conducted an emergency response training exercise on February 28, 2005, and will be conducting an additional emergency response training exercise in the near future. COY responders will also be required to be certified for using respirators, and the proper PPE for responding to a release from the regulated substance.\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, COY has established a management system headed by the Public Works Director (Emergency Response Coordinator) along with the Water Manager, which have oversight for the WPS facility to oversee safety-related and emergency response activities.  These Managers all report to the City Manager.\n\n1.2 COY?s Regulated Substances Handled and Source Information\n\nCOY?s WPS facility serves the City of Yreka and a few adjacent communities surrounding the area.

The complete off-site consequence analysis is presented in Appendix A of the RMP, and for safety reasons the OCA maps should not be released without prior approval from the City of Yreka.\n\n1.4 Mitigation Measures\n\nCOY has implemented administrative controls and mitigation measures at its facilities in order to minimize the potential of an off-site release or, in the event of a release, the quantity of the release.\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the COY WPS facility, which were considered to mitigate the severity of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, include COY?s policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine systems.  Active mitigation measures include timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel who will be following the established emergency response procedures.  \n\nOther mitigation measures in place at the facility include:\n?

These documents address the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at their facility, operating parameters of the systems, and equipment operating procedures for these processes.  COY ensures that this process safety information is available to its employees and the outside emergency responders.\n\nInternational Chemical Safety Cards are produced by the international safety community and are cosponsored by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  This resource is intended to provide health and safety information for workers potentially in contact with regulated substances.  The International Chemical Safety Cards for chlorine are provided in Appendix B of the RMP. \n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at COY, including chlorine gas used at the WFP facility. The MSDSs for chlorine gas is presented in Appendix B of the RMP.  The information available on the MSDSs for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n? toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n? physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n? reactivity and corrosivity data\n? thermal and chemical stability data\n? hazards of mixing substances in the process\n\nMSDSs for regulated substances handled at this facility are available at the Water Managers "

On February 8, 2005, Pioneer conducted a site visit, and on March 4, 2005 they provided COY with a list of safety recommendations, which are in the process of being implemented.  Pioneer also assists COY in implementation of its preventative maintenance program, and as required, they will make repairs and/or install new process equipment, or replace existing equipment if found to be defective or worn.  \n\nCOY?s WPS facility has chlorine gas leak detectors located near the floor in the chlorine process room, which will signal those that monitor the SCADA computer system, and also any on-site personnel.  If these alarms are not acknowledged within a specific time, the on-call operators are called at their contact number outside of work and notified. The on-call operators are within a 25 to 45-minute response time of any of COY?s facilities.    \n\nCOY has plans to install emergency shut down systems at the WPS on-line chlorine cylinders.  Automatic shut-off valves will be located on the downstream side of the flexible pigtail connection at each cylinder that will shut down the systems upon sensing low pressure in the piping downstream from this valve.  If a release occurs downstream of the vacuum switchover valve (vacuum loss), the valve will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Air-supplied respirators are located outside the chlorine process areas at each facility (see map, Appendix B of the RMP).\n\nAt the WPS facility, two one-ton chlorine cylinders are strapped onto their saddle supports, which are bolted to the slab (per design drawings).  Additionally, a ventilation system can be energized if a chlorine gas leak has been detected.   \n\nAt the WPS facility, process piping systems and supports appear to be installed per the required standards, and pipe supports are securely mounted to solid structures.
