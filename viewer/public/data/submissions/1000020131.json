      "SummaryText": "Floracraft  has expanded its extruded polystyrene foam  manufacturing capability. This has necessitated the installation of  bulk storage tanks for the blowing agents  to be able to operate efficiently with the increased consumption. The blowing agents are classified as regulated as stipulated in the RMP rule as they meet the criteria as flammable liquids under pressure. The  blowing agents are ethyl chloride, isobutane and difluoroethane. They are stored in  three horizontal cylindrical pressure vessels  approximately  that contain approximately 10,000  - 12000 gallons.\n\nDue to the quantity  of the regulated  materials stored on site, the  extruded foam manufacturing faicility  must meet  the requirements of OSHA and EPA for the prevention of  uncontrolled spills of regulated materials. The EPA rule is called Risk Management Plan  (RMP) and the OSHA  rule is called Process Safety Management (PSM).\n\nThe installation of the tanks is also covered by the National Fire Prevention  Association  code , Specifically NFPA 58. The tanks and associated equipment  have been designed, installed and inspected to ensure 100% compliance with this rule.\n\nIn addition gas detectors have been  strategically located in the storage and processing areas to ensure that  the smallest of leaks of the regulated  materials used are detected  quickly. \n\nRemotely Operated isolation valves have been installed to allow for  the safe shutdown and isolation of equipment  by operating personnel  to minimize the amount of flammable material that can leak to atmosphere.\n\nAn emergency plan for the site has been developed and communicated with the local fire department  and has been integrated in to the local Community Emergency Response Plan.  Material  Safety Data sheets will be included with the emergency plan so that  first responders understand the hazards associated with the materials.\n\nThe process meets the requirements of  EPA's Risk management Program Level 3. All requirements of Program Level "

The owner has a history of commitment to the community as well as sensitivity to the impact of Floracraft's operation on its neighbours. To this end, Floracraft has exceeded the requirements of codes such as NFPA 58 so that the risk from releases of the  regulated materials is significantly decreased.\n\n"
