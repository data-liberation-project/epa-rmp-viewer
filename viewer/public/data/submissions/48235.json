Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Solvay Fluorides, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement  controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSolvay Fluorides, LLC primary activities encompass the manufacture, processing and sales of brazing flux for industrial uses. They are used in the manufacture of automotive heat exchangers.\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance, 70% Hydrofluoric Acid present at our facility.  Hydrofluoric acid is used for the source of fluoride ion in the brazing flux.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed worst case and alternative scenarios in accordance with 40 CFR 68. Distances were calculated using RMP*Comp Version 1.07 for worst and alternate release scenarios. The distances for the worst case and alternate case scenarios have been corrected to reflect that liquid 70% Hydrofluoric Acid would be release and not gas and that 70% HF is now being received in rail cars.  Given the state of current events, this information is being withheld from the Executive Summary, as the USEPA considers this (FR 69 vol. 69, pg 1 8819-188832) security sensitive information. \n\n \n\n4.
