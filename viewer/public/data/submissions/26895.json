      "SummaryText": "The Cotter Corporation Canon City Uranium Milling Facility employs certain processes which prompt Level Two Program development in response to Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  Specifically, Cotter stores and uses anhydrous ammonia in quantities which exceed the threshold reporting criteria.  Annual use of anhydrous ammonia is variable dependent on the state of production. The received fluid is stored in either of two tanks which hold 78 and 38.6 tons, respectively.  In order to prepare for emergencies involving the release of various materials (including anhydrous ammonia) Cotter has prepared an overall site emergency response plan.  Within the plan, Cotter has outlined its response plan for chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia.  The infromation provided in this RMP submittal is specific to anhydrous ammonia and is not intended to report information relative to other materials on the site.\n\nIn addition to the above, Cotter has provided (in July of 2001) specific training to plant personnel related anhydrous ammonia and, in February of 2002, incident command system training was provided to local emergency responders and key Cotter personnel by a certified instructor. The incident command training included utilization of Cotter\u00bfs site-specific emergency response plan and apprised attendees as to the presence of chemicals and their location on the site and any response needs relative to the materials. In addition, as an element of Cotter Radioactive Materials License renewal process, the emergency plan is again being updated, with anhydrous ammonia contingency planning remaining an essential component within the plan.\n\nThe worst case accidental release scenario for anhydrous ammonia at the mill site would involve spillage of the entire stored content of the largest storage vessel.  The material would be released as a neutrally bouyant gas over a ten minute period.  Administrative controls to prevent and/or minimize releases included tank inspections a"

The distance to a potential cehmical exposure point for members of the public is maximized by site fencingwhich prohibits entry to the site.  In the case of anhydrous ammonia, the nearest residence is approximately 1,100 meters from the ammonia storage location.  Due to the nature of the site, large with restricted access, Cotter did not complete an alternative analysis because the alternative choice would not result in offsite consequences, such as the real case reported below under accidents.\n\nAs an element of this reporting Cotter has presented information about releases of anhydrous ammonia within the last 5 years.  One such incident occurred and was reported here, but in quanities less than the reportable quantity.  Releases of materials other than anhydrous ammonia are not included here.\n\nCotter's overall emergency response program for spilled chemicals includes provisions for emergency notification, site assessment, spill containment, corrective action and site cleanup.  Determining added spill prevention needs is also an element of the response program."
