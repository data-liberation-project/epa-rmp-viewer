Barnard\nCudahy, WI 53110\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employee's that Patrick Cudahy Inc., is complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation, Title 29 Code of the Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulations, Title 40 code of the Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. Patrick Cudahy's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage. \n\nPatrick Cudahy's safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \n\nPatrick Cudahy's safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of Patrick Cudahy Inc. through training and documentation.\n\nPatrick Cudahy Inc. is a processing and packaging company that utilizes approximately 83,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping area's.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario, failu"

The vapor could travel as far as .22 miles. Mechanical deterioration of an ammonia pump seal was chosen as an alternative release because of its higher likelihood that it could occur. This scenario even though potentially possible, is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\nEmergency shut-down procedures\u0005\nRegular maintenance seal and valve upgrade\u0005\nInspection and rounds made daily of the process system to ensure safe operation\u0005\nEmergency response plan and refrigeration personnel on-site around the clock\u0005\n\n\nPatrick Cudahy's accidental release prevention programs are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, American National Safety Standards, and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration  (2 - 1992).
