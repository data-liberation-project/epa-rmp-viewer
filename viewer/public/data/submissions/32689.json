Maintaining the preventative maintenance program is key to Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Plan.  Equipment used to process, store, or handle anhydrous ammonia is to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of such chemicals and is frequently inspected by trained personnel.\n\nThe first line of defense for Americana Foods is the quality of its employees and management systems.  Employees are responsible and motivated in safe operations of company equipment and systems.  They are trained to utilize appropriate work practices to operate and maintain the refrigeration system as designed and to contain all forms of anhydrous ammonia.  We also operate with an open line of vertical communication so that operational problems observed by first line operators and maintenance personnel can be openly communicated to the level of management within the company that can allocate necessary company resources and ensure prompt response.\n\nIt is our goal to provide training to every associate about the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and the safeguards built into the refrigeration system.  This will ensure that even an employee who does not work near the refrigeration system will be aware of the possible danger and know how to react to any incident that may occur.\n\nSenior management is committed to the implementation of safe operating procedures and maintenance of the refrigeration system.

For general operations, the facility simply shuts off recirculator pumps and supporting compressors throttle back and shut down \u00bf a consequence of reduced refrigeration load.  For refrigerated storage, compressor rooms remain on or in standby mode to maintain temperature set points.\n\nEach compressor is equipped with check valves to prevent backflow due to system pressure when that unit is shut down.  Compressors are operationally sequenced so that in the event a single unit trips-out due to electrical / mechanical failure other units in that engine room pick up the lost load.  In the event the system load exceeds the capacity of the available compressors, no mechanical damage occurs as only refrigerator set points are not maintained.\n\nThe only exception to the inherently safe design of the system are vents from overpressure safety valves.  Compressor pressure reliefs, pressure switches and temperature cutouts are internal thus an anhydrous ammonia release is not expected.  However, vessel overpressure safety relief valves (primarily holding tanks, recirculators, separators, and heat exchangers) must vent to the atmosphere in the event one or more internal pressure reliefs or safety switches fail.  This type of release is minimized by the preventative maintenance program and regular system inspections.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAmericana Foods has had no reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.\n\nEmerge"
