The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and safe work practices.\n\nDFA-Cabool has established an Emergency Response Program that provides for trained personnel on call in the event of a release.  DFA-Cabool is also coordinated with the Cabool Fire Department and the Texas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nDFA-Cabool has an excellent safety record in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia.\n\nFacility Information\nThe DFA-Cabool facility processes and packages dairy related products.  DFA has on site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for employee comfort.  DFA-Cabool is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDFA-Cabool has an accidental release prevention program to prevent and minimize the effects of a spill or release of ammonia.  This program includes a training program for all operators and maintenance personnel, written maintenance and operating pro"
