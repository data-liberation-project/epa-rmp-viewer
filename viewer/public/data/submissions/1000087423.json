              "Description": "The Clifton Water District utilizes chlorine in the water treatment process as an added component to disinfect conventionally treated water prior to delivery to the public for use as a potable water source.  The chlorine chemical feed process is housed in a detached post-treatment chemical building that was put on-line in December 2004.  This hardened facility was designed and constructed to all current State of Colorado and Chlorine Institute requirements.  It also includes security upgrades identified in the District's recently completed Vulnerability Assessment submitted to the EPA.  The chlorine storage room has one one-ton container `on-line' and one on stand-by.  There are up to three full containers stored awaiting placement in the operational rotation.  The volume of chlorine is above the threshold values for reporting under the RMP requirements.  Adjacent the storage room (separated by a firewall) is the chlorinator equipment room.  Beyond this room is the chlorine scrubber for use in the unlikely event of a chlorine leak.  The two containers that are `on-line' are connected via a vacuum switch-over unit with individual automatic robo control shutoff units.  One container feeds until empty then the system automatically changes over to the other full container.  The system is always under negative pressure which greatly reduces the chance for release during normal operations.  The storage, chlorinator, and scrubber rooms are alarmed and have continuous leak detection monitoring.  The system is on a routine monitoring regimen by treatment plant personnel as well as continuous monitoring by the treatment plant's secure SCADA system.  In the event of a leak, the SCADA system automatically shuts down the chlorine feed system, activates the scrubber, and notifies personnel, either via the onsite alarm system or the off-normal hour auto dialer.  Specific activity procedures are in place for off-normal hour emergency notifications.  The treatment staff is thoroughly trained regarding the hazards and risks associated with chlorine use to themselves as well as other staff and the general public.  Specific regulatory operational and maintenance procedures are in place and strictly followed.  Treatment staff check the chemical feed system on a daily basis (and document all actions and activities) and a scheduled maintenance program is in place and followed.  The alarm system is both auditory (buzzer/horn) and visual (strobe).  Specific off-normal hour procedures are in place and all treatment staff is trained to carry out those procedures.  The immediate vicinity of the treatment plant is security fenced with an automated coded access gate.  Fire department emergency personnel have the access codes for 24 hour unrestricted site access.",

The Clifton Water District (CWD) utilizes liquefied chlorine in the treatment of water for use by the public.  Chlorine is on the list of hazardous chemicals covered by the threshold limits within the CAA.  The requirements presented in the CAA regarding processes that utilize hazardous chemicals identify specific safety precautions regarding handling and storage of the listed hazardous chemicals.  The Clifton Water District has specific release prevention and emergency response procedures in place to help prevent chemical exposure to water treatment personnel as well as the general public, given the life, health and safety hazards associated with liquefied chlorine.  It is the policy of the Clifton Water District to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules, regulations, and safety precautions.\n\n\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District's Board of Directors and Management that the emergency action response plan utilized by the Clifton Water District is in compliance with OSHA's Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan, 29 CFR Part 1910.38.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) to respond to hazardous chemical releases at the water treatment plant, and to notify all potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Activities\n\n\n\nThe Clifton Water District provides domestic potable water to approximately 35,000 customers located in the unincorporated portion of Mesa County, generally referred to as `Clifton' (roughly the area encompassed from I-70 to the C"

The Clifton Water District processes water from the Colorado River through conventional water treatment practices as well as additional finish water treatment through a process utilizing membrane technology.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton bulk containers by certified chemical transportation companies to the water treatment plant where it is off-loaded into the detached chlorine storage/feed facility.  The chlorine storage/feed facility is enclosed within a hardened `post-treatment' chemical structure.  This structure contains individual rooms for container storage, chlorinator feed systems, and the scrubber unit.  All rooms are separated by fire walls and are fire sprinkled.  The chlorine is fed to the treated water as a part of the final disinfection process prior to delivery to the end user.  The feed system utilizes two one-ton containers that are automatically switched from empty to full via the vacuum manifold system.  The system is on a routine monitoring regimen by treatment plant personnel as well as continuous monitoring by the treatment plant's secure SCADA system.  In the event of a leak, the SCADA system automatically shuts down the chlorine feed system, activates the scrubber, and notifies personnel, either via the onsite alarm system or the off-normal hour auto dialer.\n\n\n\nAccess to the water treatment plant facility is controlled via locked automatic gates and security fencing surrounding the facility.

The original water treatment plant was constructed in 1979 to all applicable codes and building requirements in force at that time.  The plant underwent expansion in 1981 and again in 1997.  Each time the plant was expanded, all applicable codes and requirements were followed and recommended chlorine handling modifications were implemented.  In 1999, the District identified the need for a revamped chlorine handling and feed facility.  This new facility was placed in service in December 2004.  Final project acceptance was completed in May 2005.  The new system equipment and components related to receiving, feed process and final discharge of chlorine are inspected daily by trained plant personnel and maintained and serviced according to equipment manufacturer's recommendations.  The water treatment personnel have been trained to follow specific operational and maintenance procedures while utilizing the chlorine process.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel perform daily checks and inspections of the chlorine handling/storage/feed system.  The facility has a complete and thorough maintenance schedule system in place.  This system is current with the facility components installed as a part of the facility.

Specific activity procedures are in place for off-normal hour emergency notifications.  In January 2010, the District received notice that the chlorine container valve configurations were required to be changed from the western version to the eastern version.  This conversion was completed by June 15, 2010.  The District participates in a chlorine system external audit program that includes the City of Grand Junction Water Department and qualified third-party vendors.  These audits identify operational and procedural areas that require updates and tracks completion of those required updates.  This external audit was last performed in November 2018 and is scheduled to take place again in October 2020.

The Grand Junction Fire Department's HAZMAT Team was scheduled to tour the water treatment plant with special emphasis on chlorine facility in March 2020, but cancelled the tour due to community activity process limitations as a result of state-wide restrictions resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic situation.  The Grand Junction Fire HAZMAT Team is tentatively scheduled to tour the facility in July 2020 should COVID 19 pandemic restrictions be relaxed.  At that time, discussions will be had regarding establishment of a table-top response exercise to take place before the end of fiscal year 2020.
