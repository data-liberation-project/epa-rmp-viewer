      "SummaryText": "The P.D. George Company is one of the world\u00bfs leaders in the development and manufacture of specialty polymers for application in the electrical and electronic industry.  These polymers are used as electrical insulation in various household appliances, heavy duty electrical equipment, and for automotive applications.  The 21 acre facility has been located in north St. Louis since 1934.\n\nIt is the policy of The P.D. George Company that its employees, its property, the environment, and the general public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of  its operations.  The company\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan is implemented to comply with the overall P.D. George company policy of providing its workers with a workplace fee from recognized hazards.\n\nThis plan is designed to comply with the policy that all potential hazardous conditions remain within plant boundaries so that these conditions will not present a threat to the health and safety of the general public.  It is also P.D. George policy that operations of the plant be developed so as to avoid adverse effects to the environment of the surrounding area during emergency situations as well as during normal operating periods.\n\nThe preservation of life is considered to be of prime importance and, because of this, all procedures are carried out in such a manner as to minimize risk to emergency personnel.  Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions.  \n\nP. D. George personnel are given emergency response training annually and upon receiving any new job assignment.  The training curriculum and course content are based on the task requirements and special hazards associated with emergency situations.  Emergency drills and exercises are  conducted periodically to identify problem areas in the plan, training, personnel, or equipment. A safety coordination team is currently being organized to strengthen the safety program at the facility, as well.\n\nOf the couple thousand raw materials the facility"

      "SummaryText": "manages on site,  Toluene Diisocyanate  (TDI) is the only one that is covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) under 112(r)7 of the Clean Air Act.  TDI is used on site to manufacture  polyurethane wire enamels used primarily by the automotive industry.  \n\nTDI is a liquid at ambient temperature and freezes at 53 F. TDI is received by tank trucks and is offloaded in a diked area to a 12,000 gallon storage tank surrounded by secondary containment where it is stored between 70 \u00bf 100 F.  TDI is handled in a totally enclosed system and is piped to one of several process vessels where it is reacted with other chemicals to form a polyurethane resin.  Once the reaction is complete there is expected to be no free TDI remaining.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined not to have an offsite impact, as determined using The Society of Plastics Industry\u00bfs manual customized for TDI users, based on EPA\u00bfs OCA Guidance. P.D. George has had no accidental releases of TDI in the past five years.  Should a release occur, our Emergency Control Group will coordinate emergency response activities with the local fire and police departments."
