UST is required to address the safety requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 because UST exceeds the 10,000 pound propane threshold.\n\n\n\nThe executive summary provides an overview of facility specific information that was generated during the development of the RMP including but not limited to storage quantities, hazard assessment data, training dates, etc.\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2007, Tighe & Bond met with facility personnel to audit and update the UST RMP as required under 40 CFR 68.79.  During that audit, we determined that the facility recently installed several pit furnaces that utilize hydrogen, which is co-located and interconnected with the propane and ammonia systems. Although ammonia and hydrogen are below regulatory threshold limits for RMP, the facility performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) of these processes that could affect the propane system on May 13, 2008. The purpose of this PHA was to review the potential hazards of the facility?s pit furnaces and determine corrective actions necessary to maintain the integrity and the safety of the system.\n\n\n\nThe RMP electronic submittal form was originally submitted and reviewed by EPA on December 19, 2000 and an updated version was re-submitted on September 13, 2004 and February 4, 2009\n\n2.0    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n\nThe site specific Risk Management Program Coordinator (RMPC) is Tom Cavanaugh.  Please note that the RMPC is a collective term that refers to the overall RMP program managers as well as anyone these individuals may designate to assist them with the implementation of this program.

Appropriate facility employees and outside Consultants were involved in this process.  Methodology used during the PHA was a combination checklist/what-if method, recommended by EPA.  The questions in the checklist were derived from EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis?, the National Fire Protection Agency 58, ?Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code?, and other sources.  A visual inspection of the covered process was also conducted.  A copy of the facility?s EPA mandated RMP and process safety information were also provided during the PHA for reference purposes.

In addition, modifications to existing systems are performed in accordance with manufacturer?s recommendations.  \n\nUST certifies that the propane and other systems were designed in accordance with recognized engineering standards at the time of original construction and during subsequent renovations or modifications.\n\n\n\nThe propane system was also inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis.  UST follows the manufacturer?s recommendations for maintenance and inspection. Osterman?s leases the tank to UST and maintains the propane system and equipment on an annual basis.  Work orders and inspection checklists for the annual work are maintained as documentation of Osterman?s propane system maintenance.  A safe work permit is completed during these maintenance activities. \n\n9.0    MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE \n\nThe facility has established and implemented written procedures to manage any change to the facility or to the process chemicals (e.g., introduction of new chemicals).  This procedure is imp"

      "SummaryText": "lemented by using the Management of Change forms (MOC) found in Section 9.5 of the RMP.\n\n  \n\nThese forms provide a system that evaluates potential changes to the system and potential effects on the process safety operation.  The forms are completed any time there is a change to the process that could affect the overall safety of the chemical system.  There have been changes to the system that include installation of new rotary furnaces and pit furnaces.  These changes have been addressed by updating the PHA and completion of the MOC form.\n\n10.0    PRE-START SAFETY REVIEW \n\nThe facility performs a pre-startup safety review for new or modified facilities.  The checklist found in Section 5 (PHA) of the RMP provides the necessary information to review and evaluate potential modifications to the existing process.  This process is started as soon as possible in the conceptual design of the project.\n\n\n\n11.0    COMPLIANCE AUDITS \n\nComprehensive compliance audits are performed at least every three years, while some specific programs (e.g., operating procedures, lockout/tagout, etc.) are reviewed annually by the RMPC or his designees.  The facility reviews these latter programs during training.  Periodic audits have been completed on September 1, 2004, November 2, 2007, and December 16, 2013.\n\n12.0    INCIDENT INVESTIGATION \n\nThe facility investigates every incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals within 48 hours of the incident.  The standard investigation system for evaluating these types of accidents is included in Section 12.4 of the RMP.  This includes an investigation form that must be completed at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this activity, a group of individuals investigates and determines why the accident took place.  Recommendations for corrective actions are provided, implemented, and documented.  This minimizes the potential for reoccurrence of future similar accidents.\n\n13.0    EMP"

      "SummaryText": "LOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nEmployees are one of the key components in safety management systems.  The facility involves employees for the implementation of this plan as follows:\n\n\n\n* Employees are involved in safety procedure development and the PHA\n\n* Employees are provided periodic training at regular safety meetings\n\n* Safety meetings empower employees to recommend and implement corrective actions\n\n* A process has been implemented to consider employee recommendations\n\nEmployee recommendations are incorporated into H&S procedures, where applicable.  Safety committee activities are documented to ensure employee participation with RMP requirements.\n\n14.0    HOT WORK PERMITS \n\nThis system provides a process whereby each heat producing work activity is evaluated and controlled to prevent fires.  Efforts are made to ensure that the entire facility completes hot work permits if the activity is outside a dedicated fire protected areas (e.g. shop).  This minimizes the potential for catastrophic fires that could affect the propane process.  The instruction and permits can be found in Section 14.0 of the RMP.  UST maintains hot work permits on file for all hot work performed in the facility outside dedicated maintenance areas.\n\n15.0    CONTRACTORS\n\nThe facility informs contract employers of the potential hazards of the process and ensures that they are properly trained.  Before working in and around hazardous processes, these contractors are provided the facility?s safety requirements and notification forms found in Section 15.0 of the RMP.\n\n16.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  \n\nEmployers must establish and implement a plan that deals with emergency situations at the facility to include the handling of small chemical releases.  A standard emergency evacuation plan is available for the facility in the EMS-007 Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.  It should be noted that specific propane emergency measures can also be found in the operating procedures in Section 6.0 of the RMP.\n\n\n\nThis"

The local agencies also receive a copy of the emergency response plan (periodically upon updating) and Tier II forms (annually).  Emergency personnel also tour the facility periodically to familiarize themselves with chemical hazards at the UST.\n\n17.0    TRADE SECRETS \n\nThe RMP provides for protection of trade secrets incidental to the process.  The facility currently has no trade secrets that have been disclosed and, therefore, does not require compliance with this particular area of the standard.\n\n\n\nJ:\\C\\C0408\\RMP\\2008\\08ExSum.doc\n\n- 6 -\n\n\n\n- 1 -\n\n"
