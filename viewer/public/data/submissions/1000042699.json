Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at Cairo Sulfur Products are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Allen County Emergency Services and Cairo Fire Department, which provides highly, trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of sulfuric acid. We have one (1) RMP regulated substance present at our facility in significant quantity.  The substance is oleum, a mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in several uses. Oleum is used for producing sulfuric acid. \r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of oleum that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is 14700 lb. \r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCairo Sulfur Products maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all pro"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (time period).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cairo Sulfur Products maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nCairo Sulfur Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.   Refresher training is provided at least every three   years and more frequently as needed.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nCairo Sulfur Products carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nCairo Sulfur Products conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nCairo Sulfur Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nCairo Sulfur Products truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
