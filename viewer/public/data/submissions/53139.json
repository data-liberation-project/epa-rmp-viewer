Description and Regulated Substances\n\nCalumet Shreveport is a whole crude refinery and petroleum products facility located in Shreveport, Louisiana. Calumet Shreveport uses crude petroleum as their feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including liquefied petroleum gases, gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricating and gear oils, waxes and asphalt. Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in some process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, Calumet Shreveport has 8 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Calumet Shreveport. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by Calumet Shreveport, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n  Employee Participation\n\nCalumet Shreveport encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Keeping employees informed and involved creates a team unity atmosphere.  Employees have participated on "

This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nCalumet Shreveport has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Calumet Shreveport Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  A HAZOP uses a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Calumet Shreveport Refinery assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator may utilize outside contractors that lead PHAs when appropriate.\n\n   Operating Procedures\n\nCalumet Shreveport maintains written procedure"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually certified by the Area Unit Supervisor as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks\n\n   Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Calumet Shreveport has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive basic training and they are later paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least on a three-year cycle.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n   Contractors\n\nCalumet Shreveport uses contractors to supplement its work force during peri"

The first accidental release happened in the #1 Platformer area.  A fire and explosion occurred within and outside of the charge heater.  The unit was in the process of shutting down for catalyst regeneration.  The heater flamed out and ignited from the gas that was fed into it.  There were two employees injuried and no off-site danger to the public.  The second accidental release happened when contractors were vacuuming sour water and hydrocarbon from a tank.  The contractors removed the tank manway causing vapors to ignite from a truck's engine causing a fire and explosion.  Two off-site responders received first-aid and no off-site danger to the public.  The thrid incident occured when the sour crude heater exploded and split the heater on two sides.  There were no fires, spills, releases, injuries nor off-site impacts.  The heater was being restarted as a result of a power failure the previous night.  The fourth incident was 5 to 8 feet of hard pin asphalt was being heated in order to transfer from a damaged tank.  No RQ's were exceeded due to the product.  Calumet and Shreveport Fire Department extinguished fire with foam.  Less than 1000 gallons of asphalt was combusted during the event.  The fifth incident involved an explosion in the Belco Wet Gas Scrubber. This scrubber was used as a SRU tail gas scrubber associated with SRU units. The unit was down and failed equipment allowing flammable gas and oxygen to accumulate within the scrubber.  There was some type of ignition source in the scrubber creating an explosion. There was no fire, or injuries.\n\n5.
