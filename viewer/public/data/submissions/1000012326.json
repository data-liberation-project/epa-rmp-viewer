The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of ice cream and dairy products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a receiver vessel, condensers, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Oberweis Dairy, Inc. (Oberweis) facility located at 951 Ice Cream Drive in North Aurora, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00c2\u00b7\tIntroduction;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tOberweis policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tPrevention Program;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmergency Communications;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00c2\u00b7\tManagement Program\n\nOberweis Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Oberweis; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.

It is Oberweis\u00c2\u00bf policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Oberweis has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nThe Oberweis facility is located at 951 Ice Cream Drive in North Aurora, Illinois and utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, ice cream, and milk products within the facility. \n\nThe NAICS codes for the facility are 311511 and 31152.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to maintain milk and ice cream temperature for storage, packaging, and distribution.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. \n\nThe amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 18,000 pounds.
