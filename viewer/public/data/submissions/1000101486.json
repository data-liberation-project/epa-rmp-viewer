In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel performing maintenance activities receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nCrestwood Services LLC. primarily used the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) technique to perform this evaluation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Montgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nMontgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal maintains written proc"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCrestwood Services LLC. keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., pressure, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Montgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the pro"

      "SummaryText": "Montgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal\r\nCrestwood Services LLC.\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nCrestwood Services LLC., owner and operator of the Montgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Crestwood Services LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Montgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal is utilized to store liquefied propane in four above ground storage bullet tanks. Six compressor units are used to unload tank cars into the storage bullet tanks. The facility includes a sixteen spot rail rack operating two switches per day with a delivery capacity of one hundred cars per day, approximately one million gallons of liquid propane. A four-spot truck rack with can pumps can load four trucks in approximately seventeen minutes. The Montgomery, NY LPG Storage Terminal is serviced by the Middleton & New Jersey Railroad and can operate seven days per week. \r\n\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; propane.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nCrestwood Services LLC. encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA)"
