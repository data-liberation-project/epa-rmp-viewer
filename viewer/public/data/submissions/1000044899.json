              "Description": "CSM Bakery Products is a Bakery/Cold storage facility. This facility falls under the NAICS code 424420. Our safety information was last reviewed and updated August 11, 2011 (Safety meetings are conducted every month). We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association, American National Standards Institute, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards. These standards, and all applicable OSHA standards have been implemented here through written manuals by Environmental Services Group, Inc. The most recent hazard review and update conducted at this facility was October 28, 2013, and corrections/recommendations were completed by November 30, 2013. The main hazard identified during this hazard analysis was the necessity of additional review of maintenance procedures for identification/detection of releases in all areas where a release could occur. To prevent /limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual valve shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, emergency power backup, and grounding equipment. Operating and training procedures were reviewed and revised on December 23, 2013 and January 18, 2013, respectively. The employees of CSM Bakery Products are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training. This training is completed with competency test including demonstration, and observation. The maintenance procedures are reviewed by operators on a regularly basis to ensure proper operation of the refrigeration system. The last time they were reviewed and written out was April 30, 2013 after the system was updated. CSM Bakery Products contracted Environmental Services,Group, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.",

The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold \n\nstorage refrigerant chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in \n\nhandling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing \n\nthe threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia \n\ncombined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Bassett Mechanical. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Dallas \n\nCounty Emergency Planning Commission, 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies, the Dallas Fire Department, then the notification of Derrick Jackson, Maintenance Manager @ 214-548-9709 (24 Hours) of CSM Bakery Products, the Dallas Fire Department and Dallas Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Dallas County LEPC.  \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in storage vessels located in the Compressor room of the facility and outside in the Controlled Pressure Receiver.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves th"

Other associated systems are the liquid feed make up, purge, and condensing system.  Note:  The system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with \n\nthis description. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 10741 Miller Road location is anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 31,173 pounds.  \n\nThis amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of a vessel when filled to the greatest amount \n\nallowed would release 15,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the 10741 Miller Road location.\n\nPassive mitigation was considered for this scenario. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 1.5 miles.  This location is classified as urban due to the amounts of obstructions around the site.\n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility. An estimation, based on the operational flow rate, cross section area of pipe, operational pressure of pipe, and the change in elevation of the pipe. Using the RMP Comp software, a release from this type of pipe would result in a release of approximately 85.1 pounds per minute released into the atmosphere.  This release could be due to mechanical error. This amount of vapor ammonia release would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 miles.  \n\n\n\nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \n\napplicable state codes and regulations. \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services \n\nGroup, Inc.
