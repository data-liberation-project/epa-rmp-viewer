The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane.  Butane is held on-site in piping in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs for blending into gasoline.  The maximum line fill inventory is 77,408 lbs of butane.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Galena Park Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Magellan's policy to notify the Galena Park LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\n\nThe regulated butane blending process in the facility is compliant with all elements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the initial PHA for this facility.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the initial PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the butane blending process at the Galena Park terminal.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is considered a non-responding facility.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to "

The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane blending process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Galena Park Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Terminal Holdings, L.P.\n\n"
