This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Cleveland County LEPC and Emergency Response Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility manufactures materials for use in the electroplating industry.  The facility casts copper and tin, cuts nickel and also formulates inorganic metallic salt solutions for the electroplating industry.  The operations are located in Shelby, North Carolina and housed in a 160,000 square foot facility.  We employ approximately 92 people and operate 24 hours a day five days a week.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility used in the production of the inorganic metallic solutions.  The first substance is chlorine and the second substance is hydrofluoric acid. \n\nThe Chlorine process is a Program 3 process because it is covered under OSHA Process Safety Management rules.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 12,000  lb.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders.  Two cylinders are hooked up to the process and up to a maximum of four additional cylinders are on site at any time. \n\nThe Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) process is a Program 2 process.  The maximum inventory is comprised of four 55-gallon drums of 70% HF.  Only one drum"

      "SummaryText": "is used in the process at a time.  The maximum quantity of HF is equal to 220 gallons.  The HF component in 220-gallons of  70% HF has a weight of approximately 1580 pounds.  The HF process is only done periodically.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and the model EPA Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the HF involve a rupture of one 55-gallon drum of HF spilling onto the floor of the facility.  The release would occur within the facility since loading and transport of the HF is done inside the building.  The scenario involves a release of 55-gallons of HF and in accordance with EPA guidelines, forms a 1-cm liquid pool.  No mitigation other than the spill occurring in the building is assumed.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is to the prescribed toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/l.  No residences or environmental receptors are located within this distance. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for the HF involves a slow leak in the drum while the drum is in the diked containment area.  EPA COMP was used to calculate the release rate for a 0.15 square inch hole in the drum under 36 inches of head.  Mitigation modeled includes the dike, release in the building and neutralization using soda ash.  The calculated distance to the prescribed toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 miles.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for the chlorine involves a rupture in a one-ton cylinder resulting in 2000 pounds release in 10 minutes.  No mitigation is assumed.  The distance to the prescribed toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is calculated as 3.0 miles.  Use of EPA's Landview I"

      "SummaryText": "I and the 1990 Census data indicates a residential population of 13,550 within this radius of the site.  Additionally, a hospital, several schools and parks are located within this radius. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves leakage of a hose connection after connection a cylinder to the system.  The leak would be detected within one minute due to standard loading procedures.  Assuming a hole area of 0.05 square inches and 150 psi pressure yields a toxic radius of 0.2 miles.  No mitigation is assumed and the release duration is conservatively modeled as 5 minutes since connections are checked immediately upon hook-up using ammonium hydroxide, which reacts with chlorine, as an indicator.   No residences are located within this radius according to the 1990 Census data. \n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  \n\n\n4.1 \tChlorine Process\n\nThe Chlorine process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our Chlorine source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nIMC Group maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a what-if analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes"
