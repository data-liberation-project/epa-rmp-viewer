      "SummaryText": "American Gulch Wastewater Treatment Plant (AGWTP), Payson, AZ 85547\n\nThe AGWTP is a 1.7 million gallon per day plant located in the mountain town of Payson Arizona AGWTP took a proactive approach in handling treated sludge by producing a product sold as fertilizer AGWTP is recognized for there commitment for the environment and the community we serve. We take pride not only in our work but the safe environment in which we work.\n\nWe accomplish this by performing a Process Hazard Analysis which aided in the following worst-case scenario:\n\nA ruputure of the 40,000 ammonia anhydrous tank, due to mitigation system, the gas would be reduced to liquid in a retained holding area.  The released duration would be 10 minutes and with the help of our local emergency responders, residence would be advised and no schools would be affected\n\nAGWTP has a excellent safety record and has no Five Year History to report\n\nDue to community involment we have a wonderful working relationship with outside Emergency Responders. We have implemented a Community Response Drill that will begin by the activation of our Emergency Response Plan\n\n1. Asses and initiate \n2. Dial 911 (advise toxic release)\n\nChanges as a result of our process review include:\n\n1. Additional ammonia detector\n2. Increase training drills"
