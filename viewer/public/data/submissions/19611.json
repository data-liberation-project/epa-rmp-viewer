We take pride not only in our work but the safe environment in which we work.\n\nWe accomplish this by performing a Process Hazard Analysis which aided in the following worst-case scenario:\n\nA ruputure of the 40,000 ammonia anhydrous tank, due to mitigation system, the gas would be reduced to liquid in a retained holding area.  The released duration would be 10 minutes and with the help of our local emergency responders, residence would be advised and no schools would be affected\n\nAGWTP has a excellent safety record and has no Five Year History to report\n\nDue to community involment we have a wonderful working relationship with outside Emergency Responders. We have implemented a Community Response Drill that will begin by the activation of our Emergency Response Plan\n\n1. Asses and initiate \n2. Dial 911 (advise toxic release)\n\nChanges as a result of our process review include:\n\n1. Additional ammonia detector\n2. Increase training drills"
