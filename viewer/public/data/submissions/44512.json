      "SummaryText": "The Lloyd\u00bfs Barbeque facility located in Mendota Heights, Minnesota is a meat further processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process beef, pork, and chicken into barbequed food products for distribution to retailers.  For this operation refrigeration of raw material and product is required.  To accomplish this, the plant has an ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAmmonia is contained in this equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  Ammonia properties result in an efficient and effective refrigeration system while operating at reasonable pressures. Ammonia can be detected at low concentrations in the air providing an early warning for correction to potential maintenance tasks.  \n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nA modified Process Safety Management (PSM) type program has been in place at the facility because the refrigeration system contained less than 10,000 pound and because of our proactive concern for having a good ammonia refrigeration management program.  Periodically the plant is inspected by safety and industrial hygiene professionals.  Corporate Safety conducted an audit in September 2005.  \n\nIt is planned to increase the amount of ammonia in the process above the PSM and RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  An acci"

The facility has been expanded and modified several times over the past 10 years.  These changes resulted in upgrading approximately 70 \u00bf 80 % of the ammonia refrigeration equipment including piping, evaporators, high pressure receiver, low pressure recirculator and removing older equipment that was no longer needed for service.  The plant has a preventive maintenance program where 75% of the compressors have been overhauled in the last 5 years and vibration tests are performed every 6 months.  This food processing facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a training program.   This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\u00bf  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\u00bf  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\u00bf  The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\u00bf  A detailed process hazard review (comparable to a process hazard analysis (PHA)) was conducted in 2004.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls a"

This represents the initial facility PHA. The recommendations are being implemented on a time table.  In preparation for increasing the amount of ammonia in the process to more than 10,000 pound, additional process hazard analysis issues were addressed with emphasis on General Equipment, and Human and Siting factors. \n\u00bf  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\u00bf  For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\u00bf  Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\u00bf  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon Federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan has been in place for at least 10 years and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.

These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
