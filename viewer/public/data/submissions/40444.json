The NAICS code we feel most applicable\nfor receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 \"farm product warehousing\nand storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk\nManagement Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural\nuses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as\nwell as all crop protectents and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance\nprograms, however only the Anhydrous Ammomia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distibuted for direct application to farm fields during\nth early and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The\nmaximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is\n314,374 lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 30,000 Gallons, storing 130,000 lbs.  The\nmaximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank\nholding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.  \n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.\nOur facilitiees have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout\nthe year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our"

      "SummaryText": " largest\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 lbs. based on 85\n% tank capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to\n200 ppm) is 4.0 miles based on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public and\nenvironmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency\nPlanning Committee) for their consideration.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual, self closing excess flow, and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06 miles\n(317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  We conduct\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,\nBarriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, pressure relief valves, and valve Lock outs to\nprevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire\ndepartment and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety\ntraining exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.
