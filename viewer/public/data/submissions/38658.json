Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nPiedmont Laboratories is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our Prevention Program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release.  The program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nPiedmont Laboratories is a manufacturing plant that uses hydrocarbon propellant to pressurize aersol cans.  This plant uses a mixture of several reguloated substances.  These substances are composed of a combination of propane, isobutane, N-butane, 1-1 difluoroethane and isopentane.  For simplicity the worst case analysis and alternate release senario were based on the major component of the mixture with the highest heat of combustion.  In the case of the propellants, propane and its properties were used in the analysis.  The maximum quantity of these regulated mixtures at this facility is 738,380 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario and the alternate release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nPiedmont Laboratories believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  The facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards.  By following set operations procedures are maintained routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate in optium conditions.  In addition the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits.\n"

Five Year accident history\n\nPiedmont Laboratories has not experienced any accidents within the last five years that either led to the release of hazardous chemicals or has the potential to lead to such a release.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\nA well planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off site impacts of an accidental release.  Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and natural surroundings.  To this end, Piedmont Laboratories has coordinated emergency response efforts with appropriate local agencies and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nA p-roactive maintenance program will be implemented to ensure conditions integrity process equipment."
