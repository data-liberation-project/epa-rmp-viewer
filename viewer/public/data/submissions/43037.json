      "SummaryText": "Cargill Turkey Product?s chemical accident prevention and emergency response policies for ammonia refrigeration involve the development of this Risk Management Program and Plan (?RMP?) which has a primary objective of preventing an accidental  release of ammonia, and in the event there is one, minimize the consequences of a release.\n\nThe stationary source subject to this RMP is Cargill?s refrigeration warehousing and storage facility located in Mt. Crawford, Virginia.  The facility has two interconnected refrigeration systems which contain anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.\n\nThe location has prepared worst case and alternative case release scenarios using the ALOHA air dispersion modeling software which calculates the distance to the toxic endpoints. \n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility?s ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place"

      "SummaryText": ", property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan which addresses accidental release of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Joint Local Emergency Planning Commission (?LEPC?).  The facility is included in the LEPC?s community emergency response plan. The facility is currently deemed a non ?responding facility under the RMP regulations and the facility?s RMP, which means that the local Hazardous Materials Team, local fire departments, and other local emergency responders have primary responsibility for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  \n\nThe process hazard analysis reports prepared for the facility in February 1998 and in April of 2003 identified various recommendations to minimize the risk of accidental releases and improve safety related to the ammonia refrigeration system.  All of the recommendations from the 1998 PHA have been resolved.  Two recommendations from the 2003 remain open and are scheduled for completion by July 2004."
