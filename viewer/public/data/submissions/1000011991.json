This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive Accidental Release Prevention Program that covers areas such as (but, not limited to)design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training, all associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the local Fire Department, Law Enforcement, and Emergency Medical Services, all which provide additional emergency response information and expertise.\n\n 2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n Our facility's primary activities include support services for agricultural crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored at our facility, in both a primary holding tank(s), as well as supplemental nurse tanks, which are used for product field application.  All of our tanks are filled by skilled, trained employees who do not fill any tank beyond the 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n 3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n (NOTE: #3 Available only to County Emergency Manager, Fire Department and Farmers Union Oil Company - not included with disk to EPA for public access per Federal Regulation posted 2004)\n\n 4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program :\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains a currant and detailed data base of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with"
