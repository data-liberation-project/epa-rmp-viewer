The ERP includes appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is need for a response.  Emergency Response personnel are trained in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.156 and emergency drills are conducted quarterly.  The facility is listed in the community ERP.  An Incident Command System structure is utilized.\n\nAdditionally the terminal is a U.S.  Coast Guard Maritime regulated facility.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess and maintain safety conditions.  Martin has designated personnel to ensure the programs referenced in this Executive Summary are maintained.  Additionally the site has Environmental and Safety personnel to assist in these efforts.\n\nIn summary, the Neches Terminal is committed to implementing controls necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention and personnel training, as well as considering safety as one of the highest priorities in the instal"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\nMartin conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken promptly and safely.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nMartin promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\nThe contractor safety program involves training and records keeping ensuring contractors are aware of process hazards and facility procedures.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nDuring the past five (5) years the Neches Terminal has had four (4) releases, the most notable occurred on September 13, 2020, when approximately 88.8 pounds of Vapor was released from a Railcar PSV.  This release had no health e"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nNeches Industrial Park, Inc. began operations in November 1995.  The terminal was purchased by Martin Midstream Partners LP in June of 2004 and renamed Neches Terminal.  Martin is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. \n\nToward meeting this commitment the facility has in place an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases.\n\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee, General Land Office, Coast Guard and any other state or Federal agencies in mitigating any release and minimizing the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED OR STORED\nMartin stores and handles the following regulated substances:\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS: 7664-41-7)\nStorage Quantity Change:\t69,000,000 lbs (after 10,000-ton Tank T 501 was officially\n\tremoved from service at the beginning of March 2022)\n\nUSES:\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility, with the majority utilized for distribution to end users.  Shipment methods include bulk cargo trailers, rail, and barge.  A small portion of the ammonia is utilized for the on-site production of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), which is considered part of the overall ammonia-PSM operations.  \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the rupture of a 34,000-ton (short) aboveground ammonia storage tank.  EPA rules would not allow use of water for mitigation when calculating our worst-case scenario.  Martin believes that the endpoint distance of 25 miles would be significantly reduced, since the tank is near water.  The endpoint distance was concluded using off-site consequence analysis guidance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based"
