THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLANT IS THE PROCESS OF GREEN BEANS WHICH ARE HARVESTED AND PROCESSED FROM JULY THROUGH AUGUST. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE HARVEST THE AMMONIA IS PUMPED BACK TO PRESSURE VESSELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE OFF SEASON. APPROXIMATELY 20.000 LBS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS ON SITE FOR THIS PURPOSE. DURING THE OFF SEASON A SMALL COMPRESSOR IS OPERATIONAL TO MAINTAIN  ROOM TEMPERATURE AND SYSTEM PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PLANT IS A SYSTEM  DEDICATED TO THE  COLD STORAGE. THIS SYSTEM CONTAINS AN ADDITIONAL 6000 LBS. OF AMMONIA. THE MAJORITY OF THE REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT WAS NEW IN 1991.\n    THE EQUIPMENT IS OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY THREE OPERATING ENGINEERS. THESE ENGINEERS ARE TRAINED IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF ALL REFRIGERATION AND BOILER EQUIPMENT. IN THE EVENT MAINTENANCE REQUIRES MAJOR OVERHAULS SUBCONTRACTORS ARE BROUGHT IN TO ASSIST.\n    THE ENGINEERS RESPONSE EQUIPMENT CONSIST OF  RADIOS,SCBA'S,CANNISTER MASKS,CONFINED SPACE KIT,CLASS A SUITS AND MONITORS. OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS,PARAMETERS, HAZOPS AND SAFETY PROCEEDURES ARE CONTAINED IN THE \"PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT\" PROGRAM AS MANDATED BY OSHA. TWIN CITY FOODS POLICY IS \"SAFETY FIRST\".\n   THE COLD STORAGE AREAS HAVE AMMONIA DETECTION SYSTEMS AND THE REFRIGERATION MACHINERY SPACES HAVE POWER VENTILATION .\n    THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS INCLUDED AS APPENDIX A, THE ALTERNATE SCENARIO  IS INCLUDED AS APPENDIX B. BOTH CASES ARE REPRESENTED AS UNMITIGATED TO AVOID CONFUSION.\n    IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTAIN ON SITE, WE IMMEDIATLY WILL CONTACT THE LAKE ODESSA FIRE DEPT AT 911 AND THE IONIA CO. LEPC AT 911\n    SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF THE REPORT OUR MANAGERS WILL MEET WITH REPRESENITIVES OF BOTH THE LAKE ODESSA FIRE DEPT AND THE IONIA CO. LEPC TO DEVELOP A CO-ORDINATED"
