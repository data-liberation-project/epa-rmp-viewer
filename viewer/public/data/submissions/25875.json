All applicable procedures of the  U.S.  Enviromental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program re adhered to.  The HWWS emergency response policy involves the preparation  of response plans tailored to each facilityand to emergency services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA  Emergency Re\nonse Program requirements. \n\n      \n    The M.F. Runnion Water Treatment Plant (WTP#2) has been installed to disinfect the water flow from the dixieland Reservoir. This water serves the City of Harlingen.  The facility is located on Dixieland Road.  The plant utilizes a chlorinating station, liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety  equipment, an instrument room containing flow recorders, various electrical panels and additional safety eqiuipment.   The amount of chlorine on site is 12 one-ton containers with four on-line, four on stand-by, and four auxillary containers.  Water treatment operators are at the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur. \n\n\n     The off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative release\" scenario.  The first scenario assumes that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is rfeleased gas over 10 minutes\"due to unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"most likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\". \n\n\n       Artmospheric dispersion modeling has  to be performed to determine the distance traveled by  the chlorine   release before its concentration decreases to the \" toxic end-point\" selected by EPA of .0087 mg/L, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2(ERPG-2).
