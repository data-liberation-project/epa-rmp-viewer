The general public would most likely encounter products made from these wafers in integrated circuits found in automobiles, pace makers, telecommunication equipment, and endless forms of electrical switches and controls, both consumer and industrial.   \n\nIn brief and greatly simplified, silicon wafers are made by a process in which crystal silicon ingots are polished to create a defect-free surface.  Then hydrogen chloride is introduced in the Epitaxail Silicon process as a wafer-cleaning agent, followed by trichlorosilane, which deposits another layer of silicon onto the wafer.\n\nIn response to the regulations enumerated by the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules on May 24, 1996, SUMCO Phoenix Corporation - Cincinnati. submits its Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This RMP complies with the requirement to publish its plans to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of the releases that do occur.  \n\nThe Process Safety Management team at SUMCO Phoenix Corporation - Cincinnati  (SPC) has determined that the following chemicals and processes are subject to compliance with the EPA Risk Management Plan:\n\n\u00b7 Hydrogen chloride (HCl), bulk storage and delivery\n\u00b7 Trichlorosilane (TCS), bulk storage, delivery, and reclaim\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe prevention of accidental release of hazardous substances is of major concern for SUMCO employees.  The objectives of SPC's training programs are the preparation of employees to operate equipment properly and safely and to be alert to evidence of accidental chemical leaks and releases. \n\nEvery person working at SUMCO Phoenix Corporation - Cincinnati.

As stated in Standard Operating Procedures 7501P, PSM-Process Safety Management Employee Participation Plan, Process safety is the responsibility of all employees that are involved with processes and systems that affect highly hazardous chemicals.  SPC complies with all preventative safety programs as defined by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.\n\nManagement is committed to employee safety and the implementation of safe procedures.  This is further demonstrated by the approval and support of various Standard Operating Procedures that proscribe specific safety practices, such as Hot Work, Evacuation Plans, and Lockout/Tagout of Hazardous Energies.\n\nManagement strongly supports the selection and training of the Employee Response Team (ERT), whose members are the first responders to any emergency incident.  First established in 1991, the ERT has been at the center of SPC's emergency response programs.  \n\nSUMCO Phoenix Corporation - Cincinnati,  Facility and On-site Regulated Substances\n\nThe EPA has designated hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane as regulated substances.  Regulated substances are defined as toxic and reactive highly hazardous chemicals that present a potential for a catastrophic event at or above a specified threshold quantity. \n\nAs a consequence of these amounts of hazardous chemicals at its Maineville facility, SPC has, over the past five years, continue to improve work procedures and the mechanical integrity program for our operating equipment. During this time SPC continued to audit both internally and externally operation systems to ensure that rigorous safety standards are observed in all phases of its manufacturing operations and that all possible efforts are made to protect the surrounding communities from possible exposure to a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nAccidental Releas"

The ERT Chief, upon receiving notification of an emergency, assesses the situation and determines if the ERT can handle the situation or if outside help needs to be requested.  \n\nThe ERT Chief works with the Safety and Health Manager in planning, developing, and holding training sessions for ERT members.

This training focuses on how to safely and effectively control emergency situations to minimize personal injury, environmental effects, and property loss.  Required refresher training includes hazardous materials technician training, CPR training and basic First Aid for ERT members.  Regularly scheduled meetings provide the opportunity for additional group training in new procedures."
