      "SummaryText": "Per Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the final Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program rule on June 20, 1996.  This rule was published in the Federal Register of June 20, 1996 nd codified in the Code of Federal Regulaitons (40 CFR 68).  It requires owners or operators of a covered stationary source to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999.  The Rule is also known as the RMP Rule.\n\nSenate Bill 1889 requires California to implement the federally mandated Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Effective January 1, 1997, the new California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARP) replaced the California Risk Managemnt and Prevention Program (RMPP).  Under the CalARP program, the owner or operator of a stationary source is required to submit a single RMP to the local \"Administering Agency\" (AA) integrating the federal and state specific requirements.\n\nTo comply with the federal and state regulations, in February of 1999 QST Environmental Inc. (QST), under contract with McWorter Technologies, Inc. (McWorter), prepared and submitted the original RMP plan for this facility, located at 2801 Lynwood Road, Lynwood, California, 90262.   In July of 2000 McWorter Technologies, Inc. was purchased by Eastman Chemical Company.  This update to the RMP plan is being submitted as a notice of the change in ownership, and the change in emergency contacts.\n\nBased on the data collected and federal and state regulations applicability anaysis conducted by QST, it was determined that toluene diisocyanate (TDI) system used in the polyurethsne resin production is the covered process; because the quantity of TDI stored at the facility exceeds the regulatory threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (under federal regulations) and 500 ponds (under California regulaitons) for this chemical.  The facility is subjwct to Program 1 requirements because of the offsite consquence analysis that was performe"

      "SummaryText": "d by QST indicated no offsite impact from the TDI Process.  Additionally, there has been no accident with offsite consequences within the last five years.  The hypothetical worst-case accident for the TDI system is a liquid spill and vaporization that could result in offsite impacts.  Results of the hazard assessment conducted using EPA-approved SCREEN3 model indicate that the furthest distance to the \"endpoint\" of a worst-case is approximately 88 feet.  There are no public and environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone."
