If an emergency were to occur, it's our policy to notify the Minquadale Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: This facility is a hot mix asphalt plant. We manufacture blacktop from crushed stone and liquid asphalt. We use propane to heat the aggregates to the proper mix temperature (275F-325F). The system consists of a 18,000-gallon tank and the associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS: Our worst case scenario is failure of our 18,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2\" diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: This facility complies with EPA'a accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Minquadale Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: None\n\nTo the best of the un"
