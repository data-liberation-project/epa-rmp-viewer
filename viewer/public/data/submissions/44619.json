It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Chlorine is the\nonly chemical which is stored at the site in amounts above the threshold quantity as specified in EPA's\n40CFR68 and the OSHA PSM Standard 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThis facility is a trickling filter, wastewater treatment plant which uses chlorine for a disinfectant as part of the\ntreatment process.  This is one of two treatment plants which serve the City of Warner Robins.  The plant is\npermitted for three (3) million gallons per day and is currently operating at an average of two (2) million\ngallons per day.  Gaseous chlorine is supplied to the plant by a one(1) ton cylinder with one additional one (1)\nton cylinder as storage.  Maximum on-site storage is six thousand (6000) pounds.  The process includes\nchlorinators, injectors, vacuum regulator and associated valves, piping and safety equipment.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and\nregulations.  The chlorine system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-55 and state\nlaw.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental\ndamage, evacuations or shelters in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine system, it is our policy to notify the City of Warner Robins\nFire Department by way of the 911 service and request that they respond to the emergency.  In addition, our\npersonnel are trained in appropriate procedures depending on the type of incident and, if appropriate, will\ninstitute in-house procedures until such time as the fire department can respond to the emergency. We have\ndiscussed this policy with the fire department a"
