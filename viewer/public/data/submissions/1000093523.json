This commitment is integral to the effectiveness of the facility-specific programs and policies developed to prevent an accidental release of hazardous materials. The prevention of accidental releases has been provided for through the development and implementation of design and installation specifications, operating procedures, maintenance programs, employee training, and continuous improvement practices.\r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program intends to prevent the occurrence of a highly hazardous chemical incident or to minimize the potential consequences of an accidental release. In the event of a highly hazardous chemical incident or accidental release, employees, visitors, and contractors are trained to act following the facility-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nReddy Ice-Davie (439) located at 5050 Southwest 51st Street, Davie, Florida 33314, is a packaged ice manufacturing and storage facility. For this facility, the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is utilized as a refrigerant for the closed-circuit mechanical refrigeration system. The closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system provides process cooling for product manufacturing and refrigerated warehouse storage to maintain product quality. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant, although, because of moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical.\r\n\r\nDue to the operating inventories of the ammonia refrigeration system, this facility is covered under Program Level Three [3] requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP regulation"

Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training for the modification.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Incident Investigation element provides the guidelines for promptly investigating an incident that has resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in an unintentional release of ammonia. These investigation procedures identify the situation leading to the incident, determine root-cause, and define any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five [5] years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\nThe Emergency Planning and Response element provides the guidelines for planning and responding to an ammonia incident. Emergency planning and response provisions include procedures for emergency notifications, employee training, and safe evacuation of personnel. All emergency planning and response documents are reviewed regularly for verification of data and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Compliance Audit element provides the guidelines for conducting periodic audits of the PSM/RMP Program to determine whether the provisions set out under the Federal and, as applicable, State regulations are implemented. A comprehensive audit of the PSM/RMP Program is to be completed at least every three [3] years.

Reddy Ice-Davie (439) has not had any ammonia releases that would require reporting as part of the five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an ammonia release incident or emergency, Reddy Ice-Davie (439) has trained its employees to act according to the facility-specific EAP. The EAP includes procedures for the notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the surrounding community, the evacuation of facility personnel, and the first responder duties for trained employees.\r\n\r\nIf an emergency response is required, Reddy Ice-Davie (439) has coordinated with the local area hazardous materials incident response team. This periodic coordination is to ensure local responder awareness of the facility and ammonia refrigeration system, and the limited employee response capacity for the Reddy Ice-Davie (439) facility.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nReddy Ice LLC utilizes the PSM/RMP Program as a continuous improvement practice to enhance ammonia refrigeration system safety through employee involvement, employee training, maintenance practices, and hazard studies.
