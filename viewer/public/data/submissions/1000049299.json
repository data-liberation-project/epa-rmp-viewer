Crowne Cold Storage LLC. has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. \r\n\r\nThe PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a significant release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\r\nState regulations require reporting when there is an significant release of ammonia or a threat of signifcant release of ammonia.  \r\n\r\nCrowne Cold Storage, LLC. interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation or local first aid to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.
