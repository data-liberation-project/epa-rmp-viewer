Responders will investigate the release and report to General, Safety and Maintenance Management the location, extent of possible impact, level of risk and recommended actions.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to seasonal startup. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases.

This stationary ammonia system is operated continuously but operations vary dependent on product handled and growing season.\n\nThe facility is located in a Rural Area of Tulare County. The total ammonia inventory in the closed loop ammonia refrigeration system exceeds the Federal and State thresholds and therefore falls under RMP and PSM (CalARP) requirements.\n\nThe refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems.

The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Crowne Cold Storage, LLC. is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of the Crowne Cold Storage LLC. Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).

(Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\nSecond, all Crowne Cold Storage, LLC. employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees.
