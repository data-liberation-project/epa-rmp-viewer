If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP Coordinator at 336-878-4266.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effect would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\u00b7 When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would not experience any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n\u00b7 When considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast.  Windows at the distance could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.  People could be seriously injured by being knocked down by the force of the blast, by flying glass, or by falling objects.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and to ensure safe operation of our facility.
