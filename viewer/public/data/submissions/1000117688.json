A large quantity of chlorine, a highly hazardous chemical, is maintained at the facility and is used for disinfection as a part of the water treatment process. The amount of chlorine stored at the GWTP requires the City of Galax to implement and maintain a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Clean Air Act Section 112r(7) published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n       The City of Galax maintains a RMP to reduce or eliminate the public and environmental consequences of an accidental hazardous chemical release from the GWTP. This RMP plan includes hazard assessment, a formalized management system, and an accident prevention program. The City of Galax also complies with the requirements of the Process Safety of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 that requires a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that includes wastewater treatment process hazards analysis, employee training, contractor control, safety procedures and safety reviews for the GWTF.\n       The City of Galax is working with a consulting engineer to revise the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to be in compliance with 40 CFR 68.90 for a non-responding stationary source. The ERP will establish employee procedures for dealing with an accidental chemical release. These procedures will include coordination with local emergency responders, public notification and notification to the appropriate state and federal agencies. The ERP will also provide for training and periodic safety reviews to ensure that the chances of an accidental release are minimized.\n       Independent and internal audits of the RMP, PSM and ERP plans are performed periodically to make certain that the programs are updated and working as intended to reduce or eliminate an accidental chemical release from the GWTP.\n       T"
