      "SummaryText": "San Marcos Water Treatment Plant\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe San Marcos Water Treatment Plant (SMWTP) is a surface water treatment facility owned by the City of San Marcos and operated by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA).  The plant is located in Caldwell County, Texas at 91 Old Bastrop Road (Hays County Road 266), approximately one (1) mile north of Texas Highway 80 and one tenth (0.1) mile east of Texas Highway 21.  Gas chlorine is the only hazardous chemical on site with a maximum quantity of 12,000 pounds or six (6) one ton containers.  Only two containers are set-up for use at any given time, with only one container actually having chlorine drawn from it for disinfection of the water.  The gas is drawn off the container under a vacuum.  If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a valve located on the chlorine container automatically closes, stopping flow of the chorine gas and thus reducing the chance of a chlorine release.\n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine involves a release of 200 pounds per minute for 10 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  Radius of impact within the 2.1-mile urban setting could include a population of 2,300 persons, four educational facilities, four parks or recreational facilities, two correctional facilities, one major office complex and fifteen commercial buildings.  No hospitals, major industrial buildings, or federally designated environmental receptors are located in the impacted area.\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios were modeled.  Alternative A involves a break on the 1/2\" flexible line connecting the chlorine container to the header pipe.  Given a release rate of 18.5 lbs./min for 46 minutes, 853 pounds of chlorine could be released impacting a radius of 1.6 miles.  Within this area are a population of 2,100 persons, one educational facility, two parks or recreational facilities, two correctional facilities, fifteen commercial buildings, and one major office building.\n\nAlternative relea"

      "SummaryText": "se scenario B involves a damaged header pipe, a broken valve, or an open relief valve.  Radius of impact is 1.2 miles with 473 pounds released during the course of 9 minutes.  A population of 2,000 persons could be located in the impact zone.  Also, one educational facility, two park or recreational facilities, and one correctional facility are located in the area.  The probability of either alternative scenario is very low since both involve breaks or leaks between the source of vacuum and the vacuum actuated valve that automatically closes upon loss of vacuum.  Any break sufficient to release chlorine gas would stop the vacuum. \n\nGBRA has recognized the need for care in the handling chlorine. Chlorine handling has been addressed in the GBRA Safety Manual, the job safety analysis, the emergency operations plan, the preventive maintenance program, and the annual safety audit. Training has been conducted annually with advanced training occurring every two years. Training is conducted on practice containers purchased only to perform that function. Leak detection systems are located at the plant that activates an alarm at the point of a leak.\n\nOperations personnel either have completed or will complete a Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service Hazardous Release Technician course along with in-house training in use of SCBA and chlorine handling.  There have been no releases of chlorine in the operating history of the SMWTP, but in the event an incident does occur, the San Marcos Fire Department will be notified and will serve as primary responder, with GBRA personnel assisting as needed.  This site has been offered to the SMFD for future training and drills."
