The Emergency Response Program.\r\nThe facility has:\r\nA.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,29 CFR 1910.38.\r\nB.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III(EPCRA)\r\nC.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\r\n\r\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.

If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information\r\nThe primary activity at the anhydrous ammonia plant is the storage of and loading into nurse tanks of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distrubuted for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\r\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 571,526 pounds in our storage and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of  a tank turck holding 40, 000 pounds.\r\n \r\n3. The worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n    A.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \r\n         released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,795 pounds which represents the\r\n         volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 3.3 \r\n         miles.\r\n    B.  The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard revies is a 2 minute release from a ruptured\r\n          transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint is .40 miles.\r\n\r\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has emplemented the provisions of ANSI K61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. OSHA, 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and h"
