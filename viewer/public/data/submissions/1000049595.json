The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release preventation program.\n\n\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\n\n     Ammonia, Kk-611.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the\n\n     U.S. Occupatinal Safety and Health Admisistration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and handling of\n\n     Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.
