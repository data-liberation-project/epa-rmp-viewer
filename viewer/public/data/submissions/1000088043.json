These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to upsets in the system.\n\n\n\nThe Factory Engineer is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB - Stationary source and regulated substances Handled\n\n\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream Company Bakersfield Plant produces ice-cream products for sale to the public. The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration system to freeze ice-cream products and also to operate the plant air-conditioning.
