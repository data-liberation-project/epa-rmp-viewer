As part of this summary, a general overview of Omnium's Emergency Response Plan (the Plan) follows.\r\nThe plan consists of 12 sections: table of contents, several lists of relevant telephone numbers, specific guidelines and procedures regarding fire, human rescue, spill or release, sever weather, evacuation, flood, and off-site assistance.  There are also separate sections covering emergency first aid, training requirements, facility maps, and management procedures.\r\nAll emergency response team members receive training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  There are also specific training requirements for the primary and alternative emergency coordinators.  Refresher training is provided for all ER team members on an annual basis.+\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\r\nHand safety initiative for maintenance employees.  An evaluation of typical tasks performed by maintenance employees is being done by hired experts of personal protective equipment.  The hope for result will be the use of hand protection apparel that will protect our employees from most hazards.\r\nIndustrial hygiene specialists have been hired to evaluate risks associated with chemical handling.  The desired outcome will be recommendations for improvements to reduce or eliminate hazards and to provide protections from hazards associated with chemical handling.  \r\nIn addition, we are considering an enhanced program for job hazard analysis program that should also result in reduced hazards and more effective hazard avoidance and protection."

This is a flammable substance and is listed in Table 3 of Section 68.130 List of Substances.  This liquid is stored in a pressure vessel designed for this purpose and also maintained under a nitrogen gas blanket for suppression of flammable vapors.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Dimethylamine is stored and utilized in a process.  This is a flammable substance listed in Table 3 as well.  This liquid is stored in a pressure vessel designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure without taking into account active mitigation controls.  The release distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to the public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a AA\u00bfpublic danger zone.AA\u00bf  Possible causes of the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\r\nOmnium's hypothetical worst-case scenario regarding a toxic substance involves a 115,558 pound Aqua Ammonia release from a Storage vessel.  The worst-case assumes, as required by RMP, that the entire contents of the vessel are released"

Winfield Solutions, LLC owned and governed by Land O'Lakes, Inc. \r\n\r\nThe St.Joseph Omnium facility is located on approximately 56 acres in the southern industrial area of St.Joseph, MO.  Nearly 20 acres are developed with the remaining area leased to a local farmer for the purpose of growing crops.  The facility formulates and packages crop protection products used to grow crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases, especially hazardous materials.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this plant, the safety of its employees and safety of the community.\r\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, Omnium is committed the following:\r\nA knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\r\nA well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\r\nImprovements that enhance safety and accident prevention\r\nExcellence in safety programs and practices, and an outstanding safety and accident record\r\nPreparation and training for emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Policy\r\nOmnium has a written Emergency Response Plan, as required by RMP and other EPA and OSHA rules, and is committed to respond to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the LEPC and emergency response agencies.  Omnium personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the facility.  In addition, employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and poss"

This worst-case scenario has off-site impacts.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release: however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the facility's hypothetical alternative release scenario for Aqua Ammonia (a toxic substance), a flange leak for a duration of one hour results in a 1 inch puddle of Aqua Ammonia solution covering 40 square feet of the floor of the secondary containment area around the storage vessel.  This alternative release scenario has no off-site impacts.\r\n\r\nOmnium's hypothetical worst-case scenario regarding a flammable substance involves a release and instantaneous ignition of 31,000 gallons (245,145 pounds) of Dimethylamine.  This worst-case scenario has off-site consequences up to .5 miles from the point of origin.\r\n\r\nIn the facility's hypothetical alternative release scenario for Isopropylamine (a flammable substance), a flange leak for a duration of one hour results in a 345 pounds of material escaping.  The threat zone is measure at 13 yards from the source for this scenario.  There is no resulting off-site impact.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOmnium is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Elements of the PSM rule are included in the Program 3 Prevention Program under EPAAA\u00bfs RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, or process hazardous chemicals.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of facility operations.\r\n\r\nOmnium adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA"

      "SummaryText": "Prevention Program requirements.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in the programs throughout its years of operation.\r\n\r\nDue to the variety of substances Omnium handles in the normal course of doing business, several separate spill prevention programs and operating procedures are in place as an effort to reduce the risk or consequence of an accidental release.  A section in the plant's Emergency Response Manual is devoted to general chemical spill prevention while a separate program is in effect for preventing spills of petroleum products.\r\n\r\nSafety showers and eye washes are readily available\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe RMP rule requires inclusion of the facility's five-year accident history for all accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant proper or environmental damage on or off site.\r\nWe have had one accidental release of dimethylamine in the past five years.  Less than 1 pound, under pressure, was released and resulted in one employee injury.  There were no offsite consequences.  This incident was not used for an alternative case scenario due to the injury cause being occupational safety deviation rather than process safety failure and due to the lack of  potential for off-site consequences from this particular event.\r\nIn addition, an accidental release of less than 1 pound of Methyl Mercaptan for several seconds resulted in on employee injury.  Methyl Mercaptan has now been evacuated from the facility and is no longer being stored or utilized at the facility in any fashion.  Therefore, release of this chemical is not considered for Worst-case or Alternative-case scenarios. In addition, this particular exposure event would not be included since the injury was not due to a release and resulted from an employee inhalation of vapors within a confined space with no potential for release to an off-site end point.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nOmnium's emergency respon"
