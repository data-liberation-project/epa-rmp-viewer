We recognize that activities at this facility may impact our employees and the surrounding community. Because of this, Castellini is dedicated to environmental protection, employee health and safety, regulatory compliance and pollution prevention through a strategy of continual improvement and teamwork.\r\n\r\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this facility, our employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. Castellini is committed to complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. These programs enable the facility to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nIt is Castellini's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.

The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38. The programs consist of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires and/or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive periodic training in these procedures to perform emergency response duties. The program receives periodic reviews and is updated as necessary for modifications made to the facility or practices.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The facility offers the local fire department and other emergency response organizations the opportunity to participate in periodic emergency response drills. \r\n\r\nFacility personnel notify local agencies when emergency response assistance is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the facility plans to implement additional engineering safeguards. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the process."
