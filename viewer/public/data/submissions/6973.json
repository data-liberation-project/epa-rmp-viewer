We utilize Ethylene Oxide and Trimethylamine to produce a liquid, nonhazardous product called Choline Chloride.\n\nAs a member of CMA, Bioproducts is committed to providing a safe work place for our employees and being an environmentally responsible member of the community.The key to this is preventing releases.We will accomplish this by hiring and training highly skilled employees, utilizing state of the art process control systems and, above all, prioritize our actions based on the potential impacts to our employees and surrounding residents. In addition to the process control system and specially designed  equipment and safety systems, we utilize air monitors to alert us to any leak that may occur, enabling us to apply water deluge systems to mitigate the leaks and take other necessary actions.\n\nDuring our 20 months of operation we have had no RMP chemical releases. The worst case toxic scenario for our facility is the release of 273,915 pounds of Ethylene oxide in 10 minutes from our storage. With the use of administrative controls to limit the quantity in the storage, along with the installation of a berm, the distance potentially affected is 8.7 miles. The worst case flammable scenario is the release and ignition of 284,687 pounds of Trimethylamine from our storage tank in 10 minutes. The use of administrative controls to limit the quantity in the storage, results in a distance potentially affected of .5 miles.
