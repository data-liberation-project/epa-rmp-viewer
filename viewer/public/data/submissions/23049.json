Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Clarence Cooperative Co.(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and      propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 1,094,000 pounds of ammonia (this includes 3 rail cars)and 81,800 pounds of propane. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia-  The maximum quantity released would be 160,000LBs, which represents the volume of the largest  RAIL CAR-storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.10 miles.  \n\n        Propane- The maximum quantity released would be 81,800 pounds.  The distance         to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.40 miles.\n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia- The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pou"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia?.

The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.
