Schlegel Systems, Inc. and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific account-abilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the last 5 years:\r\n\r\n*  We have not had any significant releases of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) during the last 5 years\r\n\r\nIf an incident were to occur, we would conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Town of Henrietta Fire Department.\r\n\r\nWe have an in-house emergency response team consisting of approximately 43 employees who have received specific training on how to respond to chemical spills.  This training has included scenarios on releases of Toluene Diisocyanate in a variety of conditions.  We have 11 complete Scott Air Pack SCBA units, and numerous spare air cylinders, as well as a completely stocked and mobile spill response cart.  Team members meet quarterly to review hazardous materials issues, and train with the Scott Air Packs yearly.  In the event of a spill, Schlegel Systems, Inc. has contracts with outside environmental firms to assist in clean up if required.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the f"
