The El Centro - WTP has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorination system.  The El Centro - WTP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\n\n\nThe El Centro - WTP is located at 1101 Danenberg Dr., El Centro, California 92243. The regulated substance at the facility is chlorine.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 20,000 pounds (Lbs.) and it is stored in pressurized one-ton chlorine containers at ambient temperature in liquid form.  The regulated substance, chlorine, is used at the facility for water treatment purposes. \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nPer CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Chlorination System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014 CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 Five Year Update Binder. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014  CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 Five Year Update Binder.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the El Centro - WTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-c"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine release, including the following:\n\n?    Automatic / manual shutdown\n\n?    Shut-off valves connected to each one-ton container\n\n?    If a leak is detected by chlorine sensors, the detection system, connected to a control system, will be activated and it will shut the chlorine supply.\n\n?    The facility has chlorine detectors that activate a scrubber system.\n\n?    Safety showers/eye wash stations are available for operators, if exposed to chlorine.\n\n?    Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n\n?    The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the El Centro - WTP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n \n\nMaximum Intended Inventory\n\nNote: A 1-ton container of chlorine will contain at a maximum 2,000 pounds.\n\nOn Line    Two (2) - 1-ton Containers = 4,000 pounds\n\nStan By    Two (2)- 1-ton Containers = 4,000 pounds\n\nStorage (cradles)    Six (6) 1-ton Containers  = 12,000 pounds\n\nMaximum Intended Inventory    20,000 (10 Containers)\n\n\n\nAs illustrated above, the covered process has more than the 2,500-lb threshold quantity f"
