      "SummaryText": "FACILITY NAME\nPrewitt Escalante Generating Station (Escalante Station)\n\nFACILITY POLICIES & PROGRAMS\nEscalante Station is a 250 MW coal-fired steam electric generating unit located near Prewitt, New Mexico.  Escalante Station is owned and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. (Tri-State).  As a Tri-State facility, Escalante Station operates under the direction of the Tri-State Board of Directors.  The Tri-State Board of Directors have developed environmental health and safety policies requiring compliance with all applicable regulations.  These policies have been implemented for the protection of the employees, the public, and the environment.  To further the goals of the environmentl board policy, Tri-State management has also implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS), which is used to help set and achieve environmental goals, as well as to ensure environmental compliance.  \n\nIn addition to the compliance policies of the board of directors and the EMS, Escalante Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prepare for and provide a coordinated response to emergency situations.  The integrated approach is used to coordinate all aspects of emergency planning and response to provide for a comprehensive response to emergency situations.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is incorporated into the ICP to insure that the Risk Management Plan requirements are taken into consideration in the facility emergency planning and response efforts.  Additional information on the ICP can be found in the Emergency Response Program section below. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe primary function of the Escalante Station is to generate electric power for use throughout the region. Steam electric power generation involves the burning of a fuel source to heat water and produce steam.  The steam produced is used to spin a large turbine, which in turn rotates a generator that converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into ele"

In addition to producing power for regional consumption, the station also produces excess steam that is used at the nearby McKinley Paper Company paper mill.  \n\nWater is used at Escalante Station as an integral part of the power production process.  The majority of the water used by the station is for cooling with a portion being treated to produce potable water and process water.  Raw water for the plant is pumped from groundwater wells in the vicinity of the plant to an on-site raw water pond.   The water then undergoes treatment to make it suitable for the required processes.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at Escalante Station in amounts greater than the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds, 1,500 pounds and 2,500 pounds respectively.  Chlorine is used at the station to disinfect the water and prevent biological growth within water systems.  The use of chlorine in the water treatment (potable and process water) system ensures that the water is disinfected and safe for human consumption in addition to providing the above benefits.\n\nThe water treatment system operates under a vacuum, which draws chlorine directly from the cylinder regulators into the process.  A vacuum type system is used to minimize the need for pressurized lines.  The elimination of pressurized lines minimizes the potential for a large release and helps ensure the safety of the employees and the surrounding community.  For additional safety, only one cylinder is valved into each process at any one time to prevent the possibility of a release from multiple containers.  \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nThe water treatment chlorine process requires a level three prevention program due to applicability of the OSHA PSM standard.  Due to the similarity of the RMP and PSM rules, an integrated approa"

Each of the prevention program elements listed above is included as an integral part of the RMP/PSM program and the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). This approach ensures that the chlorine system requirements are considered during emergency planning and response activities at the station.  Portions of the PSM/RMP prevention program are also integrated into the facility work management system to insure that PSM/RMP activities and considerations are addressed during routine maintenance activities at the station.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nEscalante Station is committed to ensuring the safety of its workers, the safety of the surrounding community, and the protection of the environment.  To this end, Escalante Station maintains relationships and/or written agreements with the local fire departments, hazardous materials emergency response (hazmat) team, and local emergency planning committees.  In addition, Escalante Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to meet all OSHA and EPA emergency response requirements.  The ICP assists in the evaluation of risks and in the preparation for and response to all types of emergencies.  The ICP sets forth procedures for emergency response and notification requirements for the public and government agencies.  The ICP also details the emergency response organization, the training requirements, and the required maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents at the Esca"

Recently the decision has been made to switch to a system that utilizes bleach for the replacement of the chlorine system.  A managment of change has been initiated for this change with the replacement scheduled tentatively for late 2009 or 2010."
