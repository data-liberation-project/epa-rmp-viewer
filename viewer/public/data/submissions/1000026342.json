ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response activities with the Scott County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Georgetown/Scott County Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Brenntag's primary activities encompass chemical warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are three (3) regulated substances present at this facility that exceed or could possibly exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130.  Those subtances are chlorine, sulfur dioxide and ammonium hydroxide. These regulated subtances are received prepackaged in 2000 pound tons containers, 150 pound cylinders, 330 gal poly IBC totes and 55 gal poly drums .  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonium Hydroxide is only used for resell to our customers.  \n\n\n\n3.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 for Program Level 2.  While the two RMP regulated substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) are listed under OSHA's Process Safety Management Appendix A as set forth under 29 CFR 1910.119, this facility does not have any PSM covered processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention p"

Process Safety Information:  Brenntag maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\n\n\nb).  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's):  This facility conducts comprehensive PHA's to ensure that hazards associated with each regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The What If Techniques are methodologies utilized for completion PHA's.  The PHA's are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  PHA's are reviewed prior to the implementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an accidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release.  At a minimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nc).  Operating Procedures:  For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.  Operating procedures are regularly evaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\n\n\n\nd).  Training:  Brenntag has a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees are competent in the operating and safety procedures associated with the each regulated process. New employees receive basic training in process operations and safety procedures, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided whenever there has been a change in the process or at a minimum once every 3 ye"

Maintenance:  Brenntag conducts inspections and maintenance on container handling and delivery equipment such as fork-lifts and tractor trailers to ensure on-going equipment integrity.  Daily inspections are conducted by Brenntag personnel with periodic maintenance conducted by qualified 3rd party service facilities.  All equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Tractor trailers and drivers are subject to frequent inspection on the highways by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration.\n\n\n\nf).  Compliance Audits:  Brenntag conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions, as set forth under the RMP regulation, are being adhered to at this facility.  These audits are conducted at least every three years as required per this regulation.  Corrective action, resulting from the audit, will be implemented in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\ng).  Incident Investigation:  Brenntag will investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the mitigating circumstances surrounding the incident, as well as, to identify any corrective actions that need implemented to prevent such incident from reoccurring.  All incident investigations are retained for a minimum of five years as required per this regulation.\n\n\n\nh).  Employee Participation:  Brenntag truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation efforts to this standard.  \n\n\n\ni).

Brenntag has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards that is related to the contractors work area within the facility.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response and facility evacuation in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History:  Brenntag has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies and employee training, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan:  Brenntag has developed a written emergency response plan to address the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including spill response and cleanup, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  This plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes that have taken place within our facility.  Our emergency response plan has been coordinated and verified with the Scott County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety:  At this time, no changes are required at this facility."
