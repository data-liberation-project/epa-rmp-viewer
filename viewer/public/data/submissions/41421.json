It was previously revised to address additional data elements required to be included in all RMPs by June 21, 2004 per USEPA rule changes.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Chicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. - Bedford Park are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as hazardous materials segregation procedures, material handling equipment maintenance, and employee training associated with storage of hazardous materials at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility:  peracetic acid.\n\nWe have varying inventories for this chemicals.  For this reason we are filing this RMP report under the predictive filing concept.  Peracetic acid is a component of customer-packaged materials stored in our warehouse.  Maximum quantity stored is approximately 71,100 pounds, packaged in 230-gallon totes.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMPComp.  The worst case scenario will be a liquid spill and vaporization of the biggest container present in our warehouse.  We are considering the building as passive mitigation for the calculation of the toxic endpoint.  The alternative scenario will be a similar release, with varying atmospheric conditions.     For the calculations of the toxic endpoint we considered the same passive mitigation and a sprinkler system as active mitigation components available.  Our results fr"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program Level 3 and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards (MSDS) for the regulated substance.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our warehousing process were identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis was Industry Checklist, as recommended by CMA's Warehouse Assessment Protocol.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Chicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as segregation and storage procedures, use of forklifts, loading and unloading, examination of damaged containers, labeling of containers, and bracing, stacking and handling damaged containers.\n\nTraining\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on an yearly basis and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nChicagoland-Quad Cities Express, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on forklift"
