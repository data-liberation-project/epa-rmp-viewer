Description of the Albuquerque, NM. Facility\r\nThe Albuquerque, NM. facility is located at 6139 B Edith Blvd.N.E. The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Albuquerque, NM. Warehouse include chemicals containing toxic hazards. Hydrochloric Acid 37% solution and Ammonium > 20% solution are the only RMP regulated substance handled at the site.\r\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\r\nRinchem receives Hydrochloric Acid 37% & Ammonium >20% solution by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system. After an order is received, Rinchem ships the above listed chemical as ordered by the end user.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Rinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensures the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards taken include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of Hydrochloric Acid 37% or Ammonium >20% solution.\r\n1.4. The Five Year Accident History\r\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Hydrochloric Acid 37% or Ammonium >20% solution at the Rinchem Company Inc, Albuquerque, NM. warehouse.\r\n1.5. The Emergency Response Program\r\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Albuquerque, NM.  warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Hydrochloric Acid 37% or Ammonium >20% solution from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above-mentioned material. Rinchem has developed an emergency action program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of chemicals to employees. Rinchem management has opted to contract emergency response for releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. The Albuquerque warehouse emergency action program consists of: Emergency Action Plan and Environmental Safety Health Reporting Procedure, Emergency Evacuation Plan The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.
