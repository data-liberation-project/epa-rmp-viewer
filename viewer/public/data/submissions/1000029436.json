BCSS is owned and operated by Duke Energy.\r\n\r\nPLANT AND PROCESS INFORMATION\r\n\r\nBCSS operates an anhydrous ammonia system as a component supporting selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of the plant's boiler emissions.  Ammonia vapor (in the presence of the SCR catalyst) reduces NOx compounds to nitrogen and water to reduce the total NOx effluent emitted from the plant.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is comprised of six storage tanks - 3 for each plant boiler unit.  Each tank has a water capacity of 60,000 gallons, along with feed pumps and vaporizing equipment.  Each of the six tanks will is administratively controlled such that their individual capacity will not exceed 48,000 gallons, for an aggregate site capacity of 289,000 gallons.  This total quantity of ammonia exceeds threshold quantities which invoke the requirements of the Risk Management regulations.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nBCSS has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by regulations, including an extremely unlikely worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release of one of the tanks assuming worst case meteorological conditions).  Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors could be affected.  \r\n\r\nA release represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the design of the system components and the prevention program that is in place.\r\n\r\nEPA chemical release reporting databases, EPA guidance documents, and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulation is so unlikely that it should not be used as a basis for emergency planning purposes.  A more realistic potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented below.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nA credible alternative release was formulated in"

      "SummaryText": "accordance with EPA guidance.  This scenario involves the failure of the transfer hose while offloading ammonia from a semi-tractor trailer delivery vehicle.  It is important to note that, while BCSS has not actively prepared for responding to a release of this severity, it is still very unlikely to occur due to numerous design, operational, and emergency response safeguard features that are in place.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES\r\n\r\nBCSS is committed to public safety, employee safety, continued reliable operation, and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  A management system has been developed with clearly defined accountability and responsibility for the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that any serious chemical releases do not occur, BCSS maintains a release prevention program which is focused on protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving ammonia.  This multifaceted program includes the use of:\r\nAmmonia gas detection and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n\r\nProcess instrumentation and interlocks which will shutdown the system and isolate ammonia supplies to the plant if process conditions (such as flow, temperature, and pressure) are not within their appropriate safe operating ranges;\r\n\r\nProcess safety information which documents the safe design of the process system;\r\n\r\nProcess hazards analysis to evaluate the chemical and process hazards and make recommendations for safety improvements;\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures to ensure the system is operated safely;\r\n\r\nMaintenance, inspection, and testing of system components to ensure that they are safe for continued use;\r\n\r\nSafe work practices to ensure that employees working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely, and know the actions to"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had any major chemical release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\r\nA minor incident did occur in 2011 where an unloading hose displayed signed of leakage. The operators, following procedures, stopped the unloading process and removed the hose from service.  It was determined that the leak lasted around 30 seconds and less than 8 ounces of ammonia seeped through the hose's layers. No environmental impact or employee exposure occurred.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\n\r\nIn the event that an ammonia release does occur, BCSS has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the appropriate off-site agencies including the Emergency Planning agencies of Stokes, Rockingham, Forsyth, and Guilford Counties, as well as the Belews Creek Fire Department.  BCSS maintains an emergency response team on-site (24/7) with the appropriate number of members, training, and equipment to actively respond to and take action necessary to secure credible releases of ammonia that might occur.  Additionally, there are a number of emergency operations procedures in place which detail the appropriate emergency actions that would help mitigate the effects of releases.\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING A SAFE OPERATION\r\n\r\nDuke Energy's Belews Creek"

Periodically, BCSS will audit the program, review the Process Hazard Analysis, coordinate emergency response organizations, and will update the program as needed to assure safe and efficient control and management of the anhydrous ammonia system."
