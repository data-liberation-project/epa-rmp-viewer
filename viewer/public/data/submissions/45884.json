The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated and the employees of the Marion County MFA Agri Service near Hannibal are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Palmyra Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.  The facility also handles pesticides, as well as feed and farm supply products. \n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  The facility has thirty-three 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 2 applicator tanks, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 288,106 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuat"
