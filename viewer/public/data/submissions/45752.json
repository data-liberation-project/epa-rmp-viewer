      "SummaryText": "\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nIn reviewing the potentially covered processes at Del Monte Goodyear Facility, the only RMP-covered process is the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\n\nDel Monte uses the ammonia refrigeration system to chill and hold produce products.\nThe ammonia system utilized by Del Monte includes a liquid ammonia receiver. High-pressure liquid ammonia flows from the high-pressure receiver to the pump receiver(s) and then to the evaporators where the pressure is reduced by allowing the ammonia to expand through expansion valves. The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia liquid ammonia is evaporated to provide refrigeration. Ammonia vapor exiting the evaporators is returned to the engine room where it passes through the pump receiver(s) or accumulator. In the pump receiver(s) or accumulator, any liquid that may be entrained in the vapor is separated. The resultant dry vapor is drawn to the compressors where it is compressed. The compressed vapor is then condensed to its liquid form in the evaporative condensers and returned to the high-pressure receiver.\n\nThis RMP Submittal is offered to address the following regulatory requirement:\n\n?    EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119\n\nAppendix A contains a copy of the Federal RMP Data Sheet Electronic Submittal:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following paragraphs are reproduced from Del Monte Goodyear Facility US EPA RMP Submittal Executive Summary for the convenience of the reader.\n\nDel Monte Goodyear, California facility is located at 14550 La Estrella, Goodyear, AZ 85338. The facility maintains approximately 60 to 90 full time employees, depending on the season. The facility cools and stores produce products for regional distribution to retail stores. The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop \"Direct\" type system.\n\nThe Del Monte Goodyear, California facility has developed a risk management program to address EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119) and to enhance an already exist"

Del Monte is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Del Monte staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nDel Monte Goodyear, AZ facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Their policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia systems are composed of the following key components:\n \n?    1 Condensers\n?    1 Low Pressure Receiver\n?    2 Ammonia Pumps\n?    1 Pilot Receiver\n?    1 Oil Pot\n?    4 Compressors \n?    14 Evaporators\n?    1 Diffusion System\n\nSystem operation cycle begins at the pilot receiver where liquid ammonia is fed from the receiver to the Low Pressure Receiver.  At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then pumped to the evaporators where it absorbs heat from the room. Vapor is returned to the pump receiver from the evaporators where the gas is separated from the liquid. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the pilot receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the RMP regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of "

      "SummaryText": "the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (given that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is comprised of interconnected equipment) we used the Low Pressure Receiver releasing 6570 pounds in 10.0 minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, most portions of the Ammonia Refrigeration System are located inside, however no credit was taken for containment.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the RMP regulations.  ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm.  The results show that off-site areas will be affected. This WCS is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor as a result of an ammonia relief valve relieving for 10 minutes at 100 lbs/min.  For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is 1000 pounds.\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm.   The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-cre"

      "SummaryText": "dible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n- Floor drains in the Engine Room would provide containment for liquid release and therefore minimize the potential for offsite impact.\n- Although most of the ammonia is located in the Engine Room. Conservatively, no credit for enclosure mitigation was taken.\n- Plant personnel, as necessary, use personal Protective Equipment (PPE).\n- The history of the Facility reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIEC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this EPA Program, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by Del Monte to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for refrigeration.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The EPA/PSM Prevention Program elements include:\n\n- Hazard Review \n- Operating Procedures\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Incident Investigation\n- Compliance Audits \n- Employee Participation\n- Contractors\n- Mechanical Integrity \n- Hot Work\n- Management of Change\n- Trade Secrets\n- Training   \n- Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nFIVE-"
