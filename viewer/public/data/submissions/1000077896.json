The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Grain Company of Hillsdale, Oklahoma, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\nA? The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nA? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nA? The maximum quantity stored would be 183,855 pounds in our 12,000 gallon and 30,000 gallon storage tanks. Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 183,855 pounds figure was listed as 180,000 in the RMP Submit.\n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:\n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\nA? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nA? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb. Provided state "
