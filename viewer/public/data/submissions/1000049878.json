LSCP is designed to produce approximately 150,000,000 gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year. Wet and dried distillers grains (WDGS/ DDGS), as well as corn oil, are byproducts of ethanol production and are sold to local markets as animal feed. Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code 2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.\n\n\n\nLSCP is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by LSCP's investment in accident prevention, through the establishment of a facility that is well designed, installed, operated and maintained. In addition, training is considered a crucial part of safe operation and accident presentation. Staff is trained about spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response plans in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nIt is LSCP policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. LSCP management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and proper emergency response.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe LSCP ethanol plant is located at 4808 F Avenue near Marcus, Iowa.  This location is approximately 2.5 miles east of Marcus, Iowa.  The site is generally located in Section 2, Township 92 North, and Range 42 West of Cherokee County, Iowa.  The LSCP property is a long, triangular stretch of land that encompasses approximately 40 acres.  The site is bounded by 480th Street to the north, F Avenue to the east, and by an unnamed creek to the south.  A facility road provides access to 480th Street.  The Canadian National (CN) Railroad borders the site to the south and west wit"

      "SummaryText": "h a spur on the site's southeast side providing rail access to the LSCP plant.  \n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The substance which LSCP has onsite that is regulated by the RMP program is Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to denature the ethanol so that it is unfit for human consumption before being shipped offsite. Denaturant is generally stored onsite in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.  \n\n\n\nPrior to August 31, 2010, LSCP had an ammonia system on site, which would have also been regulated by RMP.  However, this system has been removed and LSCP has no plans to reinstall it.  In the event the system is re-installed, the RMP will be updated accordingly. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for the flammable substance at LSCP is a vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of 447,522 pounds (71,500 gallons) of the flammable mixture from the Denaturant Tank, creating a vapor cloud fire with a 0.6 mile radius. In this scenario, the tank is filled to capacity and the administrative controls to limit the maximum fill to 90%, or 99,000 gallons, have failed. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at LSCP is a vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of 402,770 pounds (64,350 gallons) of the flammable mixture from the Denaturant Tank, creating a vapor cloud fire with a 0.6 mile radius. This scenario takes into account the administrative controls limiting the maximum amount of denaturant in the tank to 99,000 gallons. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nLSCP has been subject to RMP criteria since it began storing anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline) onsite.\n\nIn the last five years, LSCP has had no reportable accidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPSONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nLSCP is included in the Marcus, Iowa Communi"

In the case that an incident occurred which required high level emergency response, LSCP would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support. \n\nAs explained above, LSCP is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel will respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, all tanks that contain denaturant are located in a large, bermed containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would be prevented from migrating off-site, and a fire could be extinguished before it spreads to other units at the facility.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nLSCP is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3.  LSCP is fulfilling its duties to comply with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.115(d) through the completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  LSCP has complied with Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  \n\n\n\nThe denaturant tank is equipped with tank level sensors and alarms and has a bermed containment structure that surrounds the entire tank farm.  These chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to as"

LSCP management is committed to promoting a safe work environment and will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support to operate the ethanol production facility in a safe and efficient manner.
