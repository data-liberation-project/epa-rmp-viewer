Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (EGTS) operates the facility that is owned by Eastern Gathering and Processing, Inc. (EGP).\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nEGTS is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is EGTS's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, employees control and mitigate the effects of the release. Washington County emergency response (911) will be utilized for emergency response capability. EGTS has also contracted EnviroServe to provide additional emergency response expertise. Furthermore, EGTS utilizes a SharePoint website that contains the OSHA Process Safety Management program elements associated for all hazard assessment, accident prevention, and emergency response for each facility. \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nEGTS stores and handles one chemical, propane, which is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The process includes six 90,000-gallon propane storage tanks that receive propane from an underground pipeline. These tanks are administratively limited to 89% of full capacity.  A pump is used to transfer the propane to the facility's two truck transport loading stations. The maximum inventory of propane at the facility is approximately 2 million pounds. No other flammable"

This facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at this facility. \n\nProcess Safety Information - EGTS maintains a detailed record of current process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The What If method was used to perform these evaluations. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years. All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, EGTS maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Initial employee training is provided and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented and a record of training is maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures. Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper operation and maintenance. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedur"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes (if any) and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the facility. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits are conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly implemented. The audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process at a frequency not less than once every three years. Audit findings are documented in a report and corrective actions are addressed promptly. \n\nIncident Investigation - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be promptly investigated. An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable of the process involved. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action.\n\nEmployee Participation - EGTS believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.
