      "SummaryText": "East Penn Manufacturing Company, Inc. is a producer of lead storage batteries with main manufacturing facilities located at Lyon Station, Pennsylvania.  East Penn provides jobs for over 7000 employees.  In conjunction with lead storage battery manufacture at the Lyon Station, PA site, East Penn owns and operates a secondary lead smelter for the purpose of reclaiming lead and other materials from spent batteries.  East Penn recycles nearly 100% of materials from used, spent lead-acid batteries.  The smelter utilizes an ammonia scrubber to remove Sulfur Dioxide from the process gas streams of both the reverbatory and blast furnaces and maintains onsite a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank and piped delivery system to the scrubber headers.   The ammonia scrubber and ammonia tank and piping was designed and built according to generally accepted good engineering practices in accordance with the requirements of the ASME code for pressure vessels and 29 CFR 1910.111 - Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nAs stated in our written EHS policy, East Penn is committed to complying with all applicable government regulations and producing batteries in a way that does not jeopardize the health and safety of employees, community and the environment.  This includes taking reasonable precautions and establishing systems to ensure that a release of anhydrous ammonia at hazardous concentrations does not occur.   \n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Release Prevention Program has been established and implemented according to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119 and consists of the following elements:  1.  Visual and  documented  inspection of tank, valves, gauges and piping by Smelter management.  2.  Visual inspection of tank and components by anhydrous ammonia supplier.  3.  Triannual compliance audit of process safety management plan and update of process hazard analysis .  4.  Initial training and refresher training for all maintenance and plant personnel "

      "SummaryText": "who operate or perform maintenance on the ammonia scrubber system.  Ammonia awareness training is also conducted for all employees who work in the building and immediate vicinity of the ammonia scrubber and components.  5.  All incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a release to the environment are reported to the Environmental, Health & Safety Department for investigation.  The investigation team consists of the EHS Department, Smelter Management, and affected employees.  6.  Rules for contractors, maintenance activities and hot work permits exist.                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEast Penn's Hazardous Materials Team is trained to the Operations Level.  Arrangements have also been made with the local (Berks County) Hazardous Materials Response Team to respond to leaks if conditions dictate or the release has the potential to have offsite consequences.  Members of East Penn's Hazardous Materials Team have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED SAFETY CHANGES"
