The plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Ventura County Fire Department and Ventura County Environmental Health Division) and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Emergency Response requirements.  The Cogeneration Facility has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGENERAL FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE INFORMATION\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility, operating since 1988, is located at 1947 W. Potrero Drive, the City of Camarillo, in Ventura County.  Ammonia is used for the reduction of nitric oxide from the steam generator exhaust.  Ammonia is stored in a bulk storage tank, which is designed to hold 10,936 gallons of ammonia.  However, operating procedures (administrative control) specify that maximum quantity of ammonia in the tank should be 85% of the tank design capacity.  This ammonia storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP RMP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nAmmonia is brought to the Cogeneration Facility and transferred to the bulk ammonia storage tank.  The tank is equipped with an electrically heated vaporizer to maintain adequate vaporization and constant pressure in the storage tank during ammonia withdrawal. Vaporized ammonia is withdrawn from the tank and diluted with ambient air prior to injection into the plant's Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) zone.  The ammonia system contains the following instrumentation and controls to ensure safe operation of the system:\n\nStorage Tank Fill and Outlet Lines: Excess flow check valves (EFCV) are installed in the storage tank nozzles for the vapor return line, inlet and outlet lines of the vaporizer, drain line, and vapor supply line.  The EFCV closes the line in the event of a break to minimize the escape of ammonia to the atmosphere."

      "SummaryText": "Leak Detectors: Two ammonia detectors are installed near the storage tank.  These alarms will activate at ammonia concentration of 200 ppm.  A signal is sent to a local audible alarm and remotely to the DCS located in the Control Room.\n\nStorage Tank: The tank is equipped with high pressure and high high-pressure alarms.  A water deluge system is available to cool the tank and reduce the pressure.  In addition, the tank is provided with a dual pressure relief valve to protect the tank integrity during overpresurization.\n\nAmmonia Vaporizer: High pressure or high temperature will shut down the vaporizer heater.  The vaporizer is also provided with a pressure relief valve.\n\nAmmonia Dilution System: To prevent ammonia concentrations in the dilution air stream from reaching explosive limits, power or blower failure will cause a flow control valve to close; thus stopping the ammonia flow from the storage tank.\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility is also provided with an emergency generator, which will be operational in 5 to 10 minutes on loss of main source of power.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nPlease refer to Off-Site Consequence data located onsite at OLS Energy Camarillo.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe Cogeneration Facility is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.
