Both PRVs vent to the roof.  Weather conditions and wind impacts caused elevated ammonia levels inside and outside the brewery.  An evacuation was initiated.  All employees, contractors and visitors were accounted for.  Two employees sustained recordable injuries due to eye irritation.  The total release of ammonia was calculated to be 18,000lbs.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Ft. Collins brewery has in place a variety of emergency response procedures in the event of an incident involving ammonia. The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120(q)). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain an Environmental Incident Plan (EIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Poudre Fire Authority. We conduct annual drills to help us remain prepared to implement the EIP at the brewery, and periodically invite local agencies to participate.\r\n\r\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAnheuser-Busch's Ft. Collins brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety. All ammonia refrigeration pressure relief valves are recertified on a five year staggered schedule. Recertification consists of relief valve removal, testing, rebuilding if necessary, and reinstallation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its safe"

Collins, Colorado, recognizes and shares the community's interest in safe operation of our facility. We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program requirements to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.\r\n\r\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process. Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations. The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely. \r\n\r\nOur corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.
