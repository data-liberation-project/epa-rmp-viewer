      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Woonsocket Water Division (WWD) of the Woonsocket Department of Public Works is a Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission regulated public utility registered with the Department of Health as Public Water System number 1559518.  WWD serves a population of 42,000 and local industry.   WWD operates a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to our service area. Average demand is about 3.5 million gallons per day (mgd).  The service area includes the entire City of Woonsocket, Rhode Island as well as parts of the towns of North Smithfield, Rhode Island; Cumberland, Rhode Island; Blackstone, Massachusetts; and Bellingham, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances and Associated Hazards\n\n\n\nThis risk management program document has been prepared to meet the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program regulations as stated in 40 CFR Part 68 (A?RMP regulationsA?).\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only chemical in use by WWD in sufficient amounts to be covered by the Risk Management Program regulations.  Chlorine is a heavier than air gas that may be fatal if inhaled.  In lesser quantities it causes respiratory distress and may burn skin and eyes.  The substance is highly reactive and will readily mix with other substances causing further hazards.  In the presence of moisture, chlorine becomes highly corrosive.  A concentration of 30 parts per million causes coughing, 40 to 60 parts per million is dangerous within thirty minutes of exposure, and at one thousand parts per million is apt to be fatal in a few breaths.\n\n\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Woonsocket Water Division (WWD) is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  The WWD intends to continuously identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer techn"

WWD safety and environmental programs include training and licensing for all treatment plant operators and active relationships with the Woonsocket Fire Department hazardous materials team and the local LEPC.  WWD maintains an emergency response plan that covers toxic releases as well as water supply concerns.  WWD management takes a hands on role in day to day operations and monitors compliance with safety procedures. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nWWD is committed to preventing accidental releases of chlorine gas. The primary elements of our program are as follows:\n\n1) STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES:  WWD reviews and revises its procedures for safe handling of chlorine gas cylinders and associated equipment. These procedures are based on recommended industry practice and adapted to be specific to our facility.\n\n2) PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE: WWD maintains and implements an aggressive Preventive Maintenance Program.This program consists of monthly equipment inspection for signs of corrosion and equipment wear and failure. During these monthly inspections Alarm, detection and automated shutdown systems are tested to ensure they are functional. In addition once per year an inspection and annual service is performed by external experts in the maintenance and repair of chlorine systems.\n\n3)EMPLOYEE TRAINING: WWD recognizes that the most important part of any accident prevention program is the facility's employees. All WWD employees including supervisor and managers are Certified Water Treatment Operators licensed by the State of Rhode Island for operation of water  facilities. These licenses have continuing education requirements in order to be kept current. In addition WWD has an internal  training program specific to its standard operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures.\n\n4) EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT: WWD replaces critical system components as technology changes and  prior to the  end of their lifecycle.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCID"

      "SummaryText": "ENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe WWD has developed an emergency response program (ERP) to minimize the effects of various emergency situations on employees, the public, and the environment.  The manual includes a list of telephone numbers of agencies and individuals to contact in the event of one of several pre-identified situations (e.g., fire, dam failure, storage tank failure, or chlorine release).  The agencies and individuals represent local emergency responders (e.g., fire department), public notification and regulatory reporting requirements (e.g., DEM, DOH, LEPC1), and internal notification (e.g., Public Works / Administration). \n\n\n\nWWD has integrated its plan with the Woonsocket Fire Department hazardous materials personnel to ensure that an appropriate response can be made in the improbable event of a major release. In addition WWD has dection equipment that is alarmed directly to the Woonsocket Fire Department that notifies them immediately of any release.\n\n\n\nWWD is equipped with four air packs, detection alarms, a chlorine cylinder repair kit, and emergency suction venting to ensure that in the case of an equipment failure, employees, the public, and the water system can be protected.  Class III licensed drinking water operators employed by WWD are trained to initiate emergency response to chlorine releases.  There is at least one such person on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES to IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSince the submission of WWD's original Risk Management Plan, WWD has replaced  vital chlorinator components, replaced our detection system and alarmed it directly to the fire department We have also installed automatic shut off devices to our  system. In addition we have installed internal and perimeter security systems to protect against sabotage and outside access to our facilities.\n\n\n\nIn the future WWD plans to implement more improvements to our security system. The City of Woonsocket has completed a concep"

This may allow WWD to discontinue the use of Chlorine gas. Also under consideration is the possibility of relocating the treatment facility to a more remote location. This would considerably lessen the risk to nearby residential areas. WWD also includes written profiency testing as a part of its employee training  program.\n\n\n\nQuantity released (lbs): section 3.5 Alternative Release.
