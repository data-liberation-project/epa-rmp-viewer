      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\n\nFisher Scientific is the world leader in serving science. Fisher began its operations in Somerville in early 1970.  Today, the Somerville Site receives, repackages, and distributes chemical products to research, healthcare, industrial, educational, and government facilities. Fisher is also a leading supplier of occupational health and safety products and maintenance, repair and operating materials.\n\nThe Somerville Site consists of two main buildings situated on 41 acres.  The site consists of offices, maintenance shops, quality control laboratories, repackaging systems, and warehouse storage areas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week, and employees 160 people.  \n\nNOTE ON RE-SUBMISSION\n\nThis RMP Registration is being re-submitted to reflect a change in Program Level for the Distrubution Center from a Program 2 to a Program 3, due to a change in applicability of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Fisher has taken this opportunity to review and update, where necessary, all aspects of the RMP registration, including inventory quantities and updated dates of the various RMP programs and procedures.\n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW\n\nThe Somerville Site has two primary functions: to receive and repackage chemical products, and; to distribute those products to its customers.  The receiving and repackaging area is known as the Bridgewater Packaging Facility.  The Repackaging Facility receives chemical product in various containers, ranging from 55-gallon drums to rail car quantities.  Product is repackaged into containers of various sizes, ranging from milliliter size to drum and tote containers.  \n\nRepackaged product is then stored in, and distributed from the National Distribution Center.  The Distribution Center consists of warehouse storage, including fire-rated concrete storage vaults, used for flammable material storage.  Product is shipped primarily by tractor-trailer.  \n\nThe Somerville Site handles hazardous materials as defined by b"

      "SummaryText": "oth the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).  The NJDEP and USEPA regulations are designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling hazardous materials.  Additionally, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) implements accident prevention regulations designed to protect employees.\n\nThe Somerville Site handles eight materials that are regulated substances under the NJDEP and USEPA regulations.  Note that inventory quantities reported in Section 1.17 for hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia represent the total weight of the solution (i.e., weight of solute and dilutant).\n\nFor this USEPA re-submission, ammonium hydroxide (CAS # 1336-21-6) is registered as ammonia (conc. 20% or greater, CAS # 7664-41-7), since the correct CAS # (1336-21-6) is not on the USEPA list of covered materials.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nFisher Scientific has established a number or safety and environmental programs designed to ensure safe operation of the Somerville Site.  Existing environmental policies address accident prevention, spill control and containment, and air and water pollution control.  Safety policies exist to ensure the safety of our employees and to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  \n\nThe Somerville Site's emergency response plan specifies plans to follow in the event of a plant emergency.  Our emergency response activities are coordinated with local response agencies to help ensure a coordinated response, and thereby maximize community safety.\n\nPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nNJDEP and USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what are defined as  worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  These analyses have been completed and the results reported in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Registration as appropriate.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "here have been no significant releases of any of the regulated materials in the last five years of plant operation.  A significant release would include a release resulting in some type of offsite impact including injuries, evacuations, or environmental damage, or onsite injuries or significant property damage.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nOur Site Operations Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  The Manager of Environmental, Health & Safety has responsibility for implementation of our risk management program (RMP).  Fisher has developed programs to comply with all required environmental, health, and safety standards.  \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs, including:\n\n- Process safety information\n- Pre-startup review\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Compliance audits\n- Operating procedures\n- Accident investigation\n- Training\n- Employee participation\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Hot work permit\n- Contractor safety\n- Management of change \n\nThese individual elements of our risk management program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn addition to our management programs, we have designed both passive and active mitigation systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases.  Passive mitigation includes those design features that are essentially \"fail-safe\".  In other words, they will successfully operate to control or contain a potential release, without the need for electrical power or worker intervention.  Passive mitigation includes our state-of-the-art spill control and containment system:  our rail car area, tank truck area, and storage tanks are protected with secondary containment to contain and divert potential spills to a co"

Our property is protected by firewater and sprinkler systems, inspected annually by an outside independent company.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nFisher has a fully developed emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  Our plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  Our plan has been shared with the Bridgewater Fire Department to help ensure a coordinated response.\n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting our local community, Fisher works closely with local, county, and state agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency.  For additional information on what actions to take in the event of an emergency, contact the Bridgewater Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFisher Scientific has created a culture that strives for continuous improvement of its environmental, health, and safety program. We train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  We also encourage our employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help improve safety and performance.  We perform preventive maintenance to minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment.  Our systems and programs are audited annually, typically by an outside company, to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\nWe have recently reviewed and modified our prevention program elements, including written operating procedures, mechanical integrity programs, management of change program, and our emergency response plan.  We have also recently upgraded site security measures."
