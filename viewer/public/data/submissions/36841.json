The Western Virginia Water Pollution Control Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a comprehensive approach    that incorporates technologies, work procedures, and administrative practices.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Virginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH) procedures have served as guidelines and standards in the development of this program and are adhered to.  The Plant emergency response policy involves the creation of an emergency response plan which incorporates response capabilities available both internally and from the community.\n\nB. The Water Pollution Control Plant was established in 1951 to disinfect and treat the wastewater of the City of Roanoke, the County of Roanoke, Salem, and the town of Vinton.  The Plant is located at 1402 Bennington Street in Roanoke, Virginia.  The covered process include a standard gaseous water disinfection system and anaerobic digestion of wastewater solids.  The facility is manned and operated twenty four hours per day by licensed wastewater treatment operators.  All process areas are continuously monitored through the use of control center monitoring as well as hourly walk throughs by employees.\n\nThe Roanoke Valley has created the Western Virginia Water Authority for purposes of managing the water and wastewater utilities in the Roanoke Valley. This transition initiated revisions to the facility plans as of May 2004 which are represented in this update.\n\nC. The Water Pollution Control Plant accidental release program is based on the following key elements:\nHigh Level of Operator Training, Preventative Maintenance Program, Use of state of the art process and safety equipment,      Performance of hazard analysis of equipment and procedures, Implementation of inspection programs.\n\nD. No reportable release of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or dig"
