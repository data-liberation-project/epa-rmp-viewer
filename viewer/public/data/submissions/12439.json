      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\n\nSt. Marks Powder, Inc., owns and operates a manufacturing facility near St. Marks, Florida.  St. Marks Powder, Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of Primex Technologies, Inc., and conducts business under the name \"Primex Technologies Ordnance and Tactical Systems Division\".  In this document, the facility will be referred to as \"PRIMEX\".\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at PRIMEX:\n\nPRIMEX's overall approach to chemical safety is to prevent incidents, and respond effectively if incidents occur.  It is PRIMEX policy to conduct safety reviews/investigations, which include accidental release prevention, whenever changes are made, incidents occur, or at least every five years.  It is PRIMEX policy to maintain an on site emergency response capability that includes fire and hazardous materials hazards mitigation.\n\n\nThe stationary source and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility manufactures smokeless propellant for ammunition.  One of the steps of the product production process uses nitric acid and oleum, which is also known as fuming sulfuric acid.  Both nitric acid and oleum are regulated substances under the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation.\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternate-case scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of a 12,000 gallon tank containing nitric acid and oleum.  A containment dike limits the extent of the liquid released and also limits the exposed surface area.  The release rate is reduced to 14.0 pounds per minute of nitric acid.  This scenario will have some limited offsite impact.\n\nThe alternate-case scenario is a transfer hose failure resulting in the release of 720 pounds of nitric acid and 680 pounds of oleum.  No offsite impact would occur.  Administrative controls and mitigation measures include a manual shutoff valve.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe general accidental release prevention progr"

PRIMEX's on site emergency responders are fire and hazmat trained.  Public notification is accomplished through the Wakulla County Sheriff's Office, Division of Emergency Management.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nAt this time, there are no planned changes involving RMP regulated chemicals.  Employees are continuously retrained to ensure maintenance of safety awareness."
