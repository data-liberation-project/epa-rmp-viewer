      "SummaryText": "The mission of Pilot Chemical is to manufacture chemicals in a safe, efficient and environmentally acceptable manner.  Pilot Chemical is committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9001:2000.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\n\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Lockland Plant occupies approximately 3 acres in an open, relatively flat, industrial area, north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1964.  The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through batch sulfonation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial and institutional markets.\n\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics.\n\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of 14F.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur Dioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm.  With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with a odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.  Sulfur Dioxide is stable and non-flammable in either the gaseous or liquid state.\n\nSulfur Trioxide is a clear, colorless, oily liquid at temperatures between its freezing and boiling points, which are 90F and 113F respectively.  Sulfur Trioxide has a strong irritating odor and is very hygroscopic, reacting violently with water.  Sulfur Trioxide fumes react with the moisture in the air to form a dense, white cloud of Sulfuric Acid mist.  This mist is extremely irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\n\nResidences are at least 600 feet from the"

In addition:\n\u00b7 Sensitive Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide vapor detection systems are installed with monitors located in strategic locations throughout the processing areas to alert plant personnel of leaks.\n\u00b7 The facility is subject to safety inspections by the Lockland Fire Department and our insurance company.\n\u00b7 Before beginning any maintenance operation involving hot work, a Hot Work permit must be completed and signed by both production and engineering.\n\u00b7 The computer controlled processes are Fail safe and include emergency shutdown capability that close isolation valves and stop chemical transfers to effectively limit the amount and extent of a release.  Instruments continuously monitor pressure, temperature and level in critical process vessels and automatically alarm if a parameter exceeds acceptable ranges.  Equipment interlocking is utilized to prevent operation under unsafe conditions.\n\u00b7 An extensive operator training program is in place that utilizes a combination of classroom training and demonstration of competency with evaluation by written test and observation.  Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal and process safety.\n\u00b7 All incidents are investigated, including very small drips and leaks, and actions are taken to prevent recurrence.\n\u00b7 An extensive mechanical integrity program is in place which includes equipment preventive maintenance schedules, vessel thickness testing, relief system inspections and instrumentation calibration.\n\u00b7 Pre-startup reviews are held prior to starting new or modified equipment per OSHA standards.\n\u00b7 Routine audits of operating procedures and work instructions are conducted to assure that safe practice"

A Sulfur Dioxide condenser unit failed releasing about 700 pounds of gasseous Sulfur Dioxide resulting in five offsite injuries.  \n\nBecause we believe that in the event of a chemical accident quick response is necessary to minimize the likelihood of onsite or offsite injuries, an extensive emergency response plan is in place.  In addition to the written plan:\n\u00b7 All employees receive annual training on the use of the emergency response and evacuation plans, use of personal protective equipment, operation of fire extinguishers and spill mitigation techniques.\n\u00b7 Currently, 7 plant personnel are trained at the 40 hour industrial emergency responder Technician level.  Each technician receives annual refresher training.\n\u00b7 The facility has a working relationship with the Lockland Fire Department.\n\u00b7 Emergency response drills are performed regularly.\n\u00b7 Emergency response equipment is on site.\n\u00b7 A plant wide emergency notification system is in place.\nAs a part of our commitment to continuous improvement planned changes to improve safety at the facility include:\n\u00b7 Updating the control system software to include advanced security features and more sophisticated process upset alarming.\n\u00b7 It is our intent that all mechanics and lead operators will receive industrial emergency responder Technician level training within the next two years."
