In the event of a significant release of propane that involve off site populations, these populations will be notified through the LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n-\tCompliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n-\tAn ongoing dialogue with the local Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develo"

These high standards include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n-\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe Leicester-WYE Siding Facility does not operate under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. However, they do operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since operations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Leicester-WYE Siding Facility within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nRay Terminals and the contract operator have documented emergency response plans and procedures in place at the Leicester property to respond to and safety mitigate any release or accident involving propane. Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by Ray  Terminals contract operators to control the release, if possible, and to make initial notification to local responders and to Ray Energy Corp.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for Ray Terminals operating at 2567 Leicester-Whiting Road, Leicester, Vermont, comply with NFPA-58 requirements for propane storage, and it is the policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is Ray Terminals policy to notify the Brandon Fire Department (802-247-3400 or 911) and local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and request that they respond to the emergency. This plan has been prepared to meet the requirements of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68); the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR Part 1910.119; the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard (HAZWOPER), 29 CFR 1910.132; Personal Protective Equipment General Requirements, 29 CFR 1910.133; Personal Protective Equipment Eye and face protection, 29 CFR 1910.134; Personal Protective Equipment Respiratory protection, 29 CFR 1910.138; Personal Protective Equipment Hand protection, 29 CFR 1910.120; the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Leicester-WYE Siding facility is leased/operated by Ray Energy Corp.. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids.
