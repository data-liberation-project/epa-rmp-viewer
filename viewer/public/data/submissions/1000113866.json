      "SummaryText": "pportunities for improved process safety were identified.\n\nSunoco's RMP/PSM program includes a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP includes procedures for notification, response procedures, evacuation, and follow-up in the event of an accidental release of the hazardous chemicals and light gasoline blend fuel. Sunoco is an active member of the Huntington Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), including participation in table-top and full-scale emergency response exercises. \n\nThere is no history of reportable accidental releases associated with hydrogen or LGB at the Facility.  \n\nSunoco is committed to continuous improvement, including identification of additional prevention and detection measures as needed.  In 2021 Sunoco implemented several Inherently Safer Technology (IST) initiatives to significantly reduce potential hazards associated with facility operations, namely material substitution and inventory minimization.  Sunoco has eliminated the use of sulfur dioxide (a highly hazardous chemical) by substituting ammonium bisulfite (ABS), a significantly less hazardous (and non-RMP regulated) chemical in the Hydrotreating Process.  Additionally, the facility significantly reduced the on-site inventory of anhydrous ammonia to quantities below the RMP and PSM threshold quantity of 10,000-lbs.  This reduction in on-site inventory improves the inherent safety of the process.  These IST initiatives demonstrate Sunoco's commitment to process safety.\n\nThe May 2024 RMP Registration Resubmission is to update the facility name, ownership, and supply the most recent dates related to the facility's Prevention Program for both chemical processes."

Sunoco's RMP/PSM program includes: \n   -  Process hazard analysis reviews\n   -  Written operating procedures\n   -  Operator training\n   -  Mechanical integrity (i.e., preventive maintenance) \n\nThe program includes a compilation of documentation that describes the hazards of the flammables handled, process technology, the design of process equipment, and safety systems employed. Development of these prevention programs included participation of facility employees (including operators and maintenance personnel) knowledgeable in plant operations. The RMP/PSM program includes procedures for managing change as well as pre-startup review. Safe work practices include, but are not limited to, hot work, lock-out/tag-out, confined space entry, line/vessel opening, and others. These programs are targeted to enhance safety and accident prevention. \n\nSunoco's management team, along with all of its employees, is committed to providing a workplace free of accidents. For example, during the early stages of the Hydrotreater Process design, the facility conducted a comprehensive hazard and operability (HAZOP) study geared to identifying potential hazards related to the hydrotreating process and use of hydrogen. The HAZOP included evaluation of engineering and administrative controls to prevent, detect, or mitigate hazards. The HAZOP identified recommendations for improved process safety that were incorporated into the final design. A second HAZOP was then conducted to review the status of previous recommendations and included identification of additional risk reduction measures. In June 2021 the facility completed a PHA Revalidation Review of the Hydrotreater process.  The HAZOP study teams included Sunoco plant personnel, engineering process design personnel, and technology providers.\n\nAdditionally, a HAZOP review of the LGB process was conducted in June 2019.

      "SummaryText": "Sunoco LLC owns a petroleum processing facility in Huntington, IN (the Facility). Unlike large crude oil refining facilities, Sunoco processes a petroleum product known as 'transmix.' Transmix is a mixture of finished products that occur when fuels are transported in pipelines. The mixture is typically a combination of gasoline, diesel, and/or jet fuel, but as a mixture, do not meet approved specifications for fuels. Operations at the Facility produce saleable gasoline and diesel. \n\nIn order to meet Federal US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) mandates for ultra-low sulfur fuel, Sunoco has invested in a significant expansion at its Huntington facility. Sunoco has employed state-of-the-art technology after separating transmix into gasoline and diesel fuel to meet mandated ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel requirements. This technology, called hydrotreating, and subsequent processing (i.e., Hydrotreating Process), requires the use of hydrogen, a chemical regulated under USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program.  \n\nOperations at the Facility also include the storage and handling of a light-gas blend (LGB).  This LGB is a flammable mixture and is also included in this registration as a second process (i.e., LGB Storage & Handling Process).  This process includes pipeline transfers and storage in atmospheric storage tanks and in pressure vessels.\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program requires regulated facilities to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP). Likewise, the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires facilities handling these chemicals and flammable mixtures to develop a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. RMP/PSM is targeted to ensure programs and procedures are in place to prevent accidental releases that could injure workers or impact the community. \n\nSunoco's use of the RMP/PSM regulated materials includes product receipt, bulk storage, and transfer to processing equipment. Sunoco has developed a RMP"
