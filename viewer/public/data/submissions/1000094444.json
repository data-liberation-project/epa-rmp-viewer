This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Sanderson Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant which extracts hydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.  The raw natural gas streams are delivered via pipeline to the plant from the local gathering system.  After extraction of the hydrocarbon liquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as products.  Products are transported from the plant via pipeline and truck.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nSeveral storage vessels within the plant process were evaluated for the worst case release scenario.  Results of the worst case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 1 requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 393,295 pounds of a flammable mixture from one (1) Stabilized NGL Storage Tank.  The entire inventory of this vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and potentia"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures shall be annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures will be kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nThe operating procedures are used to communicate safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) pipe break procedures for hazard mitigation before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Outrigger Energy has developed a comprehensive training program for the employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, the operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are"
