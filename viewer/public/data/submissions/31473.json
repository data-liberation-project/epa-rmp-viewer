The senior management at ESCO Company supports this commitment through our company Safety and Health policy.  This policy includes the following statements:\n \n\"ESCO's primary business objective is to operate without incident.  The Management commitment exhibited at ESCO sets the tone for ESCO's safety attitude.\"\n\n\"It is the policy of ESCO to provide for the continuous development, implementation, and maintenance of an ongoing program which assures safe and healthful working conditions, including the development of, and adherence to, safe work practices.\"\n\nAt ESCO, protecting people and the environment is a part of everything we do and every decision we make.  Each employee has responsibility in ensuring that our products and operations meet applicable government or ESCO standards, whichever is more stringent.\n\nOur goal is to eliminate all injuries, prevent adverse environmental and health impacts, reduce wastes and emissions, and promote resource conservation.\n\nESCO Company is a small chemical facility located in Muskegon, Michigan that produces color formers.  ESCO operates in partnership with Mitsui Chemical Company and Yamamoto Chemical, Inc. in Japan.  ESCO is the nation's leader in the manufacture of color formers.  Color formers produce the image on carbonless paper forms.  The image is formed when pressure is applied to the paper.  Our product has allowed the elimination of carbon paper, which previously was needed to produce multi-copy documents.  Color formers are also used for heat sensitive applications, such as labels and fax paper; our products are used worldwide.  ESCO employs approximately 80 people.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management chemicals used in the process are bromine and methyl chloride.  The bromine is stored in a 3,000 gallon glass-lined tank.  Administrative controls keep the maximum inventory of bromine to below 2,213 gallons.  The bromine tank is inside of a "

This tank is located outside in a tank farm.  Administrative controls keep the maximum inventory of methyl chloride to below 5,927 gallons.\n\nESCO Company is required to comply with the O.S.H.A. Process Safety Management standard.  Both the processes that use methyl chloride and bromine have been extensively reviewed for safety through the Process Hazard Analysis.  We work through a What-If/Checklist procedure in the Process Hazard Analysis meeting where team members bring up \"what if\" questions that we answer based on our safety systems and procedures.  This procedure helps to make sure that we are operating a safe system and that there are safeguards in place to protect employees and the environment.  ESCO has incorporated the requirements of Process Safety Management into the batch records to provide clear and safe batch instructions.  Each operator is trained in the operation of the equipment and the safety systems before they are allowed to operate the equipment.  ESCO employs a preventive maintenance system that helps make sure that equipment gets inspected and tested as necessary to ensure its integrity to handle the chemicals of the process.  Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors who work at our facility are trained and are made aware of the safety procedures required at this facility.  Any changes made to the process are carefully reviewed and documented to make sure that any safety concerns are addressed.\n\nThe EPA requires that a five-year accident history be developed describing any releases of listed chemicals which resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage, off-site deaths or injuries, off-site evacuations or shelter-in-place procedures, or environmental damage.  In the past five years from 1999 to 2004, ESCO has had no accidental releases of methyl chloride or bromine.\n\nESCO"

      "SummaryText": " has used the EPA Risk Management release scenarios to improve our emergency response plan and to develop a stronger relationship with the fire department.  We have trained our supervisors to understand the potential scenarios of releases of bromine and methyl chloride.  We also have included the fire department battalion chiefs in this training, so that our supervisors and the battalion chiefs are familiar with each other and the actions each of them would take in an emergency.\n\nESCO is committed to the principles of continuous improvement in the safety of our processes and in reducing risk to the community.  We plan to conduct emergency drills that may include a mock release of methyl chloride or bromine to practice the emergency response procedures that have been planned.  We will review how the drill goes and improve the emergency response plan or our emergency response training as necessary.  The process hazard analysis team and the safety committee play key roles in identifying areas of improvement in the safety of our processes.  These groups will continue to meet to reassess safety equipment and procedures for improvement.\n\nIf you have any questions, or would like more information, please contact Bruce Katje, the Regulatory Compliance Manager, at 231-727-6459."
