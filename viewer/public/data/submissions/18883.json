The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Indian Springs Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as: (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) start-up following a turnaround or emergency shut down.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n \n In addition, the  plant maintains a Cause and Effect Diagram that provides information on how each of the process equipment will react to  upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive initial training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator works with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests,"

These tests are conducted as part of the mechanical integrity element of Teco's PSM program, which the plant has had in place for the past several years. Ultrasonic testing is also performed on non-insulated piping and vessels in the plant to determine that thickness of the piping and vessels meets service requirements.    \n \n An alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from a 1 minute release of ethane from a seal/packing failure at the product pumps. Such a  release is expected to be isolated by a automatic shutdown valve within one minute (active mitigation).  The valve would receive a signal to close from a gas detection system which monitors the pump area. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is .05 mile or 239 feet. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n \n The gas detection system, the automatic shutdown valve and other safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15-month intervals.

Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program and how the 14 elements of the PSM standard are being addressed is included in the PSM Policy and Implementation Plan which is maintained at the  plant.  In addition, the gas plant has  initiatives underway that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include individual safety awards presented for safety excellence during the previous year.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Indian Springs Gas Plant has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant management is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is always readily available to the employees.\n \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n Contractors\n \n The gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Teco's  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel and emergency personnel (when appropriate) will respond to control and contain the release to ensure the safety of the public and our employees.\n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant, located 16.2 miles east of Livingston on Highway 190 in Polk County, Texas operates processes to extract liquid petroleum products from the natural gas stream. This liquid product consist of ethane, propane, butane,  which are regulated flammable substances.   In order that we establish as  safe of environment as possible for our employees and the public, Teco has elected to maintain  minimum inventories (well below the threshold quantity) of toxic subtances.\n \n The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the surge tank containing 105,000lbs. of ethane.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is .40 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive and/or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n \n The surge tank was built and installed to ASME Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII Standards.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n Release Detection\n \n1.   Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2.    Low pressure alarms and shutdowns.\n\n\nRelease Containment\n                                                                                                                                    \n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature, high pressure).\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump).\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices to protect pressure vessels.\n \nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n \n2. Trained emergency response personnel.\n\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There has been a decreasing trend in the frequency of accidental releases. None of the accidental releases that have occurred in the past 5 years resulted in offsite effects.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  \n   \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE P"

      "SummaryText": "ROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Indian Springs Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and a post incident review.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Indian Springs gas plant is coordinated with the Polk County, Texas Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. The plant provides annual refr"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  This information is communicated to other company employees in other plants by way of the PSM News Brief.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \n Compliance Audits\n \n To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Indian Springs Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n \n CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \n The processes at the Indian Springs Gas Plant must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and safety procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and safety procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n \n Management of Change (MOC)\n \n The Indian Springs Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to; (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  All operators and/or effected employees must review, understand and sign the MOC (Form 703) prior to starting his/her shift. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \n Incident Investigation\n \n Incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion,  gas release, major property damage, enviro"
