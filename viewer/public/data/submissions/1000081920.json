The corresponding NAICS code is 424910, Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only chemical at this facility subject to EPA's Risk Management Program. \r\n\r\nThe fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, is received and stored for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year, product transfer does not occur.  The maximum quantity handled at any given time would be when the product is off-loaded from a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe owner/operator of the facility is committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia during transport or when stored at the facility.  The facility does not have employees that are trained to respond to releases, but in the event an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Lincoln-Lancaster County Emergency Management, and/or other authorities, to minimize and mitigate the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA Program 2 Prevention Program, which incorporates all of the required elements, has been developed for the facility:\r\n - Safety information is compiled, maintained on-site, and updated as necessary.\r\n - A hazard review has been conducted using a checklist methodology and documented.\r\n - Written operating procedures have been developed for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. The procedures specify steps for each operating phase. Procedures are updated, as reviewed.\r\n - Training materials related to the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia, have been reviewed.\r\n - The facility has written procedures for maintaining the process equipment and has identified necessary ch"

The facility does not have employees that are trained as first responders. In the event of a significant release, site personnel will dial 911, so that the appropriate fire and rescue, police, ambulance, and emergency management services can be dispatched, as warranted by the situation.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility. Recently, a new bulkhead was installed on the main tank and additional vehicle barriers were placed around the main tank. Hazards related to the handling and storage of ammonia will continue to be evaluated in an effort to continue to improve safety."
