      "SummaryText": "Accidental Toxic Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n       At the CIty of Franklin Water Treatment Plant, chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process for the city's drinking water supply.  The addition of chlorine is a vital step in ensuring a safe and dependable water source for our customers.  As valuable as chlorine is, it must also be handled with care.  Safety is our number one priority for our water supply and the proper handling of the chemicals we use for our treatment.  Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  With this in mind, safety measures are taken involving the handling and usage of chlorine adhering to all federal and state laws that apply.  Our concerns are met with the safety training of personnel, the safety design of the facility and the safety devices that are in place throughout the areas of interest.  Also, an Emergency Response Plan has been created that includes procedures to be followed in the actual event of an accidental toxic release in conjunction with disaster and emergency response services.             \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n     The regulated substance at this facility is chlorine.  As noted above, the purpose of this facility is to treat drinking water and to provide a water supply for the City of Franklin's customers.  Access to any and all areas of this facility are restricted to authorized employees and authorized contractors.  Chlorine is delivered to the plant via truck transport in chlorine approved cylinders.  The loading and unloading of these cylinders are performed with safety equipment that is located at the chlorine storage area.  The chlorine storage area is enclosed and is restricted to any unnecessary entry by lock and key except by approved authorized personnel.  The maximum amount of chlorine that is stored on site is 9000 pounds.     \n\nWorst Case Realease Scenario\n\n     In a worst case release scenario, chlorine gas would be release"

This scenario is based upon the release of all chlorine in one cylinder.  The distance for the endpoint of the worst case scenario is 0.9 miles.  It is the opinion of the Franklin Water Treatment Plant that through our administrative controls and mitigation measures, the worst case scenario would be less severe than stated above.    \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n     The City of Franklin is proud to announce that there have been no accidents at this site.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n     The emergency response plan for the Franklin Water Treatment Plant is based on the COmmonwealth of Kentucky's DIvision of Emergency Management's Tab Q-7.  This plan is incorporated into the county's emergency response plan for SImpson County by the LEPC.  A representative from the local DES visited the Franklin Water Treatment Plant inJune of 1999.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\n     The City of Franklin Water Treatment Plant is constantly striving to improve its services.  Therefore, safety is always a main concern.  With the advent of stricter laws and regualtions, the facility personnel are continually being trained and updated on new techniques, procedures and materials.   Safety meetings are conducted once a month.  Chlorine procedures and safety protocols are reviewed every 6 months."
