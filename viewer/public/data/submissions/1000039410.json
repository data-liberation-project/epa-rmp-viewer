      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Regional CSD (District), has instituted a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP), as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with any Regulated Substance (RS) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities. The program describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees.  The program also describes offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis, defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of RS accidental releases, and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for auditing of program elements and implementation of mitigation measures.  The previous RMP 5 year update was filed in March 2009 as required by ARP regulations.  Administrative corrections were filed in August 2010 and August 2011 following a change in management positions and document program element updates, reflectively. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe SRWTP treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, from the Cities of Folsom, West Sacramento (Yolo County), Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, and Citrus Heights.  It is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd. The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas. There are approximately 340 full-time employees at this site and daily contractor and part time employees. The Plant treats 140 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) on average. Chlorine is used for disinfection, sulfur dioxide for de-chlorination and the Plant maintains quantities of the"

Additionally, methane gas is held in the digester gas system in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity. \r\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems consist of railcar receiving, liquid chemical withdrawal from railcars, liquid chemical vaporization, and gaseous chemical metering and dissolving into water for ultimate application at various points in the wastewater treatment process. \r\nSolids removed in the wastewater treatment process are introduced into the  anaerobic digesters at the Plant. Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is produced in the digesters through anaerobic digestion. The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, stored in low pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used to generate electricity and steam.  Digester gas that cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is flared or optionally used as a fuel source for on site boilers. Most methane is consumed shortly after it is collected; however, the entire potential stored inventory of digester gas in the plant must be considered for the purpose of comparison with the Federal threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\nIt is the policy of the SRWTP that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  To accomplish this goal, the SRWTP has safety information on chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane, the processes, and RS equipment and procedures; performed  and revalidated a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed and revalidated an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a writ"

A Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) is used as a management tool for the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS \r\nMany steps to prevent releases of an RS have been identified and implemented since the original RMP submittal.  These include, but are not limited to, validation and correction of chemical handling system vent and pressure reliefs, automation of external plant emergency trip isolation valves for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, structural assessment and repair of critical methane gas equipment, increased security, and creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures and training. \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or methane at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe SRWTP's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane have been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  Furthermore, the emergency response programs were revised in 2012-13 in close coordination with Cosumnes Fire and Sacramento City Fire Hazmat Departments. The SRWTP maintains and is"

Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities by the SRWTP or outside Agencies, are thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation by SRWTP staff. Planned changes that will improve safety include projects such as elimination of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide by converting from gaseous to liquid forms of these chemicals which will eliminate two  (2) covered processes,  and complete structural assessments and repairs for the methane digester process."
