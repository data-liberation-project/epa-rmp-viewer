The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by\n\nthe Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling\n\nof anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the\n\npast five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any\n\naccidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.
