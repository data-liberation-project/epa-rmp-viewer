The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Akron Services, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any\n\naccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of\n\nall persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire dept and the\n\nlocal emergency planning committee so that they can plan for any response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to\n\npeople and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received,\n\nstored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. Product may also be loaded into semi trailers for sale and\n\ndistribution to other local dealers.\n\n\n\n3. Worst case/alternative-case scenarios are developed at this facility but are withheld from the executive summary as security sensitive information. The worst case scenario includes the risk that a storage tank, the largest single vessel, would be released over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by\n\nthe Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling\n\nof anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the\n\npast five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any\n\naccidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written em"
