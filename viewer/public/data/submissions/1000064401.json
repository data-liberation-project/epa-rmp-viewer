      "SummaryText": "This facility handles propane which is listed as a regulated flammable substance by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which propane is handled combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures and training of personnel.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon Iowa Army Ammunition Plant generated Haz Mat protocol, Emergency Response Plan, APP 2000, that was updated in 2016 and the NFPA 58 Iowa Code.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of potentially affected neighbors.  American Ordnance also conducts 8 hour hazwoper refresher training each year.\n\n\n\nThis propane storage tank is used as a backup fuel for three Natural Gas Boilers that were installed in 2017.  The propane storage tank is 5000 ft from the property line of the facility."
