The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling this chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community and or environment. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia to chill glycol which is distributed throughout the facility as a refrigerant liquid. The ammonia liquid is fully contained within process piping and equipment in a closed loop system. Release scenarios were discussed as part of the Process Hazard Analysis and a Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario were selected for Risk Management Planning.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario: The scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the largest vessel and complete release of 46,895 lbs of Ammonia. Assumption parameters such as release duration (10 minutes), wind speed (1.5 m/s), atmospheric conditions (Stability F), temperature (25 ?C, 77 ?F) were specified by the RMP Comp The release rate of 2,580 lbs/minute was programmed into the RMP Comp Software that was used to model the Toxic Endpoint. A release inside an enclosed space was factored into the scenario calculation and reduced the release rate. The RMP Comp scenario calculator determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 2.9 miles. The toxic endpoint and potential off site receptors are identified on the attached map.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: The scenario is based on a rooftop piping leak releasing 3,000 lbs of ammonia in a period of 30 minutes. The RMP Comp scenario calculator showed that the incident resulted in effecting a 0.2 mile area to its toxic endpoint. Assumpt"

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Michael Foods Norwalk is required to and has implemented a Facility Emergency Response Plan. If an emergency was to occur, we have trained personnel and equipment ready for response in the event of a spill of hazardous materials. It is also our policy to notify the Norwalk Iowa Fire Department (via the 911 system) and the Warren County Emergency Response in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and will comply with all applicable state codes and regulations. Michael Foods Norwalk takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes. Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered processes are all considered. By conducting thorough evaluations, accidental releases are prevented and the consequences of releases are minimized.\n\n\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the RMP standards, Michael Foods Norwalk intends to prevent releases of hazardous substances and minimize the impacts of accidental releases, especially into locations that could expose employees, the community or the environment to serious hazards. Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n\n\n-Maintaining Process Safety Information (PSI): Michael Foods Norwalk maintains up-to date technical information about safe operating limits of the processes and associated hazards of the chemicals involved.\n"
