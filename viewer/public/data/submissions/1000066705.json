NOTE: Railcars were previously reported under the Adhesives (shutdown as of October 2014) process in 1999 and 2004 and were transferred to the South Butvar process in the 2009/2010 timeframe based on their proximity to the process equipment and the volume of Vinyl Acetate used by the department.  The VAM Bulk Storage Tank was also included with the Adhesives unit, but because it continues to be utilized by South Butvar, it has been apportioned to this covered unit.",

Indian Orchard Plant. This renewal updates the RMP to reflect the following changes:\n\n- Removal of the Adhesives process unit.  This process unit was physically shut down as of October 1, 2014 and no longer presents a worst-case toxics (vinyl acetate monomer [VAM]) release scenario nor will it be included in a Level 3 Prevention Program.\n\n- As a result of removal of the Adhesives unit, the Building 89 Warehouse no longer handles VAM-containing materials and as a result, is no longer covered under our RMP.\n\n- Update of the worst-case and alternative toxics release scenario to reflect operations in South Butvar.  The bulk VAM tank is now considered part of South Butvar for this analysis.\n\n- As corrected in June, within 30 days of his departure, John Weiss is no longer the Person Responsible for RMP implementation or the Emergency Contact.\n\n- Updates to all relevant process-related dates for safety inspections, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), etc.\n\n\n\nSolutia Inc.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs, process safety management systems, and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety and health of our employees, the public, and the environment. This Executive Summary provides an overview of the comprehensive risk management and process safety procedures and practices that we have designed and implemented at the Indian Orchard Plant and includes information on the following:\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the Risk Management Program rule.\n\n- An overview of our emergency response programs.\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the surrounding community, or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACILITY (STATIONARY SOURCE) DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Indian Orchard Plant was originally established by the Fiberloid Corporation in 1904 and purchased by Monsanto Company in 1938. In 1963, Monsanto acquired the Shawinigan Resins facility on the opposite side of Grochmal Avenue, creating the current site. The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982 and following a spin-off from Monsanto in 1997, Solutia Inc. was formed. The site includes manufacturing units producing high-value specialty products that include Saflex interlayer, and Butvar resin. The site also includes a Technology Center, complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities, finished product warehouse buildings, wastewater collection and neutralization facilities, a powerhouse, analytical laboratories, and office buildings.

Soca USA, leases a former warehouse building from Solutia to house a small recycling process they own and operate at the site as well. The Adhesives Department that was owned by Cytec Industries, Inc. (but operated and maintained by Solutia employees), was permanently shut down by October 1, 2014.  As a result, the processes related to the Adhesives department have been removed from this RMP.  The entire plant occupies approximately 250 acres and Solutia currently employs approximately 380 people from the greater Springfield area and the surrounding communities. Additional employees for Ineos Melamines, MassPower, Cytec Industries, and Soca USA also work at the site. \n\n\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nIn our current production processes, we use only one chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release; vinyl acetate monomer.\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped by our suppliers as a liquid in approved railcars. Three(3) railcars, on average, are typically present at the site at any given time; however, a maximum of 5 railcars may be stored at the site to support plant operations. These railcars are unloaded into an aboveground storage tank that has a capacity of approximately 200,000 gallons and is filled to 80% capacity or 160,000 gallons. This tank is located inside a concrete containment structure designed to hold the entire contents of the tank in the event of an accidental release. The plant's South Butvar Department utilizes vinyl acetate as a key raw material in the production of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resin. This resin is the primary ingredient in the manufacture of a plastic sheet (interlayer) that is \"sandwiched\" in laminated safety glass for automotive and architectural applications.

Released at rate of 4,510 pounds/min - 43 minutes.  Distance to endpoint is 6.2 miles.\n\n- Alternative:  South Butvar - Release of partial contents (70,000 pounds) of vinyl acetate into secondary containment from a 2\" hole in the side of the bulk Vinyl Acetate Monomer tank (200,000 gallon tank).  Released at rate of ~1,600 pounds per minute for a duration of ~45 minutes.  Distance to endpoint is 0.7 miles.\n\n\n\nMore information on these releases is available in the submitted RMP scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSolutia employs a systematic and proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals at the Indian Orchard Plant. Our process safety management and risk management systems include each of the key components of a successful prevention program including:\n\n- Development and maintenance of process safety information.\n\n- Completion and revalidation of process hazards analysis (PHA) studies.\n\n- Development, review, and use of written operating procedures.\n\n- Development and administration of employee training programs.\n\n- Mechanical integrity programs for the inspection, testing, preventive maintenance, and repair of plant equipment.\n\n- Management of change procedures to evaluate, approve, and communicate new or modified equipment, process conditions, raw materials, etc.\n\n- Execution of pre-startup safety reviews.\n\n- Completion "

Our plant is constantly upgrading its operations and safety systems to improve the level of protection to our employees, the community, and the environment we operate in.\n\n\n\nProgress continues to be made in the improvement of the process safety and risk management systems at the Indian Orchard Plant, and within Solutia as a whole, since the previous RMP resubmittal. Some examples of these improvements include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\nSite-Wide Emergency Drill: Solutia plans to conduct a site-wide emergency drill in early September 2015.  Planned scenarios include utilization of the onsite ERT to address a process-based emergency.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): At the Indian Orchard Plant, revalidation studies were conducted to evaluate the processes in the South Butvar Department in February 2015.\n\n\n\nLayers of Protection Analysis (LOPA): The Solutia LOPA technique will continue to be utilized during the revalidation of PHAs in the South Butvar Department.\n\n\n\nLockout / Tagout (LOTO) Program: The LOTO program at the Indian Orchard Plant was recently updated as part of an effort to continuously improve the program.  This program will continue to be reviewed and audited in order to ensure the proper control of hazardous energy, particularly in PSM and RMP affected units.\n\n"
