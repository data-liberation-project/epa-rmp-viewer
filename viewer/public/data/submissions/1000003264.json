With the exception of the Hydro Clear Sand Filter Process, the remaining processes use and store chlorine and sulfur dioxide that exceed the threshold specified in the Risk Management Plan rule. \n\n    Savanna Street and Trahon Big Creek WWTFA?s\n\nThe Savanna Street WWTF treats wastewater from Hinds, Madison, and Rankin \nCounties, which is chlorinated and dechlorinated in the gaseous form prior to discharge into the Pearl River. The site has 32,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time. The process has four (4) headers that are capable of feeding 8,000 pounds/header. The cylinders are on a standby/on-line basis to insure that the chlorination process is continuous. Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers.\n\nThe Trahon/Big Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater from the South Jackson and Byram areas. The facility discharges treated wastewater into Big Creek, thence to the Pearl River. The site has 4,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time. Sulfur Dioxide is stored in twelve (12) 150# cylinders. \nProcess Safety Information \nSavanna Street has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemical substances and equipment specification sheets for every single piece of equipment, each piece of equipment's upper and lower limits, approved operating procedures, training manuals and process description write-ups, maximum intended inventory, fire water drawin"

The PHA for the chlorination system discusses the hazards of the process, the engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazard as well as the consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls. This PHA was conducted May 18, 2009 and May 28, 2009.\nThere are provisions in its organizational infrastructure to accommodate a PHA Team which consist of an Area Manager, Safety Administrator, Two (2) Technicians, one (1) Lift Station Supervisor and a Chief Operator, who are responsible for conducting, updating and re-validating the analysis.\n\nIn addition to provisions for the PHA Team, there are written policies and procedures describing the team's purpose, goals and objectives, as well as how it functions. \n\nThere is documentation that shows not only has Savanna Street developed, but has actually implemented a PHA procedure that; promptly addresses the PHA Team's findings and recommendations are resolved in a timely manner, and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be taken; make certain that actions are taken as soon as possible; a written schedule of when these are to be completed; a system for communicating these actions to operating, maintenance and other personnel affected by these actions. \nOperations and Maintenance Training \nA general and unit specific Operations Training Program has been established at the Savanna Street facility in general and the Chlorination Systems in particular.

      "SummaryText": "Operations personnel are tested both based on their knowledge of various pertinent topics as well as by their performance (hands-on). \nInitial training emphasizes safety and health hazards as well as safe work practices. Operators can only work the unit themselves after being fully trained. Based upon Savanna Street RMP documentation, there are provisions for refresher training for each operator every year.                     \nPreventive Maintenance/Mechanical Integrity \nSavanna Street has resident stationary and rotating equipment maintenance and instrument mechanics. Process instrumentation is monitored and calibrated regularly. Meetings between Operations, Maintenance and Process Engineering personnel on maintenance issues, among other things, are conducted on a regular basis. Operating and maintenance personnel, among other things, are assessing the results of the non-destructive testing of the piping and equipment to determine what and where chlorination system equipment repairs, replacement and/or upgrades, due to corrosion, may be warranted. \nSince the chlorine supplier owns the ton cylinders of chlorine, the pressure vessel inspections are performed by them and documented.           \nManagement of Change \nThe written procedures (Checklist and Instructions) for the Management of Change (MOC) Risk Management Plan (RMP) were updated on June 5, 2009. There are provisions for informing employees who will be affected by the change as well as provisions for training them on the new items prior to the start-up of the process, or affected part of the process. The Area Manager must approve any changes before the changes begin.\nCompliance Audits \nThe last audit was conducted by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality conducted an audit on April 3, 2007. \nIncident Investigation \nAlthough there is a process for Incident and Accident investigations, there have not been any accidents or incidents at the Savanna Street Facility that warranted an investigation during the revie"

Chemical storage areas and process equipment are regularly inspected, repaired and upgraded to prevent accidental releases.  Should an accidental release occur, response activities will be coordinated through the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  On-site plant personnel are trained to make repairs to contain small accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant treats sewage from most of Jackson, East Rankin County and West Madison County, discharging the treated water into the Pearl River.  The plant uses chlorine gas to disinfect the wastewater.  Sulfur dioxide gas is used to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to being discharged into the river.  The chlorine gas is stored in 32 one-ton cylinders.  The sulfur dioxide gas is stored in 8 one-ton cylinders.  At a given time, 8 of the cylinders are connected on a single header.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA mand"

Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City Fire Department, City Police Department and Hinds County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  Through discussions in monthly Safety Meetings, through formal training conducted by the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control OperatorsA? Association and others and through annual emergency drills, plant operations and maintenance personnel will be properly trained in limited emergency response.  As the situation warrants, the public will be notified through the respective Public Affairs personnel at the Police, Fire and Public Works Departments and the EOC.  In the event telephone contact is not possible, emergency dispatch will be conducted using the City-wide radio system.\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety\n\nA UV system was installed to reduce the amount of chlorine used and the system has been re-engineered by the installation of vacuum regulators on all one-ton cylinders.  24 hours plant security has been added, and the Business Management system inplemented to assess risks."
