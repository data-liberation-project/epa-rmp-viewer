Process instrumentation is monitored and calibrated regularly. Meetings between Operations, Maintenance and Process Engineering personnel on maintenance issues, among other things, are conducted on a regular basis. Operating and maintenance personnel, among other things, are assessing the results of the non-destructive testing of the piping and equipment to determine what and where chlorination system equipment repairs, replacement and/or upgrades, due to corrosion, may be warranted. \nSince the chlorine supplier owns the ton cylinders of chlorine, the pressure vessel inspections are performed by them and documented.           \nManagement of Change \nThe written procedures (Checklist and Instructions) for the Management of Change (MOC) Risk Management Plan (RMP) were updated on June 5, 2009. There are provisions for informing employees who will be affected by the change as well as provisions for training them on the new items prior to the start-up of the process, or affected part of the process. The Area Manager must approve any changes before the changes begin.\nCompliance Audits \nThe last audit was conducted by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality conducted an audit on April 3, 2007. \nIncident Investigation \nAlthough there is a process for Incident and Accident investigations, there have not been any accidents or incidents at the Savanna Street Facility that warranted an investigation during the revie"

The site has 32,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time. The process has four (4) headers that are capable of feeding 8,000 pounds/header. The cylinders are on a standby/on-line basis to insure that the chlorination process is continuous. Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers.\n\nThe Trahon/Big Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater from the South Jackson and Byram areas. The facility discharges treated wastewater into Big Creek, thence to the Pearl River. The site has 4,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time. Sulfur Dioxide is stored in twelve (12) 150# cylinders. \nProcess Safety Information \nSavanna Street has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemical substances and equipment specification sheets for every single piece of equipment, each piece of equipment's upper and lower limits, approved operating procedures, training manuals and process description write-ups, maximum intended inventory, fire water drawin"

Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City Fire Department, City Police Department and Hinds County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  Through discussions in monthly Safety Meetings, through formal training conducted by the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators\u00c2\u00bf Association and others and through annual emergency drills, plant operations and maintenance personnel will be properly trained in limited emergency response.  As the situation warrants, the public will be notified through the respective Public Affairs personnel at the Police, Fire and Public Works Departments and the EOC.  In the event telephone contact is not possible, emergency dispatch will be conducted using the City-wide radio system.\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety\n\nA UV system was installed to reduce the amount of chlorine used and the system has been re-engineered by the installation of vacuum regulators on all one-ton cylinders.  24 hours plant security has been added, and the Business Management system inplemented to assess risks."
