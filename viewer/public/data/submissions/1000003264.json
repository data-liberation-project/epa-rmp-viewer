The site has 32,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time. The process has four (4) headers that are capable of feeding 8,000 pounds/header. The cylinders are on a standby/on-line basis to insure that the chlorination process is continuous. Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers.\n\nThe Trahon/Big Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater from the South Jackson and Byram areas. The facility discharges treated wastewater into Big Creek, thence to the Pearl River. The site has 4,000 pounds of chlorine stored at any given time. Sulfur Dioxide is stored in twelve (12) 150# cylinders. \nProcess Safety Information \nSavanna Street has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all chemical substances and equipment specification sheets for every single piece of equipment, each piece of equipment's upper and lower limits, approved operating procedures, training manuals and process description write-ups, maximum intended inventory, fire water drawin"

The PHA for the chlorination system discusses the hazards of the process, the engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazard as well as the consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls. This PHA was conducted May 18, 2009 and May 28, 2009.\nThere are provisions in its organizational infrastructure to accommodate a PHA Team which consist of an Area Manager, Safety Administrator, Two (2) Technicians, one (1) Lift Station Supervisor and a Chief Operator, who are responsible for conducting, updating and re-validating the analysis.\n\nIn addition to provisions for the PHA Team, there are written policies and procedures describing the team's purpose, goals and objectives, as well as how it functions. \n\nThere is documentation that shows not only has Savanna Street developed, but has actually implemented a PHA procedure that; promptly addresses the PHA Team's findings and recommendations are resolved in a timely manner, and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be taken; make certain that actions are taken as soon as possible; a written schedule of when these are to be completed; a system for communicating these actions to operating, maintenance and other personnel affected by these actions. \nOperations and Maintenance Training \nA general and unit specific Operations Training Program has been established at the Savanna Street facility in general and the Chlorination Systems in particular.

Process instrumentation is monitored and calibrated regularly. Meetings between Operations, Maintenance and Process Engineering personnel on maintenance issues, among other things, are conducted on a regular basis. Operating and maintenance personnel, among other things, are assessing the results of the non-destructive testing of the piping and equipment to determine what and where chlorination system equipment repairs, replacement and/or upgrades, due to corrosion, may be warranted. \nSince the chlorine supplier owns the ton cylinders of chlorine, the pressure vessel inspections are performed by them and documented.           \nManagement of Change \nThe written procedures (Checklist and Instructions) for the Management of Change (MOC) Risk Management Plan (RMP) were updated on June 5, 2009. There are provisions for informing employees who will be affected by the change as well as provisions for training them on the new items prior to the start-up of the process, or affected part of the process.
