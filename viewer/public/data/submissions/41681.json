      "SummaryText": "A.  Texon L.P. is committed to the safety of its workers, the public and the enironment.  Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures and training.  Texon has created a comprehensive propane accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  It has also developed an emergency action plan and coordinated these efforts with local emergency responders (Stoddard County Sheriff and Dexter Fire Department).\n\nB.  Texon L.P. operates a propane terminal in Dexter, MO.  Propane is received from a pipeline and is distributed by truck.  There are thirteen (13) 90,000-gallon tanks at the site holding approximately 310,000 pounds each of liquid propane.\n\nC.  The offsite consequence analysis considers the worst-case and an alternative scenario involving a propane release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The RMP Rule says the explosion endpoint is 1psi overpressure.\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves the failure of one of the 90,000-gallon tanks holding approximately 310,000 lbs. of propane.  It assumes all of the propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation is considered.  The explosion endpoint was identified as 0.5 miles (per RMP Comp Ver. 1.07).  A search of public receptors within this radius identified residential and commercial properties.  It is estimated that approximately 30 people would be impacted by this event.\n\nThe alternative scenario involves a propane release from a Multi-port 2.5-inch releif valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation considered in this scenario.  A total of 4,315 pounds of propane is ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum of 1 psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles.  This radius extends beyond the facility property boundaries but does not impact public receptors.\n\nD.
