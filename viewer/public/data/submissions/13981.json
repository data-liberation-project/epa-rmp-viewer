All operators working with the \n       chlorine system process will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator \n       training specific to the system.\n       To insure proper response to emergency situations, Berryville WWTP has implemented Emergency  \n        Action Plans as required by the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR \n       1910.120. All safety personal and operators of the process will be trained in these procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     Berryville WWTP has a staff of 6 working in a publicly owned wastewater treatment facility that treats \n     about 3,000,000 gallons a day. The effluent is treated with chlorine to disinfect it before release to a creek \n     that flows into the Osage creek and then into the Kings River and Table Rock Lake. There is never more \n     than 4,000 pounds of chlorine in the plant at any given time. \n\n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. \n     Worst case scenario-\n     Loss of cylinder valve resulting in a sudden and total of liquid chlorine and vaporization. 2,000 pounds \n     released for 10 minutes at 110 pounds per minute.
