This commitment is demonstrated by Heritage Farms' comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is Heritage Farms' policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such releases do occur, there are highly trained employees on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the releases.  The site also coordinates with the Murfreesboro Fire Department, who provides emergency response services.\n\n\n\n1.2    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (?68.155(b))\n\nThere is one (1) regulated substance present at this facility.  This substance is ammonia (anhydrous).  The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 25,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes). \n\n\n\n1.3    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (?68.155(c))\n\nThe facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part (?) 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.  The ammonia (anhydrous) process is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR ?1910.119.  In addition, the facility is also subject to the EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place. \n\n1.3.1    Process Safety Information:\n\nInformation related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the facility has been compiled.  Prior to conducting the initial and subsequent hazard analyses, the process safety inform"

The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.   \n\n1.3.2    Process Hazard Analysis: \n\nComprehensive studies were conducted to ensure that hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration process were identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses was the \"what-if/checklist\" approach.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n1.3.3    Operating Procedures: \n\nOperating procedures are maintained at the facility.  These procedures address the various modes of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process. \n\n1.3.4    Training: \n\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least once every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed. \n\n1.3.5    Mechanical Integrity: \n\nDocumented maintenance checks are conducted on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined during these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified pers"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n1.3.6    Management of Change: \n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modifications. \n\n1.3.7    Pre-Startup Reviews: \n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification of established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n1.3.8    Compliance Audits: \n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least once every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n1.3.9    Incident Investigation: \n\nIncidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are promptly investigated.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years. \n\n1.3.10    Employee Participation: \n\nHeritage Farms strongly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, the emp"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Heritage Farms has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \n\n\n\n1.4    Five-Year Accident History (?68.155(d))\n\nHeritage Farms has not had any reportable accidents or incidents during the past five (5) years. \n\n\n\n1.5    Emergency Response Plan (?68.155(e))\n\nThis facility has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and nearby responders.  This facility has its own Emergency Action Plan as well.  The Emergency Action Plan includes actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances as well as procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. \n\n\n\n1.6    Planned Changes to Improve Safety (?68.155(f))\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the accidental release prevention program.
