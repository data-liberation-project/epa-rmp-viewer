              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work\n\nwith our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\n\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal\n\ngrain elevators,\" however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and\n\nreloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage.\" Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only\n\nproduct subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle propane for both agricultural\n\nuses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance. We include propane (as well as all crop protectants\n\nand petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will\n\nbe included in this report.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.\n\nDuring the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.

We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency\n\nresponse personnel; and have provided and /or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.
