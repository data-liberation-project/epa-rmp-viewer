The only materials considered hazardous at this facility are anhydrous ammonia and aqua (a 20 wt% solution of ammonia in water).  Our facility has one 25,000-gallon tank for storing anhydrous, and one 15,000 gallon and one 30,000-gallon tank for storing aqua, equipment for receiving anhydrous and aqua by truck, and equipment for transferring anhydrous and aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\n\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n\n\n1.  Excess flow valves to prevent flow from a tank or truck if any anyhdrous hose or line breaks.\n\n2.  Pressure relief valves on the anhydrous storage tanks to prevent overpressuring and rupturing the tanks.\n\n3.  Diking around the aqua storage area, to contain accidental aqua spills.\n\n\n\nSite-specific process safety information is tabulated below.  \n\n\n\nMSDS Aqua (Y, N):    Y        \n\nMax. Intended Inventory, Anhydrous:    22,000 gal.    114,000 lb.\n\nMax.
