It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nWe at City of Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jasper Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nCity of Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant complies with the EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary sourc"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, City of Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nCity of Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the processes. \n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nThe City of Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts regular maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n    \n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nOur personnel conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of regulated chemicals that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe City of Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant employees will not respond to a chemical emergency at the plant. As required by 40 CFR Part 68.90, the City of Jasper is included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
