Our emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Ashtabula County Emergency Management Agency and the Ashtabula Township Fire Department.\n\n\nOperations at all INEOS facilities, including Ashtabula Complex, Plant 2, are continually reviewed by onsite management to ensure we use the most up to date release prevention and emergency response programs and meet all applicable regulations.  Whenever methods for safer operation are found at either of our facilities, these are immediately applied, to the extent applicable, at the other facility.  In this way we will continue to maintain a high standard for safety and environmental protection in all of our facilities."

These processes are called the Chlorination and Oxidation processes and each handles and stores chlorine and titanium tetrachloride as an important part of their operation.  We have assessed the risks that our handling and storage of these substances could present to public health and environment by performing offsite consequence analyses in \"worst case\" and \"alternative release\" scenarios.  \n\nOur analysis of the offsite consequences for both processes determined that the worst case release would be represented by a release of the contents of a railcar containing chlorine, which, although very unlikely to occur, could result in a release of 180,000 lbs. of chlorine.  Under winds of 3.4 mph the resulting plume could affect a portion of an area within 14 miles of the facility before being reduced below the toxic endpoint.  This area includes an estimated population of 74000 persons, 30,500 residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas and major commercial, office and industrial areas.  \n\nOur continuing analysis of release scenarios also addresses more credible situations that reflect actual operating conditions for each process.  These include situations such as tank overflows, pipe ruptures and equipment failures.  This analysis has determined that the most serious of such releases could impact a portion of an area within 0.4 miles of our facility in the case of chlorine and 0.2 miles in the case of titanium tetrachloride.  \n\nAccident History\n\nA release occurred on May 17, 2024, at 01:00 am and was the result of equipment failure from over-pressurization.  89 pounds of Titanium Tetrachloride was released.  INEOS was notified of one neighboring facility employee seeking medical attention attributed to the release.\n\nA 1.3 lbs release of chlorine occurred on September 24, 2024, at 9:24 am as a result of equipment failure from a transfer line.
