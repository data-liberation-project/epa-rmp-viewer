      "SummaryText": "Fresh Express\nProcess Safety and Risk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n\n1.  This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Fresh Express is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \n\n2.  Fresh Express utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for its production of packaged salads.  Refrigeration is necessary for conditioning the room air in production areas, cooling water used as a secondary coolant, and maintaining product at desired temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia was selected because of its excellent heat transfer capabilities.\n\n3.  The following is a description of the worst case scenario.\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 47,350 pounds of ammonia with the rece"

      "SummaryText": "iver quantity limited to 80% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n6.  Accident History\nThe facility has had no reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n7.  Emergency Response\nTechnicians responsible for the safe operation have received HAZMAT training.  The Process Safety and Risk Management program requires that the individuals responsible for the emergency operations receive annual training.  The state of Georgia is equipped with a HAZMAT team to assist the plant.  The plant will continue to update and review the emergency response program with all additional employees.\n\n8.  Changes to improve safety\nFresh Express is very grateful of their employees and stresses their safety.  For this reason new employees go through orientation prior to employment.  The plant employs a full time safety director.  The corporate office also has a safety director, and the plant performs audits of the operation continuously."
