The IMTT-Geismar facility is a bulk liquids storage terminal, providing tank storage capacity for customers. The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment. The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals. The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occur.\n\n(b)  Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe IMTT-Geismar terminal requires an RMP because it stores four compounds in excess of the RMP threshold quantities as identified in the Federal Register, January 31, 1994. These include the following:\nCyclohexylamine [CAS # 108-91-8]\nDimethylamine [CAS # 124-40-3]\nPropylene oxide [CAS # 75-56-9]\nToluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) [CAS # 26471-62-5] \n\n(c)  Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nDuring the development of the Risk Management Plan, IMTT-Geismar facility identified the following scenarios using the guidance provided by the EPA.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios:\n\n(1)  Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of cyclohexylamine from a storage tank with offsite impacts.  The storage tank is inside a diked area which limits the impact of the release. \n\n(2)  Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine from a storage tank with offsite impacts.  The storage tank is inside a diked area which limits the impact of the release.\n\n(3)  Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of a toxic mixture containin"

The storage tank is inside a diked area which limits the impact of the release.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\n(1)  Release of cyclohexylamine from a leak from a 1 inch diameter hole without off-site impacts.  \n\n(2)  Vapor cloud fire resulting from the release of dimethylamine from a leak from a 1 inch diameter hole in liquid space of tank without off-site impacts.  \n\n(3)  Release of propylene oxide from a leak from a 1 inch diameter hole without off-site impacts.  \n\n(4)  Release of a toxic mixture containing toluene 2,4-diisocyanate and toluene 2,6-diisocyanate from a leak from a 1 inch diameter hole without off-site impacts.  \n\n(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIMTT-Geismar sustains an extensive accidental release prevention program.  Safety information is retained regarding the materials, tanks, and associated equipment for all materials and regulated substances handled on site.  Hazard analyses have been conducted for the regulated processes.        \n\nIMTT-Geismar operators are trained in the appropriate procedures and receive additional safety training.\n\nIMTT-Geismar maintains an extensive maintenance program and provides continued inspection and maintenance of tanks and loading and unloading systems at the terminal.\n\nIncidents are recorded through an incident investigation program with prompt follow-up.\n\n(e)  Five-year Accident History\n\nAs this is a first time submission, IMTT-Geismar has no reportable accidents in the last five years. \n\n(f)  Emergency Response Program\n\nIMTT-Geismar maintains a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment.
