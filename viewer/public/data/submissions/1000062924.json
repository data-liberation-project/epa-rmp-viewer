The natural gas then is delivered to a transmission gas pipeline, and the NGLs are trucked out.  The NGLs are a flammable mixture consisting of multiple regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. \n\n\n\nOperators of the facility have a commitment to safety and accident prevention.  This commitment is demonstrated by upper management support of an active EH&S program. An employee training program is implemented as part of a comprehensive EH&S management system.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical process parameters are monitored remotely on a 24 hour basis using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technology.  This enables operation without full-time personnel.  There are numerous safety systems and administrative controls to prevent releases, including isolation of the tank, pressure relief valves, temperature and pressure monitoring, and an ESD.\n\n\n\nAs indicated there are zero public receptors within the endpoint boundary, there have not been any accidental releases for the 5-year accident history, and there is communication with the local fire department (LEPC), therefore the facility is eligible for Program 1 status,\n\n\n\nEmployees are not stationed at this facility, and they will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  Response is from the Lower Valley Fire Dist.  The gas control room (monitoring/emergency contact) calling 911 and the Field operations coordinator are the mechanisms in place for notifying for emergency responders.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the facility indicates that the WCS distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is 0.4 miles. The figure included in the consequence analysis presents the location of the subject facility and the boundaries of the WCS consequence endpoint.\n\n\n\nAs indicated, there zero public r"
