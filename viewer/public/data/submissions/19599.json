The company policy at Service Gas inc. is to keep our employees trained and aware of the regulations that go along with the handling and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. This is done by having employees participate in annual NH3 schools provided by The Department of Agriculture and the Illinois Fertilizer and Chemical Association. Each employee must pass a written test at the end of each session. It is also our policy to keep our pumps, transfer hoses and nurse tanks in good working order. Respirators, slickers,gloves and goggles are provided for saftey and emergencys, should one arise. Water tanks are kept clean and full during times NH3 is being handled. The 10 Commandments of Handling Anhydrous Ammonia is reviewed often and posted where employees can review it often. Employees who have not been properly trained are not allowed to handle product. Service Gas holds saftey meeting, all employees must participate and sign a minute sheet verifying their attendance.\n\n2.    Service Gas Inc. is located at 17747 Somonauk Rd. DeKalb, Illinois, 60115. We are at a Lattitude of 41 53 32 and a longitude of -88 41 24.7. Our phone number is (815) 756-8484 and we have a night answering\nservice for emergencies (at the same number). There are 11 employees working full time, and 2 on a occasional partime basis (office help). In addition to NH3 we are also a propane distributer. Mark Carpenter\nis the owner and responsible for RMP implementation. Mr. Carpenter is also the emergency contact. Business hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday,  9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Saturday. Longer hours are worked during peak season (spring).\n\n3.    Our largest Anhydrous storage tank contains 60,000 pounds of product and would reflect our\" worst case scenerio\".  Nominal piping is 2\" and could release 6,000 pounds per minute with an end point of 1.15\nmiles. This is based on a 10 minute release duration.  \n\n4.    Accidental release is minimized by keeping our employees trained on"

This includes how to identify problems with tranfer hoses, pumps, personal saftey equipment, as well as making sure they understand how to operate NH3 related valves, pumps, and all equipment involved in the piping system.\nBackcheck valves, relief valves, shutoffs at strategic locations and routine maintenance all aid in preventing accidental releases from occurring. All valves are shut tightly at the end of each business day.\n\n5.    Service Gas Inc. has had no accidents resulting in personal injury or property damage in the past five years.\n\n6.     Our emergency response plan includes names and numbers of those living with in our end point. These names are on file in our office and have been provided to the Cortland and DeKalb fire departments so that a quick evacuation can be made in the event of a major release. We have gone over our grounds with the Cortland fire fighters in the past, so that they are familiar with the premises. To assist them further, a complete lay out of our facility has been submitted to them on paper. This includes precise information on what is stored or located in various buildings and locations at Service Gas Inc. It also includes emergency phone numbers so that an employee can be quickly located. They have been informed of the danger involved when coming in direct contact with NH3 and are aware of the first-aid needed to treat exposure to NH3. Employees understand the importance of shutting main valves immediately to reduce a release and have been instructed of the proper use of personal safety equipment. In the event of a tank rupture where a release could not be controlled, employees have been instructed to call 911and vacate the premises.\nIn the event this would happen, they have been instructed to drive away to a safe distance and stop traffic in both directions until the police or fire department arrives. We will continue to work with local fire departments and up date them when changes are made.\n\n7.     Future p"

We will do this in the summer of 1999, so that it will be complete for our fall anhydrous season. Also, we will make improvements to our riser and filling area. We believe ongoing education is of vital importance and will go far to reduce the likelyhood of an incident. Though maintenance records have been kept on nurse tanks and tool bars, we will be keeping records on pump and storage facilities to be sure that details such as weed control are taken care of in the future."
