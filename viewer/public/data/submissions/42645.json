If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and the authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 380,000 pounds.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of th U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Aministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydroius Amnmonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fives years that:\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has:\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evalutions are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations "
