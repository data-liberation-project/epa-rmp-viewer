      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary June 11, 2004\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Flex-O-Lators Division of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated uses iso-butane as a process-blowing agent for foam, which is considered a regulated flammable substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make iso-butane valuable also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in it??A?s handling so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure.  We are dedicated to conducting our operations in compliance with environmental laws and in a safe and responsible manner.  We do not want to put at risk the environment, employees, or the public.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of the employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  We will continue to commit resources and to take appropriate steps to comply with environmental laws.  We may adopt additional standards and procedures beyond those required by law if the company deems them advisable.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which iso-butane is handled combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  \n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture, store, and ship polyethylene foam extrusion products.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is iso-butane.  The maximum amount of iso-butane that can be stored at this facility is 27,436 pounds.  See appendix for MSDS on iso-butane.\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable Federal and State codes and regulations.

      "SummaryText": "This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  The iso-butane manufacturer ships and delivers the product using their equipment and drivers.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including but not limited to:\n\n??A?    Operating Procedures\n??A?    Training\n??A?    Compliance Audits\n??A?    Incident Investigation\n??A?    Employee Participation\n??A?    Inspections\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  The company and the employees are committed to the standard that the management systems set for the way we do business and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of iso-butane in the past five years; therefore the company does not have an accident to report.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe company maintains a Plant Emergency Organization (PEO) and emergency response plan.  The emergency response program is based upon Leggett & Platt corporate policies, and procedures as outline in LEGGETT & PLATT PERSONNEL & PROPERTY CONSERVATION MANUAL.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Response activities are coordinated with the Carthage Fire Department.  Company employees will act to provide incidental response to mitigate an iso-butane release.  If the event is beyond the scope of an accidental response, employees will evacuate and call the Carthage Fire Department.  The Carthage Fire Department will initiate the community emergency plan for an iso-butane release.\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe building was constructed in 1972-1973 and is in compliance with the NFPA-5"

      "SummaryText": "8 Standard, 1998 edition.  The foam extrusion process was installed in 1994.  Improvements were made in 2000 when a new extruder was installed.  The company does not have any formal plans to improve safety, but is continually looking for ways to improve safety.\n\n7.0 Certifications\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, our Risk Management Program is written to comply with Program Level 2.  The distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario may impact the small residential population surrounding the facility.\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused off-site impacts provided in the RMP rule [40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)].  We have taken voluntary measures to improve our operations to minimize potential releases of covered materials in order to protect both our employees and the public.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMPlan.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSignature:___________________________________ Date:____________\n\nTitle:_______________________________________\n\n8.0 RMP Data Elements\n\nThe following pages present additional information about our Risk Management Program the EPA??A?s RMP rule has asked us to provide.
