      "SummaryText": "Carthage Water and Electrics' Water Treatment Plant is a 6MGD facility.  Our water supply comes from 13 deep wells.  Our treatments include the addition of lime for softening, fluoride, chlorine and ammonia.  We add the ammonia to form chloramines for disinfection purposes.  We have four rapid sand filters that are sand and anthracite.\n\nThe substance for which we are filing this report is Chlorine.  We have the capabilities of storing up to 6000 lbs. at any one time.  We normally range from 3500 to 5500 pounds on hand at any one time.  Our chlorine is received in ton containers and stored on racks.  The racks are located outside of our filter building with a canopy to cover them. They are otherwise  exposed to the atmosphere. \n\nOur facility is located on the northeast edge of the town of Carthage.  In the immediate vicinity of our facility are several residences, two factories, a glass shop, the vocational-technical building for Carthage public schools, a state park and a city park.  \n\nIn order to decrease the chances for a possible leak at our facility we have implemented several administrative control measures.  It is standard policy that any time that the chlorine tanks are changed out that there are two people present.  We feel that with our system that this is the time that has the highest risk of a release of chlorine.  All operators receive training on the proper techniques for changing cylinders.  We change out cylinders on average once every 28 days.  Our facility also uses a vacuum system to deliver our chlorine.  This minimizes the chance of leaking lines to a minimum.  Other administrative controls include hands on training in the use of SCBA?s (self contained breathing apparatus), installing the class ?B? leak kit to the ton cylinders, proper operation of the chlorine feed system and procedures if a leak should occur.  \n\nWe have two SCBA?s located in immediate vicinity of the chlorine tanks and another one located at the warehouse which is approximately"

      "SummaryText": " 100 yards from the treatment facility.  We have a chlorine alarm that is equipped with two sensors.  One is located in the chlorine room and the other is located in the basement where the chlorine solution is fed into the water line.  These alarms are tested on a monthly basis for proper operation.  The alarm has a flashing red light as well as an audible alarm.  The alarm is also indicated by a red light on our operating control panel located in our office. It is also standard procedure to test the operation of automatic switch-over valves when we change out cylinders.  This occurs on averaged every 28 days.\n\nOther control procedures that we have incorporated into our facility are to review the MSDS (material safety data sheets) on a regular basis.  Review health effects and proper procedure for the contacting of emergency personnel and review of our Emergency Operating Procedures on a 6 month basis.  \n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving chlorine release at this facility.\n\nIn regards to section 1.11 employees at site, there are only 5 full time employees at the Water Plant but the facility also has a warehouse and power plant to bring the total to 40."
