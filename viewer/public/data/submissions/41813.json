The operations at the Medina facility include the processing and storage of perishable prepared food products for public consumption.  These products are packaged and distributed throughout the eastern United States under several familiar brand names.  Sandridge has been in operation at this facility for 20 years providing quality products and over 250 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSandridge is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Sandridge corporate policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of Sandridge\u00bfs ingredients and final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  These requirements are promulgated and monitored by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Ohio State Department of Agriculture, and the United States Food and Drug Administration.  To achieve this, Sandridge uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112(r) regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.  The ammonia refrigeration system maintains the 110,000 square-foot facility within the required range of operating temperatures and provides the cooling necessary for the storage of fresh ingredients and the production of various peris"

Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sandridge, any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees.\n\nSandridge understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Sandridge has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  In addition, equipment inspections are performed throughout the year to confirm the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components.\n\nTo ensure that the control measures at Sandridge are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system and other plant equipment, periodic audits are performed as follows:\n\nIn accordance with the plant\u00bfs PSM program, Sandridge conducts process safety compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates a review of process safety information, process hazards analyses, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up safety review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and the contractor safety management program.\n\nIn addition, the facilities and/or records of Sandridge are inspected and audited by the following:\n\n\u00bf The City of Medina Fire Department\n\n\u00bf The Ohio State Department of Agriculture\n\n\u00bf The United States Department of Agriculture\n\n\u00bf The United States Food and Drug Administration \n\nSandridge\u00bfs insurance carrier also conducts independent loss prevention audits every year.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Sandridge plant is included in the written comm"

The refrigeration system at Sandridge Food Corporation\u00bfs Medina facility is a closed loop system and consists of compressors, condensers, receiver vessels, pumps, evaporators, heat exchangers, air handling units, and the associated piping for this equipment.  The system can contain a maximum amount of approximately 21,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at any time during the course of the year.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance, covered by the EPA\u00bfs Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions and the associated Risk Management Program requirements, that is used at the Medina facility.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years of operation, Sandridge has not experienced any reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Furthermore, there has not been a reportable release of ammonia from the system since its initial installation in 1990. \n\n \nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Sandridge Food Corporation has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release, over a 10-minute period, of the entire contents of the largest vessel or pipe in the facility\u00bfs system.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations, however, based on the facility\u00bfs operating history, it is not considered by Sandridge Food Corporation to be a likely release scenario for the facility.  A more realistic release scenario (alternative case release) was developed in accordance with the EPA requirements.  This scenario considers the facility\u00bfs 20-year history of operational experience and the potential hazards identified in the process hazards analysis (PHA) study conducted by Sandridge.  The PHA study was performed to ensure that the potential haza"

The chemical-specific endpoints, established for release scenarios by the EPA, provide conservative estimates of the distances that a chemical could possibly travel in the event of an accidental release meeting the EPA\u00bfs specified criteria. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent, detect, and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sandridge has implemented several precautionary measures including process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with recognized industry codes and standards and good engineering practices. \n\nSandridge has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the refrigeration system for the potential to release anhydrous ammonia.  Some of the controls installed to prevent, detect, or mitigate catastrophic releases of ammonia include process equipment (pressure relief valves, check valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs), process alarms, and automated controls (automatic shutoffs, microprocessor control, ammonia leak detection systems, and electrical distribution system grounding). \n\nSandridge has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.
