      "SummaryText": "The Wells Enterprise, Inc. North Ice Cream Plant (NICP) is an ice cream manufacturing facility. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the NICP refrigeration system, which serves the manufacturing process.  A Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed for the use and storage of anhydrous ammonia in the NICP refrigeration system. The RMP program was established to meet and address the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nThe prevention portion of the RMP is addressed through the implementation of OSHA's process safety management (PSM) program. The PSM program is implemented in its entirety to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. The facility PSM programs includes, but is not limited to the following elements: Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre Start-up Safety Review, Standard Operating Procedures, and Operator Training. The various facets of PSM and RMP are linked through documentation and communication.\n\n\n\nPresently, there have been zero incidents involving ammonia in the past five years that meet the definition of an accident as defined in the RMP program. \n\n\n\nEmergency response plans for various personnel and chemical emergencies are integrated into an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) for the facility.  The ICP documents the processes of emergency response, training, resource management, and data tracking for a wide range of accident or emergencies that may occur at this facility.  Training is provided to on-site emergency responders (HAZMAT) as well as local fire department personnel that may be asked to assist in the case of an accident. \n\n\n\nThe facility continues an ongoing effort to implement safety enhancement features of the ammonia refrigeration system.
