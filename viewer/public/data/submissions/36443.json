      "SummaryText": "Hallsmith Sysco Food Services is a food service wholesale distribution and storage facility. The facility has an Ammonia refrigeration system which services a variety of coolers and freezers in the plant. Hallsmith Sysco has had a Process Safety Program in place since 1994 with a modern refrigeration system. The system is maintained daily with a state licensed refrigeration technician who is a full time employee. The only material covered under this submission is Anhydrous Ammonia. The entire system holds approximately  19,000 pounds. The largest vessel can hold about 17,500 pounds and worst case scenario is estimated to be 80% of that tank which is controlled automatically to never fill any higher. This defines the worst case release to be 14,000 pounds in a short period of time. The refrigeration system is housed in a separate attached building to the main facility which would restrict any releases from immediately contacting the outside air. The facility has manyammonia detection systems throughout the plant for leak detection. In the event of an Ammonia leak - the facility is evacuated and the Norton Fire Department and LEPC is contacted. Maintenance personnel are only allowed to assist the Norton LEPC - employees are not allowed to respond directly. There have been no accidental releases of Ammonia in the last five years. The facility recently completed their three year Process Safety Management Program Audit as well as an overall safety audit on which the facilty did well. The programs remain proactive to minimize risk and keep this critical refrigeration system at a high level of maintenance."
