ALL OPERATORS OF THE WATER CHLORINATION SYSTEM ARE TRAINED IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE STORAGE, HANDLING, AND PROCESS USE OF CHLORINE.  THEY ARE TRAINED IN THE DANGERS OF CHLORINE, PROCESS OVERVIEW, STORAGE, MOVEMENT, AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES OF THE PROCESS, AS WELL AS PRE-START AND OPERATIONAL MECHANICAL INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND OPERATIONAL PARAMETER TESTING, AS WELL AS SHUT-DOWN AND EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN PROCEDURES.  OPERATORS ARE ALSO TRAINED IN START-UP AFTER TURNAROUND PROCEDURES, TEMPORARY OPERATIONS, AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS,  EMERGENCY AND EVACUATION PLANS.  OPERATOR TRAINING AND TESTING ARE DOCUMENTED.  WRITTEN OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE PROVIDED TO THE OPERATORS AND MAINTAINED IN THE WORK AREA.  INSPECTIONS ARE PERFORMED ON A DAILY, AND YEARLY BASIS TO ASSURE SAFE OPERATIONAL STATUS OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS.  CRITICAL SAFEGUARD COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM SUCH AS CHLORINE REGULATOR / AUTOMATIC VACUUM SHUT-OFF VALVES ARE REMOVED, INSPECTED, SERVICED, TESTED, AND RE-INSTALLED / REPLACED AND CHECKED FOR SAFE OPERATION YEARLY.  ANY CHANGES TO THE PROCESS ARE MANAGED SO THAT EMPLOYEES THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY SUCH CHANGES AS WELL AS PROCESS OPERATORS ARE TRAINED IN THE PARTICULARS OF ANY NEW EQUIPMENT OR PROCEDURES.  ACCIDENTS / INCIDENTS THAT DID OR COULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CHLORINE WILL BE INVESTIGATED IMMEDIATELY ( OR NO LATER THAN 48 HOURS), BY A PERSON KNOWLEDGABLE IN THE PROCESS CAPABLE OF DEVELOPING A  REPORT TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS INVOLVED AND PROVIDE MEANS FOR THEIR CORRECTION.  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES HAVE AND WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE HAZARDS IN TRAINING, EQUIPMENT, PROCEDURES, POSSIBLE ACTS OF NATURE, DOCUMENTATION, CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES, MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE, EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS, SAFE STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF CHLORINE.  ADDITIONALLY, COMPLIANCE AUDITS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS, TO EVALUATE AND CERTIFY THAT PROCESS SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING MET.
