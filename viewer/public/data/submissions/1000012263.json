      "SummaryText": "The Airgas facility in Miami, Florida is owned and operated by Airgas South. The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.\n\nThe Facility operates from 0600 hours to 1500 hours, Monday through Friday and is staffed with approximately 11 full time employees.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, security cameras, and yard lights. \n\nIn accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facilityA?s inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity: \n\n- Acetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\n\nAcetylene is packaged in a variety of cylinder sizes; including 24 pound, 12 pound, 5 pound, 1 pound and smaller.  The maximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 20,000 pounds. The largest acetylene containers at the facility are the 24 lbs storage cylinders.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case release amount for the Miami plant is therefore 24 lbs of acetylene, which is the amount of flammable substance in the largest vessel filled to capacity.  EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 24 lbs of acetylene.  The print-out of the worst-case RMP*Comp modeling analysis is presented in Attachment A.  This scenario represents all flammable substances on site, as described above.  \n\nIn consultation with Miami plant personnel and AirgasA? Safety Director, a leak in a 24-pound acetylene cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released propane would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute."
