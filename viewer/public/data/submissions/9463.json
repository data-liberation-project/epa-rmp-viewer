The gas plant, located in the Whitney Canyon / Carter Creek gas field (approx. 35 miles North and East of Evanston Wyoming), was designed to process 150 mmscfd of natural occurring hydrocarbon gas and natural gas liquids\n \n Chevron has approximately 85 employees, and contractors working for the Asset.  Consisting of Operations, Maintenance and support staff \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Chevron USA Production Company to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environment. The CCGP Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident; developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks; communicating relevant information to employees, contractors and appropriate agencies; and conducting emergency exercises.\n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES\n\nProcess 1- Well Stream separation and stabilization\n\nThe well stream separation area is designed to handle about 150 MMCF maximum of gas per day. Approximately 3000 barrels of hydrocarbon condensate will be recovered from this gas.\n\nThe well stream enters the plant as a three-phase stream: gas, hydrocarbon condensate, and free water. The gas and liquid is separated in the V-1101 (Slug Catcher). The gas is then filtered and treated. The hydrocarbon condensate is depressured, stripped of H2S, and stabilized. The free water is degassed of H2S and sent to sour liquids blowdown.\n\nProcess 2- NGL and moisture extraction\n\nThe treated high pressure gas that meets pipeline H2S specification is sent to Process 2 for NGL extraction and dew point control before being routed into the N.G.L. sales pipeline.\n\nTreated high pressure gas is chilled to -20F chiller operating temperature which is controlled to ensure that the sales gas hydrocarbon dew point requirement of 15F and water"

Chilling is supplied by a propane refrigeration system\n\nHydrocarbons condensed and collected in the V-1301 (Glycol Separator) during chilling are used as feed stock for the N.G.L. system where the natural gas liquids are stabilized (de-methanized) and then shipped to the N.G.L.  sales pipeline. \n\nProcess 3- H2S removal and Sulfur recovery\n\nThe H2S Removal system is designed to remove H2S from the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gases from the Plant inlet. The gas streams are fed to high, medium, and low pressure Absorbers for contacting with DEA solution. H2S is absorbed into the DEA.\n\nThe DEA is regenerated to produce a gas stream containing H2S and water vapor (steam), which is further processed for conversion to elemental sulfur. The regenerated DEA is recirculated to the H2S Absorbers.\n\nThe H2S liberated from the DEA is reacted and converted to elemental sulfur utilizing the Claus Sulfur Recovery process (SRU) and the Beavon Stretford Sulfur Recovery Process (BSRP)\n\nThe tail gas from the Plant is then heated and lofted to the atmosphere at or below Wyoming State DEQ permitted levels for emission components.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES ABOVE THRESHOLD QUANTITIES AT CCGP\n\nThere are three RMP defined processes with threshold quantities of regulated substances at CCGP including:\n\nProcess 1:\n\nInlet flows and quantities of flammable, naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane. The total quantities found in the process vessels, process piping and equipment of 590,000 lbs.\n\nProcess 2:\n\nFlammable hydrocarbon mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane associated with NGL removal from the sales gas stream and propane refrigeration systems. The total quantities in the process vessels, process piping and equipment of 130,000 lbs.\n\nProcess 3:\n\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S) associated with the naturally occur"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, operating procedures, job safety analyses and compiling chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.\n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the CCGP accident prevention program element. \n\nThe CCGP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nChevron ensures that the processes are designed, constructed, operated and maintained within specifications, standards and limits set and accepted by the industry and (or) Company \n\nThe processes are controlled and monitored using instruments, highly trained personnel and protective systems (e.g. distributive control systems, automated detection, emergency shutdown systems, closed blowdown systems, pressure relief valves, pressure control valves, remotely located flare systems, etc.).\n\nCCGP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

These individuals will be able, and required to respond to related emergencies at the CCGP\n\nThe training these individuals receive is in the area of Incident Command System, Emergency Response, Confined space Response, Basic Emergency Care, P.P.E., and basic Rescue Techniques. They have training that insures they know how to respond to all Areas and processes of the facility, and know how to deal with the different hazards associated with those Areas and processes.\n\nBasic training shall be conducted either in house, at the Fire Training Ground, the Safety Building or other approved locations.
