All pressure vessels were built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.  Construction met the applicable codes, standards, and specifications in place at the time of construction.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered an extremely hazardous substance by EPA, with the threshold quantity being 10,000 lbs.  Currently the system contains 15,968 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, which requires reporting to the EPA.  It is the policy of the Monson Fruit Co. to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  \n\nThe safety of our employees, neighbors and the environment are very important to the Monson Fruit Co.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, Standard Operating and Maintenance Procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are important to maintaining safety at our facility.  \n\nMonson Fruit Co. has a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017, including an Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with our local emergency responder.  It is the policy of the Monson Fruit Co. not to respond to large releases of ammonia.  Therefore, employees are trained on evacuation and shelter in place procedures at least once every year.  The responding fire or hazmat team will take control of the scene upon arrival.  Other preventative measures are found in our process safety information, process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, employee training, contractor, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management o"
