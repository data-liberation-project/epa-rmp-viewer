If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company operates a variety of processes in petroleum refining to manufacture products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, asphalt, butane, and propane) from raw crude oil. Most of the processes use heat, catalyst, and pressure to manufacture the above products from the crude. \n\n\n\nThe refinery has the following Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated flammables i"

Ten RMP processes were identified at the facility per the 40 CFR Part 68, guidelines implementation. Our facility is a petroleum refinery under NAICS code 32411. Nine processes are defined as and should meet the requirements of Program Level 3, and one process is classified as a Program 1 process.\n\n\n\nWe are reporting the following three regulated chemicals in the RMPlan:\n\n\n\n* Flammable Mixtures: This represents the mixture of pentane and lighter hydrocarbons found in the piping and process units, and stored in tank farm vessels. The volumes of these hydrocarbons vary by day. The maximum quantity of Flammable Mixtures onsite is 23.8 million pounds.\n\n\n\n* Butanes: This represents a butane/butene mix in storage. The maximum quantity butanes onsite is 2.5 million pounds.\n\n\n\n* Propane. The Maximum quantity of propane onsite is 29,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nH2S and SO2 in the refinery do not meet threshold levels. We have four units that process or remove H2S from the processes. Our total amount does not exceed the RMP threshold quantities for these substances; therefore, we do not trigger RMP. Prevention and safety programs are in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nIn the past, the Casper Refinery used chlorine to treat water for its boilers and cooling towers. As part of the offsite consequence analysis required under RMP, Sinclair determined that the potential impact of chlorine on the surrounding may be large.

For all RMP Program 3 processes at the Casper facility, RMP allows us to use OSHAs PSM standard as our prevention program.

This information is stored with the Inspection and Testing department.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  \n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company has a comprehensive analysis program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP is a very systematic and thorough evaluation of potential hazards in the process unit.

New operators are paired with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks. All new operators are tested on what they have learned, both by study and by demonstration. When operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. All operators periodically receive refresher training in operations to ensure that their skills and knowledge are at a proper level.

The final resolution of each finding is tracked and documented, and the two most recent audits are retained onsite as part of the PSM/RMP file.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nThe processes at Sinclair Casper Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continuous safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all of our Program Level 3 RMP-covered processes. The prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program, Sinclair has safety features on many units to help contain/control releases, detect releases, and reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various process units:\n\n\n\nRelease detection\n\n\n\n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n\n\n* H2S detectors with alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a monitored flare system. The flares capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n\n\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high or low temperature, material, levels, pressures, etc.)\n\n\n\n* Alarms for specific process parameters\n\n\n\n* Vessels to remove process inventory in the event or a release (tank storage, bypass systems)\n\n\n\n* Concrete curbing to contain liquid release to unit areas only\n\n\n\n* Redundant instrumentation and equipment (spare and backup systems)\n\n\n\n* Atmospheric relief valves\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n\n\n* Deluge system for specific equipment\n\n\n\n* Trained emergency response personnel (both refinery personnel and local emergency response personnel)\n\n\n\n* Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n\n\n* Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\n\n\n* Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n\n\n\n* Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n\n\n\n* Cleanup and decontamination requirements\n\n\n\nIn addition, Sinclair has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. \n\n\n\nEmployees receive, as part of their initial and ongoing refinery training, instructions and procedures for carrying out their specific emergency response duties.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes, changes in legal requirements, or refinery policy. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Sinclair Casper Refinery is coordinated with the Natrona County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). LEPC members include local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Sinclair Casper Refinery has periodic meet"

This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the periodic meetings, the Sinclair Casper Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and\n\nemergency response organizations. We invite these organizations to train with us at our site to achieve a dual purpose:\n\n\n\n* To provide annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the layout of the facility and the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n\n\n\n* To ensure that local emergency responders get to meet and interact with Sinclairs personnel in addressing response actions.\n\n\n\nThe fulfillment of these purposes help us ensure we meet the requirements of the emergency response program and have a practiced and effective plan in place that has the full confidence of the LEPC and local emergency response groups.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nThe Sinclair Casper Refining Company resolves all safety-related findings from PHAs and other safety issues, some of which results in modifications to processes. For each modification, changes will be made to procedures and processes to ensure that they match the new equipment or changes. All affected personnel will be trained prior to their operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nSinclair Casper Refining Company Environmental Policy: \n\nSinclair Casper Refining Company recognizes its responsibility to protect and improve the quality of the environment. This responsibility will be accomplished through Sinclairs commitment to:\n\n\n\n* Establish and maintain a professional and active management ream to promote and enhance our environmental performance.\n\n\n\n* Achieve excellence in management of our environmental duties through education and compliance with all local, state, an"
