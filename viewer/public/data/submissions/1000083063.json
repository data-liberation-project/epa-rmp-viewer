These standards include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets such that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n\u00bf\tCorrecting findings identified in regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nFHR is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. The Longview facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances to the environment. However, if a release does occur, trained FHR personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident. Details on the emergency response program are outlined in Section 2.1.6.\r\nAdditionally, Eastman policies applicable to the unit are summarized in the Eastman Principles of Safety document. Eastman conducts all aspects of its business in a manner that provides for the safety of employees, contractors, communities, customers, and the environment.
