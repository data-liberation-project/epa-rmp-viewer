PAALP\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Cordova Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by PAALP.  At the facility, we receive natural gasoline via railroad tank cars.  The received natural gasoline is stored in three 60,000-gallon pressure vessels.  From these pressure vessels, natural gasoline can be loaded directly into tanker trucks for distribution to customers.\n\nNatural gasoline is a petroleum fraction and as such is an NFPA Class 4 flammable mixture.  The lighter molecular weight components of this fraction include butane, 1-butene, 2-butene, isobutene, pentane, isopentane and pentene.  As an NFPA Class 4 flammable mixture, natural gasoline is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) since the quantity of this material at the Cordova terminal exceeds EPA\u00bfs threshold quantity. There are no toxic substances present at the site. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  \n\nThis terminal is protected by a nitrogen operated pneumatic shutdown system compliant with NFPA 58.  The nitrogen system is plumbed with tubing that if melted in a fire will cause activation of the ESD system. The Emergency Shutdown Valves [ESVs] are forced open with approximately 45 psi of nitrogen. In the event of an emergency, pressing any of the ESD buttons (pneumatic) at the terminal closes the ESVs by dumping the nitrogen pressure that holds them open. There are ESVs installed on the inlets and outlets of each tank, at the truck loading rack and the railcar off-loading arms and associated piping.\n\nEach of the tanks inlets and outlets are equipped with Excess Flow Valves.  If a natural gasoline leak or a piping break occurs downstream of the valve, the valves will close when the gallons per minute settings are exceeded.\n\nIn addition, the only way to hook the off-loading hose to the rail car is by using an ESV adapter, which goes from the pipe fitting to the \u00bfACME\u00bf fitting on the hose.  A nitrogen line must also be attached to the adapte"

In the event that a detector is activated, the detector \u00bftrips\u00bf and closes all of the ESVs.  Dumping the nitrogen pressure out of the ESD system closes the ESVs. The ESD system also interrupts the electrical power to all rotating equipment in the terminal.  Fire eyes are also present in the facility which will trigger alarms and shutdown equipment if activated.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the last five years there have been no chemical release accidents that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage or offsite impacts. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the terminal with the Cordova Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Cordova Police Department, the Rock Island County Emergency Management Agency, and the Rock Island County Emergency Medical Services and, as appropriate, the Illinois State Highway Patrol.
