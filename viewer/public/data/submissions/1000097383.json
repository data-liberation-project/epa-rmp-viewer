      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nMonell CO2, LLC owns and operates the Monell CO2FLEX Plant (CO2FLEX Plant) located in rural Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The CO2FLEX Plant is a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) plant which recovers hydrocarbons in the form of NGLs from a CO2 recycle/reinjection stream that is part of a miscible CO2 flood of an oilfield. Oil and gas production, from the nearby FDL Energy's Monell Unit is treated in FDL's facility, where oil and water are separated from the CO2 gas stream via separators. The gas is then sent to the CO2FLEX Plant for treatment.\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant consists of two processes - NGL Fractionation Area and Product Storage Area. The inlet gas in the plant is processed through a refrigeration process involving temperature change which condenses hydrocarbons, propane +, forming a propane + (Y-Grade) product. The Y-Grade product is stored in a pressurized tank with maximum volume of 5,000 gallons. A Crude Mix product is stored in a 9,000 gallon pressurized tank. \n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes a propane refrigeration system. Propane storage of 10,550 gallons is located onsite and is associated with the refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 10,550 gallon propane tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the CO2FLEX Plant. The 10,550 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles. Public receptors are within a 0.3 mile radius of the propane vessel. The worst case scenario has the potential to affect persons within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. The plant is also subject to OSHA's PSM program. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 3 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant is located in a remote area and is normally occupied by Monell CO2, LLC personnel. There is no accident history, resulting in a release, to report. Should an emergency involving the CO2FLEX Pla"

This policy has been discussed with the local fire chief at Fire District 1 in Rock Springs, Wyoming.\n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 9,000 gallon Crude Mix tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion was modeled as an Alternative-Release scenario for the CO2FLEX Plant. The 9,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles. Public receptors are within a 0.2 mile radius of the crude mix vessel. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, CO2FLEX Plant trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the CO2FLEX Plant, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant maintains an emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: \n\n1. proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, \n\n2. evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and\n\n3. notification of local emergency response agencies \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. This plan will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant. Plant personnel will not respond to a major event that threatens or resu"

The CO2FLEX Plant is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communications capability with the Sweetwater County Fire Department, the Sweetwater County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Sweetwater County Sheriff Department. This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the CO2FLEX Plant. The above referenced processes at the CO2FLEX Plant are regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. Because RMP accident prevention requirements for these processes are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the CO2FLEX Plant.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance procedures. Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment. \n\n\n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the CO2FLEX Plant's accident prevention program.

Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; lockout/tagout, management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant may use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the CO2FLEX Plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors perform their work in a safe manner. These contractor safety procedures include steps to verify that contractors - have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their jobs safely, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and inform facility personnel of any potential hazards that they introduce or find during their work. Contractors working within the CO2FLEX Plant are provided with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency procedure requirements, and site-specific applicable safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the CO2FLEX Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor. CO2FLEX Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Saf"

      "SummaryText": "ety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready. A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. If new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n(1) utilization of appropriately trained maintenance personnel, \n\n(2) developing written procedures, and \n\n(3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies. \n\n\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: \n\n(1) an overview of the process, \n\n(2) safety and health hazards, \n\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n\n(4) emergency procedures, and\n\n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their     jobs in a safe manner. \n\nWritten inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their relative assigned duties.

If a deficiency is identified that presents an immediate safety concern, CO2FLEX Plant personnel will correct the defect before placing the equipment back into service. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant has safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety. Examples of these include: \n\n(1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \n\n(2) a     lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n\n(3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process    piping or equipment is opened, \n\n(4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and \n\n(5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to -\n\n\n\n(1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and \n\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. \n\n\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe CO2FLEX Plant will promptly investigate any incidents related to a co"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to CO2FLEX Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the CO2FLEX Plant will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. Personnel familiar with the facility and Process Safety Management participate in these audits. The audit team will develop findings that are forwarded to CO2FLEX Plant management for resolution.
