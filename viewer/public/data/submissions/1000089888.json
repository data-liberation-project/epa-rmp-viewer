Shasta has instituted a Risk Management Program for their Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68 (chlorine)and CalARP regulations, 19 CCR 2735, (chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of threshold quantities.\n\nIt describes:\n\n?    The structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on offsite public and environmental receptors; \n\n?    The results of an offsite consequences analysis; \n\n?    A prevention program;\n\n?    An emergency response program; \n\n?    Mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; \n\n?    A schedule and responsibilities for implementing mitigation measures; and \n\n?    A means and schedule for auditing program elements.  \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been being filed as required by ARP and CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta operates and maintains a wastewater treatment plant, located above the east bank of the Sacramento River in the City of Mt. Shasta, Siskiyou County, CA.  It uses chlorine, an RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS. It also uses sulfur dioxide, also an RS, for dechlorination in quantities below Federal and above California threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nThere are two full-time employees at this site.  The plant is manned on the day shift Monday through Friday and is checked on the weekends. An alarm company and a SCADA callout system (WIN 911) alert operators to any alarm condition when operators and not onsite.  \n\n\n\nThe RS's "

The chlorine is used for disinfection of wastewater effluent prior to discharge.  The sulfur dioxide is added at the end of the chlorination disinfection process to remove residual chlorine.  The system operates in the following manner: Pressurized chlorine (sulfur dioxide) gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves. It is metered through rotameters, and rate valves automatically set the amount in proportion to flow and desired chlorine residual. Finally, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are drawn into water solutions by the passage of pressurized water through injectors.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Mt. Shasta that the receipt, storage, and handling of RS's at its facility be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  To accomplish this goal, the City has gathered safety information on chlorine (sulfur dioxide) and on the process, equipment, and procedures involving chlorine (sulfur dioxide); and performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process. The City has performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. It has also established a written emergency action program and coordinated with emergency response agencies. The City is a non-responding facility per California General Industrial Safety Order 3220.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City of Mt. Shasta are used to mitigate the severity of the Worst and Alternative Case release scenarios. They include the C"

No passive mitigation was considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the response of properly trained and equipped personnel from the Shasta Cascade HazMat Response Team (SCHMRT) following established emergency response procedures. This team is the response organization for a multi-county area and is based in Redding, CA, with responders in several counties.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Mt. Shasta are categorized as administrative (management) programs, procedures, training, engineering controls, and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA GISO Section 5189 covering the disinfection and dechlorination processes at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The PSM Program constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City's operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures, included in the PSM Program, are used as the Risk Management Program management system.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine (sulfur dioxide) have been identified and implemented.  These include:\n\n?    improvements in operating procedures, \n\n?    installing windsocks, \n\n?    replacing the manual hoist with a motorized trolley, \n\n?    sealing off the doorways connecting the chlorine storage and rotameter rooms from the rest of the Operations Buildi"

Shasta's Emergency Action plan applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Siskiyou County Hazardous Materials Management Group, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination. The emergency response program is coordinated with the seven-county Shasta-Cascade HazMat Response Team (SCHMRT).  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis, which the City of Mt. Shasta committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.  This also includes any recommendations arising from reviewing Chlorine Institute RAGAGEP information. The facility plans construct a new plant at the current site within the next 3-5 years.  It will move from chlorine to ultraviolet disinfection at that time.  This program will be deregistered when that occurs.\n\n"
