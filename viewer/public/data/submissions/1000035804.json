The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.  The facility was constructed and began operations in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of Wonderful Citrus is processing and storage of citrus products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains two refrigeration systems containing a maximum of 22,483 pounds of ammonia, a regulated substance. The DC Cold Storage System contains a maximum of 11,907 pounds of ammonia and the De-Greening System contains a maximum of 10,576 pounds of ammonia. The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and storage of citrus products.  Typical operating conditions range from: \r\n\u00bfDC Cold Storage System: approximately 39 psig on the low"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.  To save lives.\r\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted on July 30-31, 2013, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Wonderful Citrus facility.  The Wonderful Citrus safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue t"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 2010 International Mechanical Code, ANSI/IIAR 2 - 2008, and ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15 - 2010, which specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine rooms as well as sensors in the cold rooms.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just outside of the engine rooms (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to an ammonia diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Wonderful Citrus has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration systems at Wonderful Citrus is of new construction at the time the PSM/RMP documentation was submitted (August 2013).  Facility start up is scheduled for August 2013.  Therefore, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the past five years.  In addition, there have been no injuries"
