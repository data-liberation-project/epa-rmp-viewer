This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Fairway Facility is located at 260 FM 3153 near San Augustine, Texas in San Augustine County at the global position of 31.50710\u00ba N and -94.3423\u00ba W.   \r\nThe facility operates a refrigeration process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from oil and gas wells. Regulated flammables handled at the Fairway Gas Plant include methane, ethane, propane and butane.  Enterprise Products purchased the facility from Azure Midstream and assumed control of the Fairway Facility on May 1, 2017.\r\nDue to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Fairway Facility is registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site, but no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the safety and accident prevention program in place at the Fairway Facility.  The gas processing operations at the Fairway Facility are regu"

This summary addresses describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Fairway Facility has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Fairway Facility will promptly investigate any incidents that result in or reasonably could result in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develop recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forward these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Fairway Facility has safety features and controls to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* The operators are observant for anything that may create a leak.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Process relief valves that disc"

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Fairway Facility is coordinated with the San Augustine County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). The Fairway Facility has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to pe"
