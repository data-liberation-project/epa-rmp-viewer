Facility Policy\r\nThe management and employees of the Ottawa Cooperative Association are committed\r\nto the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If any release\r\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and or other \r\nauthorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the \r\nenvironment.\r\n2. Facility Information\r\nOur plant consists of three NH3 storage vessels. Our maximum inventory report is located\r\nin our compliance manuals. We have also shared this quantity with our local first\r\nresponders to help them in planning and training.\r\n3. Worst case scenario and alternate release scenario\r\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared \r\nwith our local first responders as part of an on going training program. More\r\nimportantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions,\r\nincluding the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities\r\nregarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n4. Accidental release program\r\nThe facility strives to comply with the provisions of the US occupational safety and\r\n health administration (OSHA), 29 cfr, 1910.111 \"storage and handling of anhydrous\r\nammonia\".  This facility is also in compliance with the provisions of the Kansas\r\nfertilizer law.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the rmp registration form in\r\nsection 8.3 b.\r\nThere are many hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia. We require that each \r\nemployee that loads ammonia be trained every three years at a state sponsored\r\ntraining school and yearly trained in operating and safety procedures at a given\r\nammonia plant. All employees are trained to inspect the ammonia plant before\r\nfilling procedures and before use do a visual inspection of all hoses and valves to\r\nmake sure there has not been a failure of equipment since the last time it was used.\r\nEmployees are reminded to follo"

Five year accident history\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that have caused deaths,\r\ninjury, or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge has there been\r\nany accidental releases resulting in off site death, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or \r\nenvironmental damage.\r\n6. Emergency action plan\r\nA. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910-38\r\nB. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and\r\ncommunity right to know information as required under SARA Title II.\r\nC. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required\r\nresponse action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable\r\nemergency response numbers. \r\n1. Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of release would be over 100 pounds\r\nthe emergency coordinator will notify the National Response Center (800-424-8802).\r\n2. Within 24 hours of determining the amount of release would affect the environment\r\nthe emergency coordinator will notify the Kansas Bureau of Environmental \r\nRemediation (785-296-1679) or after normal business hours (785-296-0614) and \r\nKansas Department of Emergency Management (785-296-3176) and in all cases the\r\nKansas Department of Agriculture (785-296-3301).\r\n7.
