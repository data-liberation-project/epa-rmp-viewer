The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Harrison Hub Complex (HHC) is to fractionate natural gas liquids (NGLs) into marketable components including ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline.  The NGLs are delivered to the HHC through an inlet Surge Vessel and then pumped through the fractionation process which includes a De-Ethanizer Tower, De-Propanizer Tower and De-Butanizer Tower.  Overheads from the De-Ethanizer consist primarily of ethane and are pumped into an ethane pipeline that transports the ethane to a main product pipeline that is operated by a 3rd party.  The bottoms from the De-Ethanizer are routed to the De-Propanizer.  Overheads from the De-Propanizer consist primarily of propane and are pumped into horizontal storage vessels in the Tank Farm that are located outside the processing area.  Propane is also transported via a pipeline that delivers the propane to a product pipeline that is operated by a third party.  Bottoms from the De-Propanizer are routed to the De-Butanizer and associated process equipment.  Overheads from the De-Butanizer consist mainly of mixed butanes and are pumped into horizontal storage vessels in the Tank Farm or to a 50,000 bbl Butane Sphere.  Bottoms from the De-Butanizer are recovered as Natural Gasoline and are routed to either the 750 BBL Natura"

All products are routed to a Rail Loading Facility for transport.  A Truck Loading Rack is also available for Propane.  \n\n  \n\nOther major equipment at the Plant includes a Hot Oil Heater that provides a heat medium which is used for recovering the various products in the Fractionation Process.  This is the only major piece of equipment that utilizes natural gas.  All other major equipment including pumps and motors utilize electricity. \n\n \n\nAs a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the Plant at any given time. \n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the Harrison Hub Complex NGL Fractionation covered process and according to 40 CFR ?68.3 Definitions - Stationary Source, the 2019 RMP Submittal will incorporate the five previous processes which included: Butane Storage, Propane Storage, Natural Gasoline Storage, NGL Fractionation Trains, and Butane Sphere into a single covered process.    \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at the HHC.  The HHC has been classified as a Program 3 because public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.  The Plant is manned 24 hours a day/seven days a week by Operation Personnel who receive extensive Environmental, Health & Safety Training.  Over pressure and high level alarms are in place with shutdown controls for abnormal conditions.  System volumes and pressures are monitored through a Distributed Control System (DCS) with an operator stationed at the Control Room for monitoring of systems and alarms.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe HHC started operations on August 10, 2013 and"
