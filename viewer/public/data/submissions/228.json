THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n      THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CENTRAL CO-OP ARE COMMITTED TO\nTHE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n      IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH \nTHE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE\nTHE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS\nFOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n      ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRUDUCTION NUTRIENTS. \n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 520,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO\n26,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS AND SIXTY-TWO NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY\nHANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n       3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERANATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n  A. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE \nOF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.\n  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 120,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE\nVOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.09 MILES.\n\n         B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD\nREVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT\n(POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n        4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE\nSTORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN\nNATIONAL STANDARDS INST"
