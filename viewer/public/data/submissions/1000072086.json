Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: storage tank, piping systems, bulk tank truck, relief and vent systems, and nitrogen blanket. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \r\n- Compliance audits: Facility conducts audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 11/12/2018. Actions required as result of the audits are undertaken in safe and prompt manner. \r\n- Incident Investigation: Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps \r\nEpichlorohydrin storage tank is located in a diked contained area to contain any spills and prevent any vehicles or forklifts collisions. A nitrogen blanket is used for the storage tank to ensure the tank contents remain at less than 8 percent oxygen.  The storage tank will be equipped with level measurement, alarms and shutdown of unloading pumps to avoid overfilling. \r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThe facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of all covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\nFacility emergency response plan includes immediately evacuating facility of"
