      "SummaryText": "This Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan has been prepared for the Frankfort Utility Board for the City of Frankfort?s Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located at 45 West County Road 100 North in Frankfort, Clinton County, Indiana.  For report purposes, the WWTP will hereafter be referred to as Facility.\n\nThe Facility currently stores chlorine used in their process at a rate above EPA RMP  threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The facility has 13 full time employees.  In addition, the facility hires 2 seasonal employees during the summer months.  At least one operator staffs the site 24-hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nThe chlorine gas withdrawal system (hereafter referred to as process) is used for disinfection of the plant effluent or tertiary filter influent or filtered water storage.  The process including all chlorine storage, occurs in the chlorine room.  The process consists of the following equipment:\n\n?    1-ton Liquid Chlorine Containers;\n?    Two 1-ton Container Weight Scale and Container Rack;\n?    Overhead Hoist Equipment;\n?    Two Vacuum Regulators;\n?    Automatic Switchover Unit;\n?    Three Flow Proportioners;\n?    Three Injectors; and\n?    Process Piping.\n\nChlorine dosage relative to flow, is controlled by the flow proportioners and injectors.  Each proportioner is controlled by a signal from the flow metering equipment at the effluent end of the chlorine contact chamber.  Water flowing across the injector creates a partial vacuum that activates the diaphragm valve in the vacuum regulator.  Chlorine gas is introduced into the system at the injector and carried on to the point of application.  The normal point of chlorine application will be at the chlorine contact tank.\n\nPlant effluent chlorination is required on a seasonal basis with the chlorine residual not to exceed 0.05 milligrams per liter (mg/L) at the point of discharge.   Chlorine application at the tertiary filter influent or the filtered water storage tank, used to control bacterial activity, may be accomplished "

      "SummaryText": "independent of the effluent chlorination.\n\nThe Frankfort Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?    Training of the operators\n\n?    Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\n\n?    Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n?    Implementation of a hazard review and inspection program\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, ventilation and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated by the Clinton County Volunteer Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Commission.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nSeveral changes to improve safety were identified when the Risk Management Prevention Program was completed for the facility.  These recommended actions will be implemented."
