ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE.\nThis facility complies with OSHA 1910.38 and EPCRA requirements for Nh3 storage and it is our policy to\nadhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to\nnotify the Klemme Fire Dept. and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n 2. DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE.\nThis facility is a Coop, handeling grain and commercial fertilizers.  We sell Nh3 to our patrons as a service.\nThere are two 26,000 gallon Nh3 bulk storage tanks (cap.max. 226300 lbs.) and its associated piping, pumps, and valves. We also have 54 nurse tanks which hold a maximum capacity of 235000 lbs. Total maximum capacity for this facility is 461300 lbs.\n\n 3. WORST CASE SCENARIO.\nOur worst case scenario is a failure of one of our 26,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest\namount allowed (85%), resulting in a toxic gas release.  According to EPA's RMP COMP. the distance to the\nendpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are residences, public areas, schools, and offices within the distance  endpoint, with a total population of 1127 people.\n\n 4. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our Nh3 system, it is our policy to notify the Klemme Fire Dept.\nMembers of the Fire Dept. have walked through our facility.\n \n 5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nWe have never had an accident involving Nh3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental\ndamage or evacuations.\n\n 6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintinance of safe conditions.  No changes planned."
