The Company?s manufacturing facility at 799 Route 206 in Belle Mead, New Jersey produces many of these products and has been in operation for nearly 38 years. \n\nWe're proud of what we do\n\nWe produce high quality products at the Belle Mead facility that are preferred by millions of consumers to: clean and disinfect surfaces throughout the home, freshen the air, clean the oven, take care of carpets, polish furniture and help maintain an overall healthy home environment.\n \nWe care\n\nThe Belle Mead team, which consists of approximately 200 men and women, works with an emphasis on safety, quality and quantity -- in that order. We accomplish our goals through a commitment to teamwork and are continually re-certified in the renowned International Organization of Standardization for Quality Management Systems (ISO 9002).  Attainment of the certification entails meeting a comprehensive set of guidelines for areas that affect quality such as production, planning and process controls, and required team members to undergo thousands of hours of training. \n\nWe work hard on preserving the environment, protecting health and ensuring safety\n\nWe take seriously our commitment to the environment and design products, processes and packaging to minimize waste through reuse and recycling and ensure materials are safe for disposal. We also spend many hours internally on developing safety procedures, conducting drills, and training personnel.  Externally, we coordinate efforts with local emergency responders to ensure safety and proper preparedness.\n\nWe are stakeholders in our community\n\nMany employees and their families live, work, and go to school here.  We take pride in contributing to community programs and services, including, among others, our Community Advisory Panel, annual Earth Day efforts and the yearly United Way campaign, in which the Company matches em"

These regulations, also known as the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule), were promulgated pursuant to Section 112(r)(7) of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Air Act Amendments. Industrial facilities must comply with the RMP Rule if they handle, manufacture, or use certain toxic or flammable substances in a quantity greater than specified threshold quantities in a process.  A list of regulated toxic and flammable substances and their individual threshold quantities is located in Section 68.130 of the RMP Rule.

The Belle Mead facility is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule due to the type and amount of regulated flammable substances stored in vessels in a storage tank farm referred to as the ISO Farm (abbreviation for Isobutane stored in an area also known as the ?Propellant Storage and Distribution Process?).  The ISO Farm qualifies as Program Level 3 under the RMP Rule.  The Belle Mead facility has prepared and implemented a Risk Management Program for the ISO Farm in accordance with Program Level 3 requirements and has submitted a Risk Management Plan to the EPA in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.150 (Risk Management Plan - - Submission).\n\nThis Executive Summary is required under 40 CFR Part 68.155.  The intention of this Executive Summary is to provide general information to the EPA, employees of Reckitt Benckiser, and the local community about the regulated flammable substances stored and handled at the Belle Mead facility and the facility?s accidental release prevention program and emergency response policies associated with the ISO Farm. Additionally, it reports on the five-year accident history of the Belle Mead facility, as it pertains to the flammable substances stored in the ISO Farm. \n\nFor the purposes of this Executive Summary and for the facility's Risk Management Program and Plan, the substances, equipment and procedures of focus are the regulated flammable substances, equipment, and procedures associated with the ISO Farm only. This area encompasses the ISO Farm, unloading area, and process piping entering the aerosol propellant gassing operation at the gashouse.\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances\nThe Belle Mead facility does not handle, manufacture or use any toxic substances over the regulatory threshold.  Reckitt Benckiser does use blends of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and difluoroethane in the aerosol propellant gassing operation at t"

      "SummaryText": "he Belle Mead facility.  Difluoroethane is a flammable substance and is regulated under the NJDEP TCPA program and RMP Rule if handled, manufactured or stored in a process at a facility in a quantity greater than its listed threshold quantity.  The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Programs\nReckitt Benckiser places great importance on the implementation of procedures for responding to and, more importantly, preventing accidental releases of chemicals that have the potential to harm human health or the environment.  \nAt Reckitt Benckiser, we have adopted a rigorous approach to ensuring that hazardous chemicals and flammable liquids are used and stored safely.  One element of that approach is a thorough risk assessment, a formal and exhaustive analysis of chemical processes used to identify and address process hazards.  Risk assessments are conducted on a periodic basis for existing processes and immediately before the final design stage of new or modified processes.\n\nIn a typical risk assessment, team members from a variety of disciplines - engineers, team leaders, plant operators, and maintenance technicians - gather to analyze a chemical process. Every component of the process - pumps, piping, storage tanks, instruments, valves, controls, and safety devices - as well as operating and maintenance practices are evaluated to determine possible causes of failure. Each cause is then reviewed to ensure that one or more levels of safety protection are available in the event a failure occurs. \n\nThe use of risk assessment by analyzing process hazards became universal with the introduction of OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation in 1993. Although this regulation applies only to certain flammable liquids used at the Belle Mead facility, we recognize the importance and benefits of risk assessment to all our operations and have applied it to other processes tha"

In an effort to enhance the effectiveness and organization of the several accidental release prevention programs and emergency response programs maintained at the Belle Mead facility, Reckitt Benckiser has recently prepared an Integrated Contingency Plan in compliance with the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan.  This plan also provides guidance to include local emergency responders such as police, fire, and rescue as appropriate.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nFacilities subject to the RMP Rule are also required to report accidents and releases occurring in the last five years in which exposure to a regulated flammable substance, overpressure generated by an explosion of the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to death, injury, or response or restoration activities at an environmental receptor on-site or off-site.  Reckitt Benckiser certifies in the RMP submission to the EPA that during the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred involving regulated flammable substances from the ISO Farm according to the EPA's criteria.  \n\nConclusion\nThe safety and control systems on the equipment in and associated with the ISO Farm are state-of-the-art and represent the highest degree of safety and accident prevention currently available for unloading, storage, and distribution of flammable substances.  We also meet and exceed National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 58) standards for the LPG.  As a responsible corporate citizen a"
