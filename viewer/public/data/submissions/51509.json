(Nufarm) is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  Nufarm coordinates all of the emergency response activities with the Cook County LEPC and Chicago Heights Fire Department.\n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nNufarm manufactures water-based herbicides using dimethylamine (DMA), ispropylamine (IPA), and 28% ammonia.  The manufacturing process consists of one main process area where the herbicides are produced and designated DMA , IPA and ammonia tanks.  The herbicide process is a batch process.  Both DMA and IPA are regulated flammable substances.  The DMA is stored as a 60% (by weight) aqueous solution.  The IPA is stored as a 70% IPA aqueous solution. \n\nNufarm has implemented programs to comply with the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps as required by EPA.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nNufarm maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of the regulated substances, the technology of the processes, and the equipment in the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nNufarm has performed process hazard analyses for the DMA, IPA, and ammonia covered processes.  These PHAs comply with 40 CFR 68.67.  The Nufarm site utilizes the What-If methodology to identify the hazards of the processes, to consider consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls, and to evaluate safety and health effects of possible releases of regulated substances.   \n\nOperating Procedures:\nNufarm has written operating procedures that provide instruction for safely operating covered processes.  These operating procedures are available to employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed annually and modified when needed to accommodate operational and p"

Training documentation provides records of when training was received and whether or not the training was understood.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nNufarm has a preventive maintenance program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  Maintenance employees receive training for maintenance activities.  Periodic inspection and testing are performed on process equipment and records are kept to document this inspection and testing.\n\nManagement of Change:\nNufarm has a written procedure to document and manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Employees are notified of and provided training for changes to the process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:\nNufarm performs pre-statup safety reviews for changes in a process that require modification to process safety information.\n\nCompliance Audit:\nNufarm will evaluate compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 every three years.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nNufarm conducts an incident investigation for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nNufarm has a written employee participation plan that allows input from employees on the development and analysis of process safety management.  PHAs and all other RMP information are available to employees.\n\nHot Work Permit:\nNufarm has a procedure for the issuance of hot work permits for hot work done on covered processes.\n\nContractors:\nNufarm hires contractors to perform maintenance and various other activities at their facility.  Nufarm reviews contractors' safety performance and programs and informs contractors of known potential hazards related to working at their site.  Nufarm maintains a program to control the entrance, presence, and exit from covered process areas.  Contractor performance is evaluated annually.\n\n5-Year "

      "SummaryText": "Accident History:\nNo accidental release has occurred at the Nufarm Chicago Heights, IL facility that qualifies for the 5-year accident history.  Information on this accidental release is contained in Section 6 of the RM Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nNufarm has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan which includes information for notifying offsite emergency responders of releases of DMA, IPA, and ammonia.  Nufarm relies on the Chicago Heights Fire Department for responding to DMA, IPA, and ammonia releases and fires.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nAt this time, no changes are planned to enhance the safety of the Nufarm facility.  However, an on-going commitment to implement changes when identified that will improve the safety of the employes and neighbors exists."
