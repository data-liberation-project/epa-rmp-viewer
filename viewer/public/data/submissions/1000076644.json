This facility started batch manufacturing at the Camanche, IA location in 1989.    \r\n\r\nThe Camanche facility is sited distant from residential population, in an industrial area with space, fences, security, natural obstacles separating the areas from casual public.  A perimeter fence with guard service is located around the facility to keep the public out.  Vertex shares security and perimeter fencing with another manufacturing company, Clysar.  Secondary security fencing is located around the chlorine railcar unloading area to keep unauthorized personnel away from the chlorine unloading area.  Batch process is set up as close as possible to the chlorine railcars to reduce pipeline distance which reduces the hazard of mechanical failure and how much chlorine would be released in a pipeline failure.\r\n\r\nPrevention and Emergency Response policies:  Hawkins' management and safety committees have set a motto of \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\" regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\r\n1. A corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\r\n2. Training programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\r\n3. Prompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\r\n4. Adherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\r\n5. Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\r\n6. Internal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\r\n7. Members in good standing with the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a chemical distribution and manufacturing faci"

This site manufactures sodium hypochlorite (also known as bleach).  Chlorine is part of this manufacturing process.  Chlorine is the only chemical covered by Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan for this facility.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chlorine during receipt, storage and use.  This starts with DOT FRA approved 90-ton railcars that are robustly designed to contain chlorine through expected conditions during transport, storage and unloading.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely transfer chemicals during manufacture.  \r\n\r\nHawkins accident prevention program includes:\r\n1. Procedures and training for handling chlorine during manufacturing of sodium hypochlorite;\r\n2. Implement safety systems to manage risks identified during process hazard analysis;\r\n3. Conduct necessary plant maintenance and inspections to ensure equipment is in good working order;\r\n4. Vendor provided DOT approved railcars;\r\n5. Adhere to OSHA workplace safety regulations;\r\n6. Follow Chlorine Institute standards.\r\n7. Members in good standings with National Association of Chemical Distributors\r\n\r\n5-year Accident History:  There has not been an accident involving chlorine at this facility in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a maintenance issue with chlorine equipment/railcar, employees are trained on how to detect the source of the issue and take appropriate action such as closing or tightening a valve.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility has a trained on-site hazmat team including proper equipment (SCBA and C-kits) to respond.
