We produce turkey, pork and chicken deli meats. The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, two ammonia refrigeration engine rooms, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains anhydrous ammonia in a quantity greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case scenarios were calculated for this Risk Management Plan.  A Worst Case Scenario was used with a liquid release totaling roughly 12,000 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of 3.5 miles. An Alternate Case Scenario was used with a vapor release totaling roughly 690 pounds over ten minutes with a release radius of .74 miles.\n\nCooper Farms has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual pro"

The facility incorporates two standard evaporation and compression closed loop ammonia refrigeration systems. One system is installed to operate as a two-temperature single stage system. The compressors are split as High Stage and Low Stage Compressors. There exists, two different levels of saturated suction temperatures. Each level of suction temperature services a specific area of the plant. The second system controls the slicing addition which was constructed in 2010 and the newly added tunnel freezer (added in 2019). The second system is also two-temperature single stage system.\n\nSummary of the Five-Year Accident History\nCooper Farms has had no reportable accident(s) in the past five years involving ammonia, while there may have been nuisance odors that cause an incident investigation.\n\nDescription of the Emergency Response Plan\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify a member of management, who will immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC).\n\nIn the event that the ERC is unreachable, an Alternate should be contacted. The ERC or Alternate has complete authority to commit all available resources in the event of an emergency. In the event that none of the listed personnel are on-site, the senior management person shall direct operations until the ERC or Alternate arrives on-site.\n\nThe ERC and alternates are responsible for emergency response coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis. Upon notification of an existing, or imminent emergency situation, the ERC will immediately identify the character, exact source, amount and extent (area) of the emergency.\nThe ERC will assess possible hazards both direct and indirect to human health, the environment and/or property both inside and outside"
