The Corporate Compliance Team assists the facility in administering safety and environmental policies. The Corporate Compliance Team is made up of the following personnel:\n\n\n\n?    Senior Director of Corporate Refrigeration\n\n?    Corporate Manager of Refrigeration\n\n?    Senior Manager Environmental Compliance\n\n?    PSM-RMP Regulatory Manager\n\n?    Corporate Manager of Facilities Compliance\n\n?    OSHA Regulatory Manager\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance Manager periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nC&S - Aberdeen is located at 1000 Old Philadelphia Road in Aberdeen, Maryland, which is approximately 1 ? miles south-east of the I-95.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.\n\nThe primary business of C&S - Aberdeen is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 52,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, dock operations, cold and freezer storage.  Typical operating conditions range from 5\" Hg on the low pressure sid"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S - Aberdeen to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Aberdeen's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within t"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the freezer warehouse that will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection in those locations.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Technicians.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been two reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years, one in 2012 and one in 2013. Details of these incidents are included in Section 6 of the RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. The Facility is non-responding and has personnel trained to support the HazMat response team if required (up to 300 ppm of ammonia).\n\n\n\nThere is a specific program (CEHS-0042) which outlines the training, qualifications and procedures for authorized ammonia Incident responders and observers.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn April 1999, the refrigeration system was thoroughly exam"
