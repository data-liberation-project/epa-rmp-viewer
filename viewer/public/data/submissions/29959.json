The program is based on program level 3 of EPA's RMP regulations and OSHA's PSM regulations. The most noteworthy portions include the Preventive Maintenance Program that Alpenrose use's to maintain our mechanical equipment. Also we have our employee's attend an 8 hour ammonia safety training class annually, sponsored by our local refrigeration company and it is put on by ASTI. ASTI is the Ammonia Safety Training Institute located is Watsonville California. The refigeration system is monitored by a computer 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The computer makes operating decisions based on set point parameters. The system is capable of shutting down if the system was to operate outside of the recommended parameters. The system can also notify first responders if an event should happen involving a release. We have also coordinated with local Emergency Response officials to design a plan in case of a release. We conduct emergency response drills with our local fire department. 2.  Stationary Source and Substances Handled. Alpenrose Dairy has been in business since 1916. Alpenrose is a family owned and operated business committed to processsing and manufacturing quality dairy products for Oregon and Washingto states. This facility uses ammonia in our refrigeration system. We have up to date refrigeration equipment and we use an Oregon licensed refrigeration contractor to maintain our equipment besides our own inside maintenance staff. The only RMP regulated chemical onsite is ammonia. All other on-site chemicals do not meet the criteria for RMP or PSM. Manufacturing operations of dairy products are conducted indoors and the use of ammonia in our refrigeration process is also mostly indoors with a few exceptions such as our condensers and HVAC equipment. 3.  General accidental release prevention program. Alpenrose Dairy has many safeguards in "

      "SummaryText": "place to prevent an accidental off-site release of ammonia. The most significant is that most of our equipment is located indoors. This gives us the ability to contain a release and to mitigate a release and minimize the off-site impact. In addition to having most equipment indoors we have a proactive mainteenance program that allows us to safely repair equipment prior to having a failure in most cases. Alpenrose has installed sensors throughout the dairy to detect a release and to automatically notify the appropriate people when needed. In addition to these proactive programs we also drill with the local fire department on a regular basis. Some of our engineers have received training from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration. Finally Alpenrose Dairy complies with OSHA PSM and the EPA's RMP Program level 3 prevention Programs. 4.  5 year accident history. In the past 5 years Alpenrose has not had a reportable accident involving ammonia. We have not had any injuries involving ammonia in the past 5 years either. 5.  Emergency Respose Program.  Alpenrose Dairy not only trains it's own personnel for emergency response but also trains with local first responders. We have on-site personnel that are knowledgeable in ammonia theory and also have practical knowledge in responding to an incident and we also have contractors on call."
