Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nNational Fuel Gas recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the Heath Compressor Station.\r\n\r\nOne of the undertakings aimed at meeting this responsibility has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of flammable substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n B.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n! Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also included when a"

Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes MSDSs and a description of the design of the Heath Compressor Station.\r\n\r\n! Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the HAZOP technique have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\r\n\r\n! Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the Heath Compressor Station.\r\n\r\n! Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the Heath Compressor Station.\r\n\r\n! Contractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the Heath Compressor Station.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\r\n\r\n! Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is planned for all new projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training is performed, and construction is  completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\r\n\r\n! Mechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the Heath Compressor Station process and equipment are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\r\n\r\n! Hot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\r\n\r\n! Management of Change: The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the Heath Compressor Station are properly reviewed.\r\n\r\n!
