This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant, located eleven miles east of Tarzan Texas on Texas Highway 349, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas and condensate) from natural gas. The Yellow Rose Gas Plant has two regulated flammables, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Yellow Rose Gas Plant. Processes at the Yellow Rose Gas Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of Process Safety Management and Accident Prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention pr"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in materials safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the PSM operating procedures. \r\nThe gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

      "SummaryText": ", each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique and checklist to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering experience. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team suggests possible additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\r\nThese suggestions are forwarded to local and corporate management for review and further processing. The implementation of approved options is based on a relative risk ranking. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each suggestion is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will comply with OSHA 40 CFR 1910. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training o"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\nIn addition, the Yellow Rose Gas Plant maintains a Consequences of Deviation Section of the Plant Operating Manual that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Yellow Rose Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Yellow Rose Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performances during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, appropriate corrective actions will be taken before placing the equipment back into service. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program requires a management of change (MOC) team to review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Yellow Rose Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure tha"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\nIncident Investigation \r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, a forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident prevention program is functioning properly, the Yellow Rose Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe processes at the Yellow Rose Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Yellow Rose Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\nRelease Detection -Personal H2S detectors with alarms\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n-Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episode release \r\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n-Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n-Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n-Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supp"

There has been a decreasing trend in the frequency of accidental releases. Every incident is investigated to determine the cause and prevent recurrence. None of the incidents were associated with the regulated substances of the covered process.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers, the public, and the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedure as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Yellow Rose Gas Plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency response p"

      "SummaryText": "rogram for the Yellow Rose Gas Plant is coordinated with the Martin County local emergency planning committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Yellow Rose Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organization (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident and facilitate a quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Yellow Rose Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involves the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the gas plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Yellow Rose Gas Plant is planning the following types of changes over the next few years in response to RMP, PSM, and incident investigation findings:\r\nStaff is involved in Monthly safety meeting.\r\nStaff is involved with and made aware of any MOC, PHA, and PSSR, changes at the facility."
