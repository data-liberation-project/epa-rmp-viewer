These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and\n\nresponse procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure\n\nworker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs.\n\nThis is the same type of ammonia commonly injected into fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired temperatures in\n\ncoolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a\n\ngas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors,\n\ncondensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing EPA's online version of RMP comp and the population data is based upon information pulled from Marplot. How to determine the WCS & ARS was derived from the EPA document, Risk Management Program guidance for offsite consequences of analysis (1999). \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system,\n\nincluded are high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated\n\nshutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system\n\nbefore shutdowns occur.\n\n\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents associated\n\nwith the ammonia refrigeration system.

      "FacilityID": 1000039783,
      "SummaryText": "blic regarding an ammonia\n\nrelease, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police\n\ndepartment will notify residents and business locations.\n\n\n\nThis facility has had two releases of Ammonia in excess of 100 pounds within the past 5 years. Both of these releases were reported to the EPA timely. The latter release did not meet the criteria for updating the 5 Year accident section as there wasn't any: Significant damage onsite, no off site impact, no injuries, or no  deaths. However, with a preponderance of caution we felt it prudent to add it to our RMP. The former event was a fire that was caused by 2 non-employees (one of which was a Marine on leave) that fired a military flare that landed on our roof and quickly caught the wooden structure on fire. The resulting fire caused a release of ammonia by damaging our refrigeration equipment.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical\n\nIntegrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure\n\nmitigation and control of potential incidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during the Process\n\nHazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity inspections to\n\nimprove the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and implemented in a\n\ntimely manner.\n\n"
