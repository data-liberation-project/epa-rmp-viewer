The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Ammonia Plant in Laddonia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Laddonia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. This plan is being updated to include an additional 18,000 gallon storage tank located on property immediately east of the former location. This facility will be known as the East Anhydrous Ammonia facility.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored in our bulk tanks would be 224,314 pounds. The largest single tanks quantity would be 84,118 pounds in either of our 18,000 gallon storage tanks. The former location also has two 6,000 gallon storage tanks at the facility. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  The facility has fifty-seven 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and three tank applicators, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 478,569 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of either of the 18,000 gallon storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 84,118 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.9 miles.\nb. The alternative release scenario based on t"

      "SummaryText": "he most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n    1/8/03"
