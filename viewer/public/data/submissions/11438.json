WRMWD personnel will not attempt to stop a major chlorine leak.  However, procedures have been established for notifying the Fire Department, Sheriff's Department, and Emergency Medical Services (if needed).  Procedures have also been established for notifying all persons within 1/2 mile of the WTP concerning a major chlorine leak.  Depending on the severity of the leak and prevailing wind conditions, people will be advised to either move immediately upwind of the leak or to remain indoors with windows closed and air conditioners and ventilation systems turned off.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION/REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe WRMWD is a 4.5 MGD water treatment facility which provides treated water to the Cities of Crosbyton, Post, Ralls, and Spur, Texas.  Both chlorine and propane are handled at the WTP.  However, only chlorine is stored in quantities subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scen"

Using the American Water Works Association Research Foundation's (AWWARF) Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants results in a worst-case distance to toxic endpoint of 3.10 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a valve or pipe failure resulting in a 5/16-inch diameter opening.  Using the above-mentioned AWWARF Guidance Document, a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, a \"D\" stability class, and rural topography resulted in a 0.57 mile distance  to the toxic endpoint for chlorine.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis was summarized above under Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents subject to reporting under 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis was summarized above under Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs a result of the initial process hazard review conducted as part of this RMP, a number of changes are planned to improve safety.  The most significant of these changes include:\n\n     1.     Replacing exisiting chlorine feed system with a vacuum feed system;\n     2.     Installation of a windsock in a visible location;\n     3.     Purchase of chlorine leak detector; and\n     4.     Requiring escape-type breathing units to be worn by two operators when changing chlorine\n             containers."
