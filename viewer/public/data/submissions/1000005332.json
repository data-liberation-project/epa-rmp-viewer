Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nOXY USA WTP LP (Oxy) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Oxy's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to effectively control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nII.    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Indian Basin Gas Plant (IBGP), located in Eddy County, New Mexico, extracts natural-gas liquids from natural gas, manufactures sweet residue gas for sales, and manufactures sweet fuel gas for plant and field consumption.  The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68. \n\nIII.    Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the IBGP is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank.  This scenario involves a release of  320,000 lbs of a hydrocarbon mixture consisting of 160,000 pounds of ethane, 64,000 pounds of propane, 64,000 pounds of butane, and 32,000 pounds of pentane.  This inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.55 miles.  Although there are numerous controls at the IBGP to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating thi"

      "SummaryText": "s WCS.\n\nIV.    General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe accident prevention program in place at the IBGP is summarized in the following.  Because this facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n    A.    Employee Participation\n\n    Oxy ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include compiling and updating technical documents, chemical information and operating procedures; participating in and providing suggestions on the emergency response drills; and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, an incident investigation team, or an audit team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\n    B.    Process Safety Information\n\n    Oxy personnel maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.  Specific personnel within the gas plant and at the Midland Region office are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A PSM information reference form is utilized to document the location of this information.\n\n    Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  Documents maintained on file include process flow diagrams, a description of the process, the maximum intended inventory, saf"

Trained Oxy operating personnel ensure that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    Technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment are also maintained.  This information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design, design codes and standards, and safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection and suppression systems).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities. \n\n    All changes to the process chemicals, technology or equipment are subject to the Management of Change program (Item J below) to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n"
