(WSI), is in the business of \npower production and uses anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstract Service [CAS] #7664-41-7); a \nregulated substance.  This RMP document has been prepared in accordance with the California \nAccidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Guidance Document dated June 8, 2004 (California \nCode of Regulations [CCR], Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5).\n\nThe WPP plant will process and store ammonia in quantities above the Federal and State \nregulatory threshold quantities and therefore, is submitting this RMP.  A Program 3 RMP \nis being submitted due to the proximity of the facility to off site receptors.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWSI has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is used to respond to emergency situations.  \nThe plan consists of reporting and notification, mitigation, evacuation, emergency response \nassistance, and medical assistance procedures.  These procedures are discussed in detail in \nSection 7 of this report.\n\n1.2 The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activity at the WPP facility is to generate electricity for sale.  The facility is \nlocated in a rural part of southwestern Fresno County and consists of a 49.9 megawatt (MW) \npeaking power plant.  The plant is driven by two 25 MW Pratt & Whitney stationary combustion \ngas turbine (CGT).  The units exhaust to a common exhaust train equipped with a Selective \nCatalytic Reduction (SCR) system, which controls emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) using \nammonia (NH3) as a reagent.  The ammonia is stored onsite in two aboveground pre"

The maximum weight of \nanhydrous ammonia on the site is 8,840 lbs (i.e., 4,420 lbs per vessel).\n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nWSI is dedicated to operating a safe facility.  WSI employees are trained in every aspect of \nhazardous materials management, from using personal protective equipment (PPE) to performing \nmaintenance on facility equipment.  All employees are trained in emergency evacuation \nprocedures.  A written program for maintaining and inspecting the ongoing integrity of all \nregulated substance process equipment ensures that equipment receives appropriate, regularly \nscheduled maintenance.  Regular inspections are performed to identify the condition and \nreliability of each piece of equipment.  Maintenance on tanks containing ammonia is performed \nmonthly (unless otherwise stated) and consists of visual inspection and preventive maintenance \nactivities.  General tank condition is inspected and maintenance performed when deemed \nnecessary.  Changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures will be \nimplemented when necessary.  Before a process change occurs, management of change protocol \nwill be implemented to ensure a safe and smooth transition.\n\nWSI will perform a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for the new ammonia tank and for any \nmodification significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The \npre-startup safety review shall confirm that, prior to the introduction of regulated \nsubstances, the process conforms to all specified regulations and safety requirements.\n\nWSI shall also report any events that may lead to impacts onsite or offsite, regardless of \nwhether or not an actual impact does occur, according to the incident investigation program \ncontained herein.\n\n1.4 Fi"

      "SummaryText": "ve-year Accident History\n\nThe WPP facility commenced operations in December 2001.  Between December 2001 and April 2005, \nthe facility utilizes aqueous ammonia as the SCR reagent.  During that period, there were no \naccidental releases of aqueous ammonia that resulted in death, injury, or significant property \ndamage on site, or known offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property \ndamage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe introduction of anhydrous ammonia is a new process and will replace the process of aqueous \nammonia. There have not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia within the last five \nyears that resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or known offsite \ndeath, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n1.5 Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario assumes a rupture of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, \nresulting in a constant release of the entire contents into the air for a duration of 10 \nminutes.  This scenario results in the toxic endpoint distance of 1.7 miles from the tanks.  \nThe alternative release scenario, which is considered a more plausible event, assumes a \nrelease of about 100 gallons into the air for a duration of 1 minute.  The alternative release \nscenario results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.4 miles.  The toxic endpoint is the \ntheoretical distance from the source where the concentration could result in harm if the \nexposure occurred in excess of a one-hour period.  For anhydrous ammonia, the toxic endpoint \nconcentration is 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L).\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWSI recognizes that an effective risk management program involves continuous improvement and \nis committed to providing a safe environment for its employees, customers, and the surrounding \narea.  Improvements are implemented when possible to support this commitment.  These \nimprovements m"

These written procedures address the following issues:\n\n* Technical basis for the proposed change(s)\n* Impact of the proposed change(s) on health, safety, and environment\n* Modification of the operating procedures\n* Implementation schedule for the proposed change(s)\n* Authorization for the proposed change(s)\n\nEmployees involved with affected processes will be informed and trained in the changes as \nearly as practicable prior to startup of the process involved.  Written operating procedures \nwill be updated as needed.\n\nWhen nonconformance conditions are identified, WSI will take the following measures:\n \n* Shutdown of processes and operations.\n* Collecting and containing released waste.\n* Removing or isolating containers.\n* Monitoring for leaks, ruptures, etc.\n* Ensuring sufficient temporary storage of generated wastes.\n* Arranging for repair or replacement of affected system areas.\n\nWSI has not identified any equipment, process, or management change that will be implemented \nfor this process.
