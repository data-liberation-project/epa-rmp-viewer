      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION (\u00a72745.3(a)) \nThe Goodrich Corporation (Collins Aerospace) facility on Norwalk Blvd in Santa Fe Springs produces carbon brakes and other components for aircraft. Carbon fiber textile material is received by the facility where it is prepared for the brake production process. The furnace deck process includes densification, heat treatment, and coating. The machine shop process includes machining and hardware assembly. \n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED (\u00a72745.3(b)) \nMETHYLCHLOROSILANE \nThe facility uses Methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) in the brake production process. The facility currently can store up to six full cylinders (approximately 1000 lb. /cylinder) onsite. These cylinders are stored in the site gas feed shelter which has adequate secondary containment. The area is 20\u0092x21\u0092x2\u0092 and has an internal barrier such that one section has 31 sq. ft. of surface area and the other has 182 sq. ft. of surface area for containment. There are three process connections where the cylinders are heated to maintain the temperature of the cylinders while MTS is being used in the process. The empty cylinder storage-process area will not contain levels of MTS that are greater than the California or Federal threshold trigger levels. \n\nPROPANE COMPRESSED GAS \nThe facility uses propane gas as a feedstock material in the production process and is stored in an 18,000-gallon liquid storage tank.  The maximum intended inventory of the storage tank is 16,500 gallons (69,300 lbs). The criterion to include Propane Gas (flammable) in the PSM program is a quantity more than 10,000 pounds. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (\u00a72745.3(d)) \nThe Goodrich Corporation (Collins Aerospace) facility has not had an accident involving the Methyltrichlorosilane and Propane Gas systems during the past five years, which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or responses or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM (\u00a72745.J(c)) \nA Risk Management Program that includes"
