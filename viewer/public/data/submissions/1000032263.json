The facility has three (3) refrigeration processes, each consisting of industrial grade machinery with piping, valves, ASME certified vessels, cooling air units and refrigeration compressors.  This equipment utilizes anhydrous ammonia, a natural refrigerant for the refrigeration systems. Changes in pressure through the refrigeration cycle relate directly to changes in temperature of the refrigerant. For example, lowering the pressure of a refrigerant lowers its temperature. Low pressure, (cold) The ammonia refrigerant absorb heat through storage room air units.  Removal of the heat from the room provides the refrigeration affect.  Removal of ambient heat from products in turn reduces the spoilage and allows for extended storage of food products.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #766-41-7) Refrigerant grade, pure anhydrous ammonia is the chemical in the process that is reglated at this address.  In low concentrations ammonia is easily detectable and has a pungent odor that makes it ideal as a refrigerant because of this self alarming characteristic.\n\n\n\nThree individual refrigeration systems are present at the Americold San Antonio facility.  \n\nEach are seperated by reasonable distance and are not inter-connected.  Each process resides in different building structures with seperate process equipment.  \n\n\n\nOne process at this address has the potent"
