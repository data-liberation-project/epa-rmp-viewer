      "SummaryText": "\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY\nF.T. Precision, Inc. (FTP), is committed to preserving the safety of its associates, the surrounding community and the environment, through the implementation of environmental, health and safety (EH&S) management systems and procedures.  We are registered to ISO 14001, which provides the framework for assessing and managing potential EH&S hazards.  Additionally, we maintain a risk management committee comprised of associates from manufacturing, engineering and human resources.  This committee meets regularly to discuss the risk management program, assess procedures, ensure that procedures are implemented, and make revisions as needed.  All of our associates are aware of potential hazards associated with our heat treat process and our release prevention program.  We encourage our associates to be involved in the program and offer feedback.\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \nFTP manufactures high quality engine and drive train components (rocker arms and rollers) for automobile engines.  The plant is situated in a 173,000 square foot building on 63 acres just outside Fredericktown, Ohio, and employs approximatel\n185 associates.\nIn order to harden certain drive train components, we operate series of heat-treating furnaces.  The heat-treating process involves passing the components through a special atmosphere in the furnaces.  This atmosphere utilizes ammonia and propane as feed stocks.\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 9,200-gallon storage tank located northwest of the main building.  The level in the tank is maintained by administrative controls at a maximum of 85% of the total, or 7,820 gallons.  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at atmospheric pressure and normal temperatures, but is maintained in a liquid state by pressure.  The heat treat process uses ammonia vapor, which is supplied from vapor in the headspace in the tank.  If insufficient vapor is available, then "

      "SummaryText": "liquid ammonia is routed to an electric vaporizer, which provides additional vapor to the headspace of the tank.  Ammonia vapor pressure is regulated to 20-psig prior to delivery to the process.\nPropane is stored in an 18,000-gallon storage tank located northwest of the main building, near the ammonia tank.  The level in the tank is maintained by administrative controls to a maximum level of 85% of the total, or 15,300 gallons.  Propane is a gas at normal temperatures and pressures, but is stored in the tank as a liquid due to pressure.  The heat treat process utilizes gaseous propane, which is supplied by a  gas fired propane vaporizer.\n \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOur facility is subject to two major chemical accident prevention rules:\n- The Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, found at 40 CFR 68, and;\n- The Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule found at 29 CFR 1910.119.\nWe are in full compliance with these regulations and have implemented steps as required, to reduce the likelihood and impact of potential releases as follows:\n-    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A team of FTP personnel examined our entire heat treat process, using a What-if type analysis technique.  The team used process safety information for the ammonia and propane systems, to arrive at potential release scenarios, the consequences if the scenario were to occur, and existing safeguards in place.  The risk of each scenario was ranked according to likelihood and severity.  The team then decided if existing safeguards were adequate and if not, a recommendation for improvement was developed.  Recommendations are promptly resolved.  All associates have access to the results of the PHA.\n-    Operating Procedures.  We have developed safe operating procedures for the heat treat process.  These procedures include: initial start-up; normal start-up and shutdown; n"

      "SummaryText": "ormal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdowns and operations; start-up following normal or emergency shutdown or major change; consequences of deviation from normal operations; and equipment inspections.  All of our operating personnel are part of an on-going training program for operating procedures.\n-    Mechanical Integrity. We have implemented a program to inspect and maintain all critical components of the heat treat process.  This program utilizes the manufacturer?s operations and maintenance recommendations, good engineering practice, and our own maintenance experience to regularly inspect and assess the condition of process equipment. We repair or replace any equipment that does not meet our specifications.\n-    Management of Change. We have implemented a system to ensure that any changes to the heat treat process are analyzed for potential hazards not previously considered.  This system also helps us to ensure that our program is current.  Before we start a new process, or after a significant change to the system, we complete a formal pre-startup safety review.\n-    Incident Investigation.  We investigate all incidents and ?near miss? incidents involving the heat treat process. Our investigation allows us to learn more about the process, to prevent recurrence or similar incidents.  We review the results of our investigation with associates and contractors, if involved.\n-    Contractors.  We recognize that contractors or visitors may not be familiar with the hazards of our heat treat process.  To help assure the safety of our associates, visitors and contractors, we have implemented a contractor safety program whereby contractors are pre-qualified, informed as to the hazards, and periodically evaluated while on site. \n-    Safety Systems.  Our heat treat process has been equipped with certain safety systems intended to prevent, or minimize the effects of a release.  Examples of these systems are: excess flow valves on the ammonia and propane tanks, pressure r"

We also have written emergency procedures, in case the system approaches unsafe limits.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe have not had any releases of covered chemicals in the last five years, that are reportable under the Risk Management Program rule.\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWe are a defensive responder to releases of hazardous materials.  We have developed and implemented an emergency action plan, which details the steps we take in an emergency.  This plan specifies that we call 911 to summon emergency services in case of a release.  A trained HAZMAT team will respond to the release, and our associates will evacuate to a safe area.  The Local Area Planning Commission (LEPC) is familiar with our Risk Management Plan, and will arrange for notification of the public, if necessary.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWe continually strive to improve the safety of our operations through regular ISO 14000 audits along with suggestions and observations from the risk management and safety committee.  In addition, EH&S improvements will be made as a result of incident investigations from near misses and accidents."
