Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accidental History\nThere has been one accidental releases of a substances regulated by the RMP rule during the last five years that had on-site or off-site impacts. This event is discussed in detail in the Accident Histrory section of the RMP submittal. \n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nThe Bayport plant maintains a written emergency response plan to minimize the effects of any unforeseen accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes many aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incidental decontamination of affected areas.  The facility\u00bfs emergency response plan has been coordinated with the LaPorte and Pasadena Local Emergency Planning committee (LEPC).\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced and our emergency response team conducts regular training and drills.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  A hydrocarbon detection system is planned for installation in and around selected process areas to provide early warning for gas leaks.  This system will allow the facility to promptly detect and respond to gas leaks before they become serious.  Over-blast protection is planned for the Polypropylene Contro"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nEquistar\u00bfs primary activities encompass ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives manufacturing.  We manufacture or utilize 4 regulated substances at Equistar; ethylene oxide (EO), anhydrous ammonia, methane and ethylene.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carr"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenace and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure process equipment is functioning properly.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits\nEquistar conducts audits on a regular basis t verify the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEquistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as many corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  Investigation reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEquistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation to the RMP rule, particularly information resulting from process hazard analysis.\n\nThe Bayport plant has attained the highest level of recognition in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), the OSHA STAR.  As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
