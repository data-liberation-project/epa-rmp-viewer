      "SummaryText": "The objective of The Willow Road Reservoir is to maintain public health by providing safe drinking water, free of pathogens. This involves the addition of chlorine that, if released in an uncontrolled manner, may present a risk to public health. While such incidents are rare, they have occurred. The Village of Winnetka Water Plant has enacted a Risk Management Program.\n\nThe goal of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine. The organization?s management is committed to achieving this goal. The purpose of the management program is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RPMprogram understands their roles and responsibilities and that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements. This includes employee training and education. \n\nThe Willow Road Reservoir no longer has chlorine storage. All equipment and detection systems are still in place in the event chlorine use is required.\n\nOur chlorination system uses modern electronic technology to inject and control the process. Alarms, diagnosis, and controls are constantly monitored by a supervisory control and data acquisition system. The 150 pound chlorine cylinders need to be handled manually. The worst case scenario would be 150 pounds released over a 10 minute period. We allow only experienced and trained personnel to handle chlorine cylinders to prevent accidental releases.\n\nWe have excellent communications with local emergency responders. Training and alert systems are reviewed on a regular basis. \n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose "

Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP."
