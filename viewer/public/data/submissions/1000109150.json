      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Lightning Dock Geothermal (LDG) Power Plant\n\nThe LDG Power Plant is located at 15 Greenhouse Drive, Animas New Mexico in the county of Hidalgo near the town of Animas New Mexico. The facility is committed to being a responsible member of the nearby communities. Site policy dictates that the LDG Power Plant continuously identify methods to identify and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safe technologies and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in policies and safety procedures at the facility which are available to all employees who are trained to these policies and safety procedures.\n \nDescription of the Lightning Dock Geothermal Power Plant and the Regulated Substance Used.\n\n  The power plant uses heat from geothermal brine at approximately 310 degrees Fahrenheit to heat, through a non-contact heat exchange process, a single turbine isobutane process that converts the geothermal heat to electric power for sale to PNM, through transmission to Columbus Electric Cooperative, the local energy cooperative for the local communities' electric power needs. The isobutane used in the closed loop (recirculated/recycled) power generation process is the only regulated substance at the site. The facility can have on site up to approximately 57,200 gallons of isobutane being used in the process or being stored. It is expected that, due to fugitive emission losses, no more than one truck of approximately 4,200 gallons of makeup isobutane will be required per year and, in fact, continuous monitoring of leakages and proper maintenance will in all eventuality reduce fugitive emission losses and need to replenish significantly. When isobutane is delivered to the site it will be off loaded at a designated isobutane storage area and under well qualified employees and approved safe operating procedures.\n\nThe power g"

      "SummaryText": "eneration process (ORC Turbogenerator) consists of heat exchangers (two preheaters and one evaporator) which absorb heat from the geothermal brine in order to boil and convert the iso butane into its vapor phase. The vaporized iso butane is then directed to a turbine specially designed to convert thermal energy in the iso butane to rotational mechanical energy. The turbine which is directly coupled to a generator, in turn, rotates the generator leading to the generation of electrical power. Iso butane from the turbine is directed through a regenerator and then to the air cooled condensers that complete the condensing of iso butane back to its liquid phase. From the condensers isobutane falls to the suction of feed pumps which pressurize the iso butane and direct the iso butane through the regenerator, a non-contact heat exchange process, to absorb heat from the iso butane moving from the turbine outlet to the condensers. From the regenerator the pressurized isobutane is once again directed to the two preheaters and evaporator.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario evaluated was that of a ruptured isobutane tank leading to a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) condition using 300,872 pounds of isobutane. The maximum distance to an over pressure of 1 psi is 0.5 miles (0.9 kilometers). The EPA's RMP Off site Consequence Analysis Guidelines for Worst-Case Scenario were calculated using RMP*Comp. Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in an actual event, would mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.\n\n The Alternate Case Release Scenario evaluated based on the 1\" pipe from the regenerator to the feed pump suction being hit, ruptured, subsequent hot liquefied iso butane leaking, and an ensuing vapor cloud explosion event that lasts for 20 minutes before any mitigating efforts can take effect.  Using RMP*Comp to perfo"

The intent of an incident investigation is for employers/employees to learn from past experiences and thus avoid repeating past mistakes. \n\nThis procedure is designed to meet the strict criteria of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThe Incident Investigation process should be applied to all Accidents, Incidents, Incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release, and Near Misses that occur. OSHA N AC definitions of these conditions are as follows:\n\tIncident: An unplanned, undesired event that adversely affects completion of a task.\n\tCatastrophic Release: An uncontrolled emission, fire or explosion involving one or more highly hazardous substances or explosives that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of the employees, the public health or the environment.  The term includes events that occur within a building or other structure that contains the substance or explosive.\n\tAccident: An undesired event that results in personal injury or property damage.\n\tNear Miss: An incident where no property was damaged and no personal injury sustained, but where, given a slight shift in time or position, damage and/or injury easily could have occurred. Note: a Near Miss does not necessarily require a release of process fluids. Any incident that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release under different circumstances should be considered a Near Miss\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThis program was developed to ensure that employees are aware of, have access to and are included in the development of Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures & Standard"
