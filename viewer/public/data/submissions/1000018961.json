If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Durant Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 6 LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Sunbury, Iowa location is John Trenkamp, location manager.

      "SummaryText": "OPERATIVE, SUNBURY, IOWA:\r\n\r\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of three (3) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.                                         \r\n\r\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves and emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplersdesigned to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are to be locked when not in use.\r\n\r\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Sunbury, provisions have been desig"

An evacuation plan is in place.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1999 with amendments and State law. \r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, River Valley Cooperative has extended to the Durant Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nRiver Valley Cooperative, Sunbury, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place. However, on November 5, 2008 there was an off-site release related to a contract anhydrous ammonia applicator who failed to properly secure the portable nurse tank to the toolbar. The hitch pin came loose allowing the nurse tank to separate from the toolbar applicator. The transfer hose between the nurse tank and the toolbar applicator was stretched to the breaking point when the quick coupler failed to disengage as designed. The liquid withdrawal valve on the nurse tank was in the fully open position. The applicator could not safely reach and close the liquid withdrawal valve. Because the nurse tank was almost full at the time of the release, approximately 4940 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released to the atmosphere. There were no injuries, deaths, shelterings-in-place or evacuations that resulted from this off-site incident.\r\n\r\nTHE EM"

In the unlikely event that the Durant Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Sunbury location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Durant has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 6 LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nThis plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.
