The Facility Plan:  The ouners and employees of Gramley Farms, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintence and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n2. Facility Informaaation:  The primaary activity at the facility is the storaaage of anhydrous ammonia for use by Gramley Farms on their own farmland.  Anydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributes for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 56,000 pounds in the facility's tank.\n3. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total content of the storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The mazimum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which would represent the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited be design standards and company procedure.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .84 miles.  The alternative case release scenario is assumed to be the distance from the rupture of a 2 inch diameter transfer hose, with 11,908 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint os dispersion is .56 miles.\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Ruses and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 DFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n5.  The Five Year Accidental History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous amm"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergence action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed by the local fire department and provided to the local emergence planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.  \n7.  Planed Changes:  Safety improvements are an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
