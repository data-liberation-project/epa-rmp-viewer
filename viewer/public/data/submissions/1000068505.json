Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Croda Atlas Point site uses ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) as raw materials in the manufacture of various surface active agents (surfactants). Surfactants are used in household, personal care and industrial applications.  It is Croda's policy to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations. Croda is in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program, 40 CFR Part 68. The 5-year RMP submission is being made in accordance with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 68-190(b)(1).\n\n\n\nOn the corporate level Croda mandates safety performance metrics and holds each site accountable to attain the corporate safety goals.  Croda provides process safety training for key technical personnel at each site to ensure competence in identifying and mitigating hazards.  Croda sponsors the AO Users Group, a group dedicated to improving safe use of EO and PO with representation from sites worldwide, including Atlas Point.  This group has developed a minimum requirements guidance document for the safe use of EO and PO.  Croda has also mandated the appointment of a Site Responsible Engineer at each site, with the task of ensuring that industry design standards are followed.\n\n\n\nCroda has been independently certified to be in compliance with the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care RC14001 standard.  The standard requires systems to be in place and working to control environmental, health and safety aspects and minimize impacts to the community.\n\n\n\nThe Croda Atlas Point site has technical personnel whose work is dedicated to occupational and process safety as well as environmental stewardship.  They conduct process hazard analyses (PHAs) prior to the design, construction and operation of any process unit.  Records are kept of each PHA and the actions implemented as an outc"

The safety department also conducts incident investigations to determine the events and causal factors of each incident with the goal to improve safety and prevent reoccurrences.  A Behavior Based Safety program is also in place at Atlas Point to encourage all employees to recognize and encourage safe practices. \n\n\n\nCroda has made safety performance a priority at the Atlas Point facility.  We have partnered with OSHA in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) a voluntary program for worksites that show excellence in occupational safety and health. This shows Croda's commitment to effective employee protection beyond the requirements of OSHA standards. As a VPP STAR Worksite, Croda has developed and implemented systems to identify, evaluate, prevent, and control occupational hazards to prevent employee injuries and illnesses. \n\n\n\nThe Croda Atlas Point site also has a Community Advisory Council, which meets quarterly to foster communication with our neighbors and answer questions of concern.  Participants include the Delaware State Police, the Delaware Bridge and River Authority, a local school district, local businesses and government agencies, as well as local community organizations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Croda Atlas Point site produces hundreds of products that provide desired chemical properties for household cleaning products, personal care products, and industrial applications.  The site contains ten different processing units designed to provide the range of chemical specialties required.  Raw Materials are received in railcars, tank trucks and drums.  Products are shipped out in tank trucks or drums.  Several of the processing units use EO or PO as raw materials to make desired products.  EO and PO are toxic chemicals regulated by RMP.  \n\n\n\nIn 2018 a new processing unit will come on-line to produce EO from ethanol.  P"

      "SummaryText": "reviously, EO was received in railcars and was stored on-site in railcars prior to use.  The ability to convert ethanol to EO will substantially reduce the amount of EO railcars stored on-site, replaced by ethanol, a less hazardous material, that does not need to be regulated under RMP.  The process of converting ethanol to EO consists of converting ethanol to ethylene and then ethylene to EO.  Ethylene is a flammable material regulated by RMP.  There is no storage of ethylene on-site; it is consumed as it is produced in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3 specified in 40 CFR 68.65 to 68.87. The components include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor work.  The Atlas Point site is also regulated under the OSHA PSM standard 1910.119 for the toxic and flammable materials on-site.\n\n\n\nAtlas Point uses expert industry consultants to advice on compliance with industry standards from NFPA, ANSI, API, ISA and others. \n\n\n\nSome of the safety features in use, categorized as passive or active mitigation systems include the following.\n\n\n\n- A network of 90 combustible gas sensors located strategically to detect leaks or loss of containment. Leak detection by the sensors will automatically trigger a staged response, starting with an alarm and progressing to firewater deluge, depending on the extent of the leak.\n\n\n\n- Ethylene oxide gas sensors worn by personnel in the process areas.  These sensors alarm if ppm levels of ethylene oxide are detected, allowing personnel to respond prior to exposure to harmful concentrations.  They also provide an early warning if there are leaks.\n\n\n\n- A remote emergenc"

The spill sump was designed to contain releases from a railcar or the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.  The spill sump confines the chemical and is equipped with a water spray system to dilute and contain the spill, thereby reducing the amount released to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n- A diked area surrounds the storage tanks.  The diked area captures spills and directs the liquid to the spill sump by gravity.  The remote location collects leaks of flammable liquid away from process equipment to prevent the spread of fire. Preventing the accumulation of flammable liquids under the storage tank greatly reduces the risk of a storage tank BLEVE. \n\n \n\n- A water deluge system is installed to quench fires and absorb leaks of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.  It is designed based upon the National Fire Protection (NFPA) standards.\n\n\n\n- All of the chemical processing units have computer control and monitoring.  These systems monitor key parameters such as temperature and pressure and will automatically control the system within safe operating parameters. A redundant interlock system (Safety Instrumented System), independent of the computer control system, is in place to monitor and set the process to a safe state if critical conditions are encountered and the computer control system does not respond. \n\n\n\n- Alarms are wired and controlled through the computer control system and sound an audible alarm as well as a visual flag.  Alarms are early warning systems which send an alert of potential leaks. \n\n\n\n- Emergency backup power for key equipment and control components.\n\n\n\n- Packed column scrubbers are installed to capture the small amounts EO and PO emissions that are generated under normal operations. The scrubber was designed to remove emissions at a much higher than normal concentration and rate to insure that a potential upset condition would be controlled.\n\n\n\n- Relief valves are safety device"

Relief valves vent at elevations adequate to prevent any hazardous vapor cloud released from drifting back down to where it might cause exposure issues. \n\n\n\n- A dispersion stack for the EO Storage tanks relief valve outlet was included to control and disperse emissions during an emergency release.  The stack insures that the concentrations at the ground level would be less than OSHA's Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) levels. The modeling used to design the stack included scenarios provided by DNREC and incorporated worst case scenario features.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Croda performs a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) inspection twice annually, which will detect small leaks and repair them before they become a hazard. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the last five years the Croda Atlas Point facility has had no releases from the ethylene oxide or propylene oxide processes that posed a threat to people on-site, off-site, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Emergency Response section, specified in 40 CFR 68.90 to 68.95.\n\nCroda maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the site's emergency response program. The local community emergency response organization, Hollaway Terrace Fire Department, and the New Castle County Local Emergency Planning Council (LEPC) have received a copy of the ICP and have included it in the community emergency response plan. \n\n\n\nIt is Croda's policy to respond in an efficient and effective manner to any emergency that occurs at the Croda Atlas Point site. Croda personnel regularly prepare for emergencies by conducting emergency drills that have included the local fire department.  A group of Croda employees have been trained to act as emergency responders and/or incident commanders.  Croda emergency personnel can be "
