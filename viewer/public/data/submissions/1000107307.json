If a spill occurred, the entire contents should stay in a dike.\nA new tank dike partition was constructed in late 2001 to minimize potential RMP worst case scenario off-site impact.\n Automatic high level alarms and shutoffs are installed to prevent tank overfilling.\n The tank is filled to no more than 90% capacity, as additional protection against overfilling. \n Pressure/safety devices are installed so that the tank cannot be over/under pressurized.\n During tank filling, the unloading trailer is staged in a contained area large enough to hold the entire trailer contents.\n Sewers in the vicinity of the tank can be used if necessary to convey spillage to a pre-treatment system capable of treating NPCF.\n Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to startup of new or modified NPCF equipment.\n Team of trained personnel conducts Process Hazard Analyses at least every 5 years.\n\nWe strive to OPERATE Safely:\n We have established written safe operating limits for the process using NPCF.\n Safety reviews are conducted for proposed process changes.\n We have detailed unloading, operating and maintenance procedures.\n Operators are trained and certified per OSHA"

Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at Arkema for many years;  this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  We are committed to conducting our operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety starts with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Senior management routinely dedicate time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors. \n\nArkema Inc.'s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill its commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents. \n\nOur plant keeps health and safety in the forefront of all our activities.
