(?Unified Grocers?) to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at Unified Grocers to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency preparedness procedures including emergency response, spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms, and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by Unified Grocers and are summarized in this Plan and the facility?s Process Safety Management Manual and Emergency Evacuation Plan.  \n\nThis Plan, the Emergency Evacuation Plan, and Process Safety Management Manual document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Unified Grocers.\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nUnified Grocers is located at 6433 SE Lake Road in Milwaukie, Oregon (the ?facility?).  The facility is situated within a commercial and residential area and occupies approximately sixty two acres of land.  The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for frozen meats and processed foods.  The frozen foods warehouse is equipped with evaporators to keep desired areas cold.  Liquid ammonia is transferred from a high pressure receiver to the evaporator units through direct expansion valves.  The low pressure liquid is directed to evaporating units, or coils, to provide refrigeration for cold production and storage areas.  The ammonia system contains a maximum of approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAmmonia is a listed substance regulated und"

Processes containing a listed substance in quantities greater than the federal threshold (10,000 pounds) are subject to the federal Risk Management Program.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nUnified Grocers has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.  The Plan?s purpose is to enhance the facility?s existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of regulated substances that could cause harm employees, the public, and the environment.  The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility has safely operated in the City of Milwaukie since 1980.  Key elements of the facility?s safety program include written environmental health and safety procedures, employee training, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving reportable listed substances in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response activities with the Clackamas County Fire District.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility?s emergency response program is documented in the facility's emergency evacuation plan.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n1.  Procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n2.  Information on emergency health care.\n3.  Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a summary of planned changes to improve safety:\n\n1.  Update P&ID for ammonia "
