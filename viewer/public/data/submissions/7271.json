Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the processing and storage temperature for margarine and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 18,500   pounds (i.e., 3,500 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 18,500 pounds of liquid ammonia (the system inventory).  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only about 3,000 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The margarine processing units (MPUs) operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly freeze product on scrape surface heat exchangers.  Ammonia suction from the MPUs at about 0 psig passes through the low side accumulator before entering the booster compressors.  Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side acc"

The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors.\n\nThe high side compressor suction draws from the intercooler (booster discharge) and the high side suction accumulator at about 30 psig.  This accumulator receives suction from an ice builder, air handlers, and various cooler units.  Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and returned to the system.\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig, is vented to five condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for operation of the pumper drums.\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air handlers.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the properly line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios (a wo"

This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated May 1996.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n2.1    WORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the high pressure receiver (approximately 18,500 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 8,300 feet or 1.6 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs every three years by a Factory Mutual inspector who has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is inspected on a semi-annual basis by a competent ammonia refrige"

The vessel is also inspected daily by a plant facility mechanic, trained in the operation of the system.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the high pressure receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\n* Only rarely are the entire contents of the system intentionally pumped back to the receiver.  Typically, the receiver contains only 3,000 pounds, resulting in an endpoint distance of 3,500 feet (less than 0.7 miles).  \n\n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture "

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  Because the high pressure receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation1 was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation2 was considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes Lipton employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements"

A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA resulted in 50 procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the refrigeration system.  These recommendations are in the process of being resolved and many changes have already been implemented.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared during 1995 through 1998 to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.
