Additionally, the Boothwyn Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills which involve potential releases.   The contract company that performs the transload operations at the facility is working to improve its training program.\r\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information regarding the management of the risks associated with the flammable substance storage process. Above all, ETM&T stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees, visitors and the community."

      "SummaryText": "Energy Transfer Marketing & Terminals\r\nTwin Oaks Terminal\r\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Energy Transfer Marketing & Terminals  (ETM&T) Twin Oaks Facility, hereafter referred to as the Facility, is a refined petroleum\r\nproduct storage and distribution facility in Delaware County, PA.  A new butane system was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) #58 for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane system only, including the butane offload station, butane storage tank (60,000gal), butane transfer pump, and associated butane piping. \r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\r\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\r\nETM&T is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. ETM&T has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Boothwyn Fire Department.\r\n\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to\r\nthe flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human\r\nexposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.\r\nThe Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health."
