Franzia/McFarland's Risk Management Plan details the chain of command and the authority of the individuals assigned to manage the RMP.\n\nThe accidental release prevention  measures and emergency response policies are based on knowledge of the systems and training on how to prevent releases and control (minimize) releases should they occur.  Accidental release prevention is accomplished by routine inspection of the integrity of  the process systems, reporting of any detected odors immediately to management and to maintain operations logs on systems.  Training on the ammonia refrigeration system is scheduled prior to the peak harvest season (August through November) for all maintenance and cellar employees so that any releases will be minimized by understanding controls on and knowledge of the system.\n\nThe two regulated substances handled by Franzia/McFarland are anhydrous liquid ammonia and anhydrous sulfur dioxide.  Anhydrous liquid ammonia is used in the plant's refrigeration system and is stored in two (2) separate ammonia receivers and the piping used to move the ammonia from compressor to heat exchanger and back to the receiver.  The sulfur dioxide is used as a wine/juice antioxidant and preservative.  It is delivered to the facility in portable, one ton cylinders.  Sulfur dioxide is added to wine/juice through the use of portable addition cylinders ranging from 6 lbs. to 100 lbs. in capacity.\n\nFranzia/McFarland has had no accidents involving the regulated substances in the past seven (7) years.\n\nFranzia/McFarland's emergency response program (ammonia and sulfur dioxide) includes detailed procedures for responding to an injured emloyee, evacuation procedures and emergency notification control phone numbers.
