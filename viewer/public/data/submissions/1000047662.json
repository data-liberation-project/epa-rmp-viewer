Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nBecause of the importance of good moral, a good employee relationship, high cost of injury and illness and the high cost of company property, Lanier Cold Storage requires that its management and employees follow all safety programs to ensure a safe and friendly work environment. It is our belief that no work is so important to overlook the safety programs in place. It is also our belief that all management is responsible for ensuring that any and all employees have a safe work place and to enforce all safety rules and regulations. It is our belief that all employees are responsible for following the safety rules and regulations. Therefore, by following these procedures Lanier Cold Storage will provide a safe and friendly work environment for its employees while also preventing damage to company property and will comply with all applicable safety and health regulations.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAS Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals,29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAS Risk Management Program (RM Program)regulation (Risk Management Program for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant release of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handles\n\n\n\nThe Lanier Cold Storage facility is engaged in the warehouse and distribution of food products. Product stored in frozen, refrigerated, or dry warehouse and then loaded and distributed by tractor trailer to various customers. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provi"

The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 23,000 pounds. Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program #3 requirements of the EPAS RM program.\n\n\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major pressures (temperatures) for the use in the preservation and process of perishable food products. Through the use of single stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25F and 25F. The higher the pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegradable process. Normal safeties include: high pressure cu-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for the machine room areas.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nTraining\n\nContractors\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPre-start up Safety Review\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nD. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years\n\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release. The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the Hall County EMA.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on "
