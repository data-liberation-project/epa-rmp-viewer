(Hollis Facility) are committed to safe operations and prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of a release, the facility will work with local Fire Departments, the LEPC, and Emergency Mgmt Coordinator to mitigate any release and minimize impact on the community and the environment.\nFacility Information:  The primary function of the Facility is the storage and retail sale of Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers in the surrounding area.  Anhydrous is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored on-site is 84,118 lbs(based on 56% filling density) in an 18,000 gallon tank.\nWorst Case & Alternative Scenario:  The worst-case scenario would be release of 84,118 lbs of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes; distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.27 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming \"agricultural terrain.  The Alternative Scenario would be the release of 5,954 lbs/minute for 2 minutes, due to transfer hose failure;  distance to the toxic endpoint is .6 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68; ANSI, K-61.; 29 CFR 1910.111; 40 CFR Part 355; 29 CFR 1910.1200;\n5 Year Accident History: Ther have been no accidental releases  in the past 5 years that (a) have caused any deaths, or significant property damage at the facility nor (b) to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\nEmergency Response Program:  The Facility has a written Emergency Response Plan, as prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 68; 29 CFR 1910.120; and 40 CFR Part 355 (EPCRA).  The Facility has provided the LEPC and other authorities/agencies the emergency planning information required under SARA, Title III.\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:  Safet"
