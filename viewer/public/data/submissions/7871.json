General accidental release and prevention policy of Gorton's.\n\nGorton' is a frozen seafood processing facility that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. \nAnhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same\nproperties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain\nsafety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community\nand the environment.  \nIt is our policy at Gorton's to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by\nmanaging and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state\nregulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release\nof hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant\npersonnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices\nthat are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nGorton's, 127 Rogers Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts operates a refrigeration system utilizing\nanhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic\nprocess where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired\ntemperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation,\ncompression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the\nquantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to\nchange the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process.\nThe ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vap"
