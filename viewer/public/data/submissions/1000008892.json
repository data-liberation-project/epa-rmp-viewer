An outline of the RMP is provided in Figure ES-1.

The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (Plan), as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It consists of a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA which will eventually be uploaded onto a public access data base. The Plan has an Executive Summary that follows a required EPA format, and is intended to inform the public of The Well Field Pump Station's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario each for the chlorine sys"

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (I, II, or III) the Well Field Pump Station falls. \n\nResidences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Well Field Pump Station's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I. Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program III, Well Field Pump Station is included in Risk Management Program II.  The Hazard Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was defined as a ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within 10 minute duration. This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model RMP Comp 2.01. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 1.30 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was also modeled using RMP Comp 2.01. Source term estimation of approximately 175 pounds released was derived from a scenario of a vacuum regulator check unit failure. The dispersion model estimated the 3 ppm chlorine footprint to extend to 0.10 miles.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents have ever occurred at the plant involving either onsite or offsite consequences within the last five years. \n\nManagement Program\n\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below.\n\nDocument Management System\n\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, described below in Table ES-2.\n\nRisk Management Program Team\n\nThe following members "

Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in more detail below.\n\nSafety Information\n\nSafety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information, and Process Safety Information.  Each is described below.\n\nChemical Safety Information\n\nComprehensive chemical data is provided in this section to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on these substances. The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant processes are modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Specifications are collocated in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section.

      "SummaryText": " Review\n\nA Hazard Review was conducted for the chlorine system. The team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a \"What If\" analysis. The \"What If\" was developed from HAZOP experience at similar treatment facilities.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement. The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Bryan to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating Procedures have been developed for the Well Field Pump Station. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine system. Procedures include Start, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation. Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\nTraining \n\nTraining is required by EPA to be included in the Risk Management Program. A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required training documentation. Additionally, a Training Record has been compiled and included for all affected personnel associated with the covered processes.\n\nMaintenance\n\nA Maintenance Program has been developed with associated documentation forms. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, as well as to the off-site public. State and federal regulators will most surely expect to see documentation and recordkeeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn Incident Investigation Program has b"

Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learn from the incident and take action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The Public Works Director must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. Audit Report Forms are provided, the two most recent of which must always be maintained.

As in all the above programs, it is important to review this program regularly. The RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.95 requires training for all employees \"in relevant procedures\" of the Emergency Response Program.\n\nIt is recommended that training on the specific plant procedures take place upon initial employment and every three years thereafter, as with most of the other RMP training programs.
