Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRecords of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process are maintained.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nA training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDocumented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations are on going.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Any equipment d"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nOur facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nInvestigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's RMP.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  We have a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.\n\n5.

Schou\nAddress:   Henry, Illinois\nPhone:       309-364-2361\n\n\n1.  Facility Policy.\n\nWe at United Suppliers, Inc., Henry Operation are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our continuing development and implementation of measures and policies intended to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event of a release, Henry Operations has an Emergency Action Plan in place to minimize the potential effects of a release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of granulated dry Nitrogen (N), Phosphate (P), and Potash (K) fertilizers.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a source of Nitrogen (N) for the production of dry granulated NPK fertilizers.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is 260,000 pounds in storage tanks.\n\n3.  The worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\n      a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternate release scenario, a 2-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or manual shut-off valve is closed or emergency shutdown system(s) would stop the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 12,000 pounds.  The distance to t"
