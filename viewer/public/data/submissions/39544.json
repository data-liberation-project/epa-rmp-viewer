      "SummaryText": "The City of LaGrange Water Division Risk Management plan for handling chlorine saftely contains an integrated approach using technology, uniform procedures, and close management to monitor potential chlorine hazards; therefore, minimizing the risk of accidental chlorine releases. All procedures associated with 40 CRF 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which will assist in employee safety, public health associated with chlorine, and coordinate with response agencies.\n\nThe Walter D. Williams Jr. Water Filter Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water withdrawn from West Point Reservoir. Finish water from this plant serves the City of LaGrange, surrounding areas of Troup County, and also supplies the City of Greenville in Meriweather County as a wholesale customer. The chlorination process includes (liquid) chlorine cylinders, chlorine feed equipment, electrical and chemical control equipment, and safety equipment associated with this process. \n\nDue to the presents of a chlorination process, accidental release modeling was conducted for the impacted area in order to determine potential consequences associated with process failures, which would result in accidental release of chlorine. The first model \" worst case \" scenario, as defined by EPA, states \" The owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\" An incident history review was conducted at the Walter D. Williams Jr. Water Filter Plant, which assisted in identifying the most likely release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreased to a theoretical \"toxic end point.\" This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \" the maximium airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals cou"

They are as follows:\n       * Operator Training\n       * Preventive Maintenance Program\n       * Process Specific Safety Equipment\n            1. Respiratory Protection(SCBA) Program\n            2. Chlorine Safety Equipment\n            3. Chemical right to know\n       * Standard operating procedures with emphasis on safety\n       * Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n       * Inspection program\n       * Comprehensive management program\n\nThe Walter D. Williams Jr. Water Filter Plant has a emergency response plan which has been coordinated with the City of LaGrange and Troup County Fire Departments, both of whom are members of the local Emergency Planning Commitee (LEPC). Emergency response evaluations and plant tours are conducted annually, as well as a review of all emergency procedures.\n\nThe City of LaGrange takes an aggressive approach to Risk Management and Emergency Response. Training sessions between LaGrange Utilities and Fire Department personnel will be conducted annually. Preventative measures and continuous improvement of communications will result in effective procedures for safe handling and timely response to potential chlorine hazards."
