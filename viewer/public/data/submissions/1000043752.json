              "Description": "Americold Lynden?s implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The plan includes a preventive maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Americold Lynden has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents.  The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Americold Lynden facility.  Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility. Americold implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations. These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility. The facility is coordinated with the local fire department, who will be the facility's emergency responder.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is installed at the Americold - Lynden facility located at 406 2nd Street Lynden, Washington. The primary business of Americold is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  \n\n\n\n\n\nENGINE ROOM DETAILS\n\n   In order to conduct operations; the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 50,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage.  Typical operating conditions range from 5\" hg on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n   The Americold - Lynden ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern t"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\n\n\nThe facility ammonia refrigeration system operates in accordance with many of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines with which specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors at each evaporator, and automatic shutdown systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia equipment is maintained inside the engine room. All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to a common header, equipped with an ammonia sensor, and vent to the ammonia dilution tank and/or vent to atmosphere above the roof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there have been no recordable accidents to report within the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Americold - Lynden facility has an emergency action plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3. To protect the environment.\n\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the Americold - Lynden facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the "
