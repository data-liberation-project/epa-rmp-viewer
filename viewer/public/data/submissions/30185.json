Chlorine in 1 ton containers is used for wastewater disinfection.\nten is the maximum number of full containers stored on site.  \nChlorine liquid is drawn from a 1 ton container and through an evaporator to form a gas. \nChlorine gas is fed under a vacuum to a chlorinator from the evaporator.  \nThe gas is metered and fed under vacuum or may be mixed with water and fed in solution to the effluent water. \nThis kills any remaining pathogenic bacteria remaining in the effluent prior to discharge to the recieving waters.",

      "SummaryText": "The Anthony Ragnone Treatment Plant (ARTP) in Montrose MI is subject to section 112 of the Clean Air Act due to the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide for wastewater disinfection. Chlorine in 1 ton containers is used for wastewater disinfection.\nTen is the maximum number of full containers stored on site.  \nChlorine liquid is drawn from a 1 ton container and through an evaporator to form a gas. \nChlorine gas is fed under a vacuum to a chlorinator from the evaporator.  \nThe gas is metered and fed under vacuum or may be mixed with water and fed in solution to the effluent water. \nThis kills any remaining pathogenic bacteria remaining in the effluent prior to discharge to the recieving waters.\n\n?Sulfur dioxide in 1 ton containers is used for wastewater chlorine residual removal.  \nten is the maximum number of full containers stored on site.  \nSulfur dioxide is drawn from a 1 ton container and through an evaporator. \nSulfur dioxide is fed to a chlorinator under vacuum from the evaporator.  \nThe gas is metered and fed under vacuum or may be mixed with water and fed in solution to the chlorinated effluent after disinfection.\nThis removes excess chlorine before discharge to the recieving waters.  The Genesee County Division of Water & Waste, who owns and operates the facility, has recently constructed a new disinfection facility at ARTP.  The new facility was constructed to incorporate the latest technology in safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and to accommodate disinfection demands projected for future use.  While the process methodology remains largely the same, sulfur dioxide evaporators were incorporated to increase chlorine removal process efficiency and to minimize the number of tanks required to be \"in-service\" simultaneously.  Other important features incorporated to increase safety in handling of these substances include: 1) Fully enclosed chlorine container storage and handling room.  2) Chlorine scrubber, capacity 2600lbs..  3) Sulfur diox"

The new facility also incorporates all the significant safety features utilized in the former facility:  1) Isolated storage, evaporator, and chlorinator/sulfonator rooms.  The rooms are equipped with independent monitoring, alarms, automated or manual operation scrubber evacuation systems.  2) All cylinders are equipped with automatic shut off valve systems activated by pressure loss or power failure (fail-closed feature).  Only one container is \"in-service\" for both disinfection and dechlorination systems at a time.  All safety systems read at the DCU in the plant control room.  There have been no reportable accidents from either system in the last 5 years.  Security has also been enhanced with card reader access to all entries to the facility and 24/7 surveillance operations.  The general accidental release program incorporates the safety features, process safety management, training and management of change policies to prevent the incidents of accidental release. The Emergency Response Plan was developed with the inclusion of and incorporated resources from the ARTP, the local fire department, the Genesee County HAZMAT Team, and the LEPC.    Significant administrative policy changes are underway to provide for continued effective process safety management, increased operator awareness through training programs, and efficient management of change."
