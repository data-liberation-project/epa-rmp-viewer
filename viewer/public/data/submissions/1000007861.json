The Plant treats raw water from two sources: the Santa Ana River and the State Water Project. The untreated or raw water entering the plant contains sand, suspended particles, and microorganisms, collectively referred to as turbidity, that must be removed before the water enters the distribution system. The basic treatment processes include sand chamber, flocculation basins, sedimentation basins, and filters. Polymers and other chemicals are added at various points to condition the water. Chlorine is added for water disinfection. Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements.\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Horace Hinckley Water Treatment Plant uses the following chemical that is stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nChlorine - One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier. A maximum of 8 one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a ventilated building.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe Horace Hinckley Water Treatment Plant has not had any releases during the past five (5) years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Horace Hinckley Water Treatment Plant is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with its chlorine system. The City of Redlands has developed a PSM safety program to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The PSM safety program includes the following elements:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information:  Enables the employer and employees invol"
