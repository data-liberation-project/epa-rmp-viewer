Specifically, secondary containment has been constructed to contain 110% capacity of the 30,000 gallon aqua ammonia storage tank and to comply with Kansas Department Health & Environment as well as OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products does not respond to releases but maintains an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with local responders.\n\nAqua ammonia is stored and distributed from this location. Aqua Ammonia is stored in an ASME coded pressure vessel and maintained in totally enclosed systems from railcar to distribution vessel, minimizing transfer losses and accidental release potential.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has developed and implemented procedures specific to storage and distribution of aqua ammonia to meet the requirements of a prevention program as outlined in the regulation. Process safety information was gathered specific to the process and a process hazard analysis was conducted and operating procedures were written based upon the process safety information and process hazard analysis. Training was developed and provided to all employees. All other elements of the prevention program has been addressed and followed per the RMP and PSM regulations.\n\nThis Airgas Specialty Products location has not had any RMP defined accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nAirgas Specialty Products has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of aqua ammonia.
