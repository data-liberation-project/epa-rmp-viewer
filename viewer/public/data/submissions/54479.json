Please note that 148,000 pounds is the maximum amount of the combination of the three isomers of pentane that could be present at the site at any one time.  For example, if the current blend is essentially isopentane and 148,000 pounds of isopentane are on-site, virtually no n-pentane would be on site at the same time. \n\nThe process with respect to PSM and RMP regulations starts with the unloading of pentane into the storage tank and continues through the point where cured panels are cut to size.  Process steps include transfer of pentane to a metering skid, injection of pentane at high pressure into a polyol blend, and reaction of the polyol with ISO, using pentane as the expanding agent, to form foam on top of a substrate.  The chemical mixture and substrate are drawn into the laminator oven, where the mixture adheres to the substrate and a top-sheet as the solid foam is formed.   At the crosscut saw station, the sheet is cut into long panels and the edges are trimmed to a precise 4-foot width.  The long panels then move to a gang saw station where additional crosscutting reduces the panels to the desired lengths, typically 4 or 8 feet.  At this point of the process, production of the foam panels using the pentane blowing agent is complete representing the end of the process that is covered under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nHunter Panels maintains a detailed emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Plant Manager serves as facility coordinator for implementation of the emergency action plan. Employees are trained to respond to minor accidental releases at the facility.  Hunter Panels maintains a contract with an off-site emergency responder for large scale environmental emergencies.  The plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a volatile flammable liquid is defined as the detonation of a vapor cloud of the en"

      "SummaryText": "Hunter Panels located at 1700 Enterprise Drive in Kingston, NY manufacturers rigid polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels for use in commercial and industrial roofing applications.  The company employs approximately 75 people at the facility in a non-union environment.  Hunter Panels is located in a 167,000 square foot facility in former IBM Building 52 in the Tech City Industrial Park in the Town of Ulster, Ulster County, NY.  Facility boundaries include Old Neighborhood Road to the North, railroad tracks to the East, and other properties in the industrial park to the South and West.\n\nThe polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels are produced by reacting a polyol (POLY) in a blend including a flame retardant and catalyst with polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (ISO).  Pentane material is used as an expanding or blowing agent in the production of the panels.  Different varieties of pentane material can be used including various blends of n-pentane, isopentane, and cyclopentane.  Isopentane and n-pentane are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule with a 10,000 pound threshold.  Cyclopentane is not regulated under the RMP Rule.  Hunter Panels is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in 29 CFR 1910.119 for all three isomers of pentane and maintains one plan to meet both the RMP and PSM requirements.\n\nThe facility receives a liquid pentane blend via tank truck and stores it in a 25,000-gallon aboveground pressure vessel for use in the production process.  This volume equates to a pentane material storage capacity of 131,000 to 148,000 pounds depending upon which pentane blend is used.  Throughout the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) documentation at the facility the combination of various isomers of pentane is simply referred to as pentane.  No distinction is made to exclude a possible cyclopentane portion of the blend from the RMP component of the regulations.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan submittal a ma"

At Hunter Panels the worst case scenario would be the vaporization and subsequent detonation of the entire contents of the 25,000 gallon pentane storage tank.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.\n\nThe information in the \u00bfOff-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance\u00bf was used to estimate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this release scenario.  The distance to the endpoint was determined using Reference Table 13 in this guidance document to be approximately 0.45 miles.  This may affect neighboring business facilities, commercial centers, the Northeast Center for Special Care (Head Trauma Center), and residential areas.  The estimated residential population that would be affected is 65 people.\n\nAn alternate case release scenario with possible off-site impacts is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE).  A BLEVE could be caused by a leak of pentane into the tank containment, subsequent ignition of the material in the containment, and explosion of the tank due to fire.  If the entire capacity of the tank, 131,000-148,000 pounds, were involved in the explosion, the duration of the fireball is estimated at 16.4 seconds.  The distance at which exposure for duration of the fireball may cause second degree burns is estimated based on Reference Table 30 in the \u00bfOff-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance\u00bf at 0.45 miles.  This may affect neighboring business facilities, commercial centers, the Northeast Center for Special Care (Head Trauma Center), and residential areas.  The estimated residential population that would be affected is 65 people.\n\nHunter Panels has taken precautions to ensure that the potential for an incident involving pentane is minimal.  Prevention measures include a comprehensive preventive maintenance program, detailed unloading procedures, daily inspections, extensive operator training, and pre-startup inspections for the pentane process.
