If an emergency should happen, we would notify the Dysart Fire Dept. to respond to the emergency.\nThis facility is a farm cooperative.  We offer fertilizer, chemicals, feed, seed, and grain storage to the farm community in Tama and Benton Counties.  Anhydrous Ammonia is one of the fertilizers we offer to our growers.  We have a 30,000 and a 26,000 with 25 1000 gallon nurse tanks and valves, pipes, and hoses to go with them.  The worst case scenario is failure of our 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in a vapor explosion.  The distance to the end point is 4.4 miles.  There are office buildings, retail stores, schools, nursing home and private homes within this distance.  The population within this end point is about 1250 people.  The Anhydrous Ammonia system is maintained in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and state law.  Our facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and state and local regulations. \nIn the past five years, we have never had an accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or evacuations.  In the event of an emergency involving our Anhydrous Ammonia tank it is our policy to notify the Dysart Fire Dept.  We have discussed this policy with our fire department.  Our fire dept. inspects our facility once a year.\nAn alternative Scenario would be if a hose were to break, we have emergency shutoff valves on both ends of the hose.  Another would be if there were to be a valve break, we have an emergency hand shutoff valve that we are able to shut off from the other end of the storage tank.\nAdministrative controls include locks on main storage valves, a dusk to dawn flood light, and valve locks on nurse tanks.   We also installed cement barriers arount the outside of the storage tanks and posts filled with c"
