CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with  HUNTSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous),Aqua Ammonia  and Formaldehyde. The Sulfur Dioxide, Aqua Ammonia, Formaldehyde and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide,  Aqua Ammonia and Formaldehyde are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 17,881 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Aqua Ammonia and Formaldehyde  are present at our facility in quantities of 49,850 lbs., 20,575 lbs.  and 49,601 lbs. respectively.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as SAFER/TRACE.

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.60 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes.   With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.70 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 150 lb. SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.90 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release for Aqua Ammonia involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage. The scenario involves the release of 2,480 lb. of Aqua Ammonia in liquid form over  4.0  minutes. With class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.30 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3,721 lb. of Formaldehyde  in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes.
