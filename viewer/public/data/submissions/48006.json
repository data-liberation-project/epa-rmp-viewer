              "Description": "\n \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION  \n\nThe Atlas Cold Storage hazardous material release Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems.  The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME,  Pressure Vessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of construction.  In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency.  Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency shut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they  become emergencies.\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario.  The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") study helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safey and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases.  Lock-out/tag-out procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\nSpill containment and clean-up training is important so that effects of a spill are minimized.  \n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures.  \n\nSafety Audits include evaluations and recommendations for updating and improving the program.",

The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Action Plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\n\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at any Atlas Cold Sorage facilities, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\n\nThe management believes that cooperative emergency response with company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in will provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all personnel are instructed to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander. \n \n\nAtlas Cold Storage St Louis is a refrigerated warehousing facility. The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 18,350  pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.\n\nAtlas Cold Storage is committed to safe management "
