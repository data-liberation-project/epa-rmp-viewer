This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\nEmployees who enter the Delta facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators\u00bf problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release on our employees, surrounding community and the environment.  As an integral part of the Emergency Action Plan, our facility actively participates in the dome storage area mutual response group, Petal Dome Mutual Aid.\n\nPetal Dome Mutual Aid (PDMA) is made up of eight LP-Gas and natural gas facilities and transportation companies operating in the immediate area.  PDMA was established in the late 1970\u00bfs and along with the Forrest County Emergency Management District, Civil Defense, has successfully worked with the surrounding community emergency response agencies and local and state governmental ag"

The facility consists of four 30,000 gallon \u00bf 33,000 gallon LPG storage tanks, one 2,400 gallon tank, truck and rail loading/unloading stations and related pumps, compressors, valves and piping.  Propane and butane are the regulated substances handled and stored in this process.  There are no toxic substances present at the plant.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nWe have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  Essentially, the facility complies with the EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes/regulations.  This liquefied petroleum facility is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state laws.  Also, the Delta facility has in place an active SPCC plan developed in accordance with 40 CFR 112.7 and a Process Safety Management program in accordance with CFR 29 1910.119.\n\nWe have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Forrest County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Delta Gas Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Petal Fire Department, Forrest County Sheriff Department, Petal Police Department, Forrest County Emergency Management District (EMD), AAA Ambulance, Mississippi State Highway Patrol (MHP), and Hazardous Incident Report Team (HIRT).  The Delta Facility manager is ultimately responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Delta Facility in Petal, MS.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase o"
