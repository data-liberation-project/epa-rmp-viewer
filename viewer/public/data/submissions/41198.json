      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at Dynea USA, Inc, Winnfield, Louisiana facility, incorporates a Risk management Plan that assimilates the following elements:\n\nHEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY POLICY \n\nDynea's long-term development is secured through the way we handle Health, Safety, Environment and Quality matters. This policy is for us the basis trust between Dynea and our stakeholders. \n\nWe will \n- ensure that health and safety are our first priority; \n- minimise harmful environmental impacts; \n- base our work on openness and continuous improvement; \n- develop products, services and operations with consistent quality, which are environmentally preferred and safe; \n- implement this policy according to the agreed health, safety, environment and quality management system based on ISO or equivalent standards.\n\nWe review our performance against our objectives and targets and update the Environmental Management System as appropriate.\n\nThis policy shall be communicated to all employees and made available to the public.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activities at Dynea are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced from the processing of methanol delivered to the plant via rail car.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 125,000 gallons at a concentration of 54% by weight.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Dynea are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM-required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Dynea' program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Dynea's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-start"

      "SummaryText": "up review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternative case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nDynea has had no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.  However, Dynea has had one accidental release that resulted in the loss of product and property damage resulting from \"uncontrolled/runaway reactions\".  This accidental release occurred in May of 1999, and involved reactor K-5W.  This accident was considered when the worst case scenario was reviewed.  However, since the toxic endpoint and the severity of the K-5W accidental release was less than the worst case scenario and the alternative worst case scenario, the worst case and alternative worst case will remain the same.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nDynea has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Dynea to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.  Dynea employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review re"
