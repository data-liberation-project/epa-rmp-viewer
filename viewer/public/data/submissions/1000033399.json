      "SummaryText": "1.    Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Growers Ag Service (GAS), Yuba City Facility (herein referred to as the Facility or GAS) at 2100 Everglade Road, Yuba City, California 95993 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n?    The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n?    Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, converted, stored, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  \n\n?    Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in either a 15,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) or a 18,000-gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 144,177 pounds.\n\n?    Aqua ammonia is produced from anhydrous ammonia or received by truck and stored in five storage tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 312,556 gallons or 2,406,681 pounds.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 78,642 pounds of anhydrous ammonia; this represents the volume of the largest storage tank limited at 85% of capacity.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe with an increased wind speed an"

The worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount and would release 1,690,150 pounds of aqua ammonia primarily within a secondary containment.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  GAS ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on January 25, 2013.\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on January 23, 2013.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised in March 2, 2013.\n\nTraining:  The GAS Facility staff, as well as Tremont corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed on March 4, 2013.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n?    Initial employee training;\n\n?    Periodic refresher training;\n\n?    Training provided as a result of a n"

Training records for each employee.\n\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted in September 27, 2012 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in April 2012.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on March 8, 2012.\n\nIncident Investigation:  An incident investigation program is in place at the Facility and incident investigations would be implemented if needed.\n\nIn addition to the prevention program elements described above, the following chemical-specific prevention steps have been implemented.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility implements the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\".\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia during the last five years resulting in death, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage.\n\n6.
