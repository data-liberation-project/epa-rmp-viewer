Rail Terminal facility, we handle propylene, which is considered a hazardous flammable gas by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propylene to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle propylene combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Gas Sales, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled \n\nThe Martin Gas Sales, Inc. Mont Belvieu Rail Terminal facility stores propylene in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum amount of propylene stored at the facility is administratively limited to 80% of the facility capacity.  Propylene is delivered to the Rail Terminal facility via rail cars and is transferred from the facility via pipeline.  The pipeline runs between the Martin Rail Terminal fa"

Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at our Rail Terminal facility is propylene.  The maximum quantity of propylene that can be stored at this facility is 400,000 pounds. \n The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has incorporated a company policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propylene storage tanks to 80% at 60:F.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 140,000 pounds of propylene from a 34,000-gallon rail car.\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp, the EPA recommended software.  Based on 140,000 pounds of propylene released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.4-mile from the location of the rail car.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario an"

Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternate release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is a the failure of a flexible transfer hose. The release would be limited to the amount of propylene in the transfer line, the loading rack manifold, and the iron piping between the rail car and the storage tanks.  Excess flow valves at the storage tank and rail car function to stop the flow of propylene out of the storage tank and rail car.  Therefore, the propylene released would be limited to 8,200 pounds of propylene, the amount in the transfer hose and iron piping.\n\nThe scenario assumes the entire quantity of propylene in the transfer hose and iron piping is released.  RMP*Comp estimates the distance endpoint for the release of 8,200 pounds of propylene as 0.1-mile.  The hazard endpoint extends offsite.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nOur Rail Terminal facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule,  EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the propylene process.\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our propylene process are identified and controlled efficiently.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n    Training\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the propylene process. \n\n    Mechanical Integrity\nThe Rail Terminal facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.
