If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmer.  The maximum quantity stored in this area would be approximately 113,000 pounds.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release  scenario would be the release of the total contents of the bulk storage tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 44,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is approximatgely 2.3 miles.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61,\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  And the Standard of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY"
