The WWTP operates on a 24-hour, 7-day per week schedule.  To reduce the impact a release during handling could have on the community and the environment, it is Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to changeout chlorine containers/cylinders only during the first shift (6:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.) Monday through Friday when the majority of personnel are present at the facility.\r\n\r\nA new wind sock was placed on top of the Chlorine Building in 2003 to check wind direction should a release occur.  A loud audible leak alarm inside the building is tied into the plant paging system and, if activated, will set off a red flashing light located on top of the Chlorine Building, as well as the light on the alarm panel in Building 2 (main office building). Automatic shut-offs for one (1) ton containers were purchased in 2000 to help control a leak once detected.  The automatic shut-offs consist of a racheting system that automatically closes the containers' valves.\r\n\r\nThe WWTP's Risk Management Program consists of a written SOP with written checklists from point of delivery of chlorine into the facility through changing of empty cylinders/containers with full cylinders/containers, and placement of the empties at a specific location at the Chlorination Building.\r\n\r\nThe Milton WWTP Chlorine Standard Operating Procedure includes written direction for inspection of all incoming chlorine containers/cylinders for appropriate PA DOT tags, new lead washers, and corrosion.

This weight is also recorded on the Daily Operations Sheets once per day.  Management personnel review this inventory on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nOur most recent training was held on March 7, 2013.  This training includes safe handling procedures, review of the handling SOP, application of Chlorine \"A\" and \"B\" kits, and general first aid for chlorine exposure. Employee participation in training seminars outside the facility is encouraged by plant management.\r\n\r\nDue to this comprehensive training program, detailed safety policies and procedures, and experience of the operators, the Milton Wastewater Treatment Plant has experienced no reportable chlorine leaks over the past five years.\r\n\r\nAs per EPA's Risk Management Programs Regulation, 40 CFR Part 68, the Milton WWTP complies with OSHA's Emergency Action Plan Regulation 29 CFR Part 1920.38.  Guidance from the Chlorine Institute, Water Environment Federation and the New York State Chlorine Manuals have been instrumental in the development of all chlorine related policies and procedures.  \r\n\r\nShould an accidental release occur at any time, the WWTP SOP specifically addresses a Level I release and a Level II release.

The \"B\" Kit and personal protective equipment are readily available should an incident escalate to a Level II situation involving assistance from trained emergency response personnel.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative worst case senario would entail a one-ton container leak inside the Chlorine room.  Passive mitigation is present in that the leak would be contained within the room.  The automatic ventilation system would be shut down and the chlorine would be dispersed by ventilation dilution at a controlled rate by trained haz mat personnel from outside the facility.\r\n\r\nIn April 1996 a coordinated effort with WWTP personnel, local fire companies and the emergency medical service held a simulated chlorine leak drill combined with a confined space rescue.  The response time from the time the 911 call was placed until the container \"leak\" was stopped was 42 minutes.  This drill impressed upon every participant the importance of a trained response from all collective participants.
