The resin will then be used to make finished composite wood products at the facility.\n\nPaneltech is committed to the safety of its workers and to being a good neighbor and corporate citizen.  As such, we have taken certain steps to ensure the safety of our employees and the community while we expand our operations.\n\nThe new resin process falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules since it uses formaldehyde solution, a listed chemical.  These regulations require Paneltech to design safety into the new resin process by:\n*  Reviewing the safety of the process to identify potential problem areas and remetiate them prior to startup\n*  Developing a program for inspecting and maintining process equipment \n*  Instituting a training program for workers\n*  Managing changes to the process, including reviewing design and operational changes, removing any potential problem areas and training all affected employees on the changes\n*  Develop and maintain information on the resin process, including key process parameters and operating instructions\n*  Determine the impacts of a worst-case release on the community\n*  Develop an emergency response plan and coordinate with local responders, such as the Hoquiam Fire Department\n*  Put in place a process of continuous review and improvement to identify and mitigate potential process problems\n\nPaneltech has taken several steps to ensure the safety of the formaldehyde / resin system, including:\n\n*  Use of administrative controls and level alarms to prevent tank overfills\n*  Installation and maintenance of industry-standard pressure and vacuum relief devices\n*  Operation of a vapor incinerator to resuce emissions of formaldehyde during normal and emergency conditions\n*  Installation of barrier walls around the "
