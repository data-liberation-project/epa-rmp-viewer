If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Richmond Fire Department (RFD), and the National Response Center and Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), as necessary.\n\nFacility description and the regulated substance:  Carpenter Industries is a manufacturer of buses and related motor vehicles, employing approximately 550 people.  Propane is used only as a backup fuel source in the event that the natural gas source is interrupted.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst-case scenario for Carpenter Industries is failure of a 20,000 gallon above-ground storage tank containing propane.  The facility cannot store more than 17,600 gallons in the tank.  A vapor cloud explosion of this tank would result in an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.  A total of approximately 300 people would potentially be affected.\n\nThe prevention program:  Carpenter Industries complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and applicable state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  Franklin Electric has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Wayne County LEPC, the RFD and the appropriate state and national entities.  The RFD has a copy of the emergency resp"
