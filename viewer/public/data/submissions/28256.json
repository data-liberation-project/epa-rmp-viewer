In facilities which use flammable regulated substances, U.S. EPA defines the worst case scenario for a catastrophic release to be 1 pound per square inch (psi) over-pressure as a result of an instantaneous release of the largest tank volume utilizing no active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under worst-case weather conditions.   U.S. EPA defines alternative release scenarios as 1-psi over-pressure as a result of a timed release of a portion of the largest tank volume utilizing active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under neutral weather conditions.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenario for the particular regulated substance and conditions at this facility, we used equations from Appendix D of the U.S. EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute, a simplified EPA model based on the EPA\u00bfs Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For analysis of alternative release scenarios, we also employed the equations provided by the USEPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe activities at the plant can be categorized by Program 3 of the RMP guidance.  The projected worst-case release scenario would involve a catastrophic release from the butane storage.  The scenario involves the release of 75,000 pounds of butane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes were not considered when evaluating this scenario.  The worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire quantity of the butane storage tank is released as a vapor, an ignition source is present and 10 percent of the released quantity participates in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance (corresponding to an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure) results in the potential to affect businesses, residences, hospital"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a potential release from reoccurring.  Reports are kept for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPactiv truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Many employees participate in safety initiatives within the plant.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Pactiv Corporation - Yakima, WA are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the covered process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of the process involving a regulated substance.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations that provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products (such as trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket) and building insulation materials.  We have one substance present at our facility that is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is butane; and is referenced in this document by the term regulated substance.  The regulated substance at our facility is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  These products are also often called blowing agents or expansion agents\u00bf.\n\nThe maximum inventory of butane possible at our facility is approximately 75,000 pounds. Written operating procedures and administrative controls prevent more than this amount from being present in this tank.  \n\n3.
