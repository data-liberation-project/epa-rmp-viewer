The City has two full time employees in which all are trained in chlorine safety and how to handle any accidental release of chlorine. The two operators of the water wells have one self-contained air packs and are trained in how to handle any release of chlorine.  Also the City of Forest Fire Dept. has one complete ton emergency repair kit and the fire fighters are trained in how to handle a chlorine release.  The Fire Dept. is trained to put up a water curtain if needed to contain the release as much as possible.  We also have a chlorine sensor and alarm to alert the operator with the use of an automated dailer that dials pagers.  Also we have two more complete ton chlorine cyclinder repair kits with four additional self contained air packs.  The operator at the plant checks all of the chlorination system at least daily.  If we have a release that requires people to evacuate for a certain area we use the police dept. and all forces to accomplish this action."
