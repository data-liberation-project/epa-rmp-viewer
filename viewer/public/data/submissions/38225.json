      "SummaryText": "established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nSacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection, dechlorination, and methane gas production process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant's operations.  The Maximo Computerized Maintenance Management System is used as a management tool for the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  Virtual Work Orders are created to track completion of committed items.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, fabrication of custom gauge connection nipples for liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide pressure gauges to limit the rate of liquid release should the gauge fail, installation of an additional digester gas flare, increased security, and creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas systems.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or digester gas at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas has been coordinated with Sacramento"

Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains First Responder capability with respect to hazardous materials releases.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."

      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has instituted a Risk Management Program for their wastewater treatment facility, Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68.  The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, and from the City of Folsom.  It is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd.  The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas.  There are 300 full-time employees at this site.  The Plant treats 165 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) on average.  \n\nThe Plant uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination and maintains quantities of these RS's greater than the Federal threshold quantities.  Additionally, methane gas, an"

      "SummaryText": "RS, is held in the digester gas system in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity.  \n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems generally consist of railcar receiving, liquid chemical withdrawal from railcars, bulk sulfur dioxide liquid storage, liquid chemical vaporization, and gaseous chemical metering and dissolving into water for ultimate application to various points in the wastewater treatment process.  \n\nSolids removed in the wastewater treatment process are introduced into the 11 anaerobic digesters at the Plant.  Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is formed in the digesters as bacterial digestion proceeds.  The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, stored in low pressure and high pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used to generate electricity and steam.  Whatever quantity of digester gas which cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is flared.  The entire inventory of digester gas in the plant must be considered for the purpose of comparisin with Federal threshold quantity.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the handling of methane, at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of these RS's to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has gathered safety information on chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane, and on the process, equipment and procedures involving these RS's; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios;"
