      "SummaryText": "Carpenter Co., Conover, NC was built, in 1972, to produce comfort cushioning for the home furnishings industry.  The flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing process has been expanded  and modified several times over the years in order to improve the process, both with respect to equipment and with respect to chemistry, to conform to changing government regulations, and to meet ever increasing and changing needs of our customers.  It is this process that is subject to RMP requirements.  Bonded and un-bonded fiber batting is also manufactured and foam is fabricated at this facility.\n\nThe original Risk Management Program (RMP) for Carpenter Co., Conover was prepared and submitted in June 1999.  Federal regulations in 40 CFR Part 68 requires a periodic review and resubmittal when significant changes are made and a mandatory resubmittal is required every 5 years.  The 5 year resubmittal was prepared and submitted to the EPA in electronic form in June of 2004.  In 2006, a new pouring line was constructed and began operation on July 12, 2006.  The old line remained as a specialty production line for foams that could not, at that time, be manufactured on the new line.  The RMP was revised and resubmitted in March of 2007 to reflect the addition of this new line to the pouring process.\n  \nThrough continuous process and formulation development, the new line is now capable of producing all foams in our product line. The old line, the only process using our sole Program Level 3 material A? pentane, produced its last batch of foam on April 3, 2009 and is being scrapped.  The pentane supply was removed from our tank on July 9, 2009.  Therefore, the only remaining RMP regulated substance is toluene diisocyanate (TDI A? an 80%/20% mix of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomers) on the new line.\n\nWhile much of the process, facility and regulatory information remains the same, the removal of the old line and pentane is a significant change, under the RMP rule, necessitating an RMP resubmission refl"

      "SummaryText": "ecting the change from Program 3.  As this facility has not had a TDI release in the past 5 years, this now qualifies the facility for Program 1 status.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nCarpenter Co. is committed to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals, toxic or otherwise. Furthermore, Carpenter Co. is committed to protecting the health and welfare of its employees and community residents - as well as protecting the environment.\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co., Conover has been developed and is located in the Contingency Plan.  This plan includes the procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies when an accidental release occurs, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposure, and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nCarpenter Co., Conover is located at 2009 Keisler Road, SE and manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in furniture, bedding and other applications.  The manufacturing process incorporates the use of TDI as a reactant to produce the foam product.\n\nTDI is received primarily via railcars which hold approximately 190,000 lbs although tank trucks may be used if conditions warrant.  When required, the rail carrier moves the railcar from an outside holding area to the indoor unloading area.  Transfer hoses and associated equipment are connected and the unloading process is initiated.  TDI is transferred from the railcar to three 12,000 gallon storage tanks located in the interior tank farm near the pouring station.  From these tanks, TDI is transferred to a 30,000 gallon tank which feeds the pouring process.  All 4 TDI tanks are located "

      "SummaryText": "in concrete secondary containment.  TDI is pumped from the storage tanks to the pouring lines through a strainer, filter and heat exchanger prior to entry into the mix head.  In the mix head, TDI is combined with polyol, CO2 (for some foams), water and other minor raw materials to initiate the foam production reaction.\n\n3.The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable North Carolina requirements.  Carpenter, Conover's Risk Management Program (when a Level 3) has been the subject of two dedicated inspections by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources - Division of Air Quality, the last in December of 2005, and found to be in complete compliance with this rule.  Personnel training with protective equipment and practice drills for emergencies and spill response are an important part of our safety and preventive measures.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History.\n\nCarpenter Co., Conover has not had any TDI releases in the past five years. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nAn Emergency Response procedure for Carpenter Co. Conover has been developed and is located in the Contingency Plan.  This plan includes the procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies when an accidental release occurs, documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposure, and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nEmployees are regularly scheduled for Hazardous Materials Handling training as well as spill drills.  Emergency response training for the employees identified as responders is conducted regularly.  Also, numerous safety topics are addressed and discussed which promotes and emphasizes the importance of safety awareness at Carpenter."
