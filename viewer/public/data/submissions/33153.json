      "SummaryText": "The DSM Belvidere facility is an important manufacturing facility for DSM Nutritional Products, Inc.  The principal activity at the site is the production of bulk Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).  But the facility also produces bulk quantities of sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, and sodium sulfate (a byproduct of the Ascorbic Acid process), and arachidonic acid (a nutraceutical).  The facility also processes, in custom blending operations and spray drying operations, less-than-bulk quantities of Vitamins A, D3, E, B1, B2, B6, B12, biotin, and betacarotene.  \r\n\r\nThe facility was established on a 500-acre site bordering the Delaware River in rural Warren County, New Jersey in the late 1960s.  Today, DSM Belvidere includes over 50 major buildings and 30 ancillary buildings of which 7 are in bulk chemical production and 6 are in custom vitamin mixes and spray drying blends.  The site also includes a complete utility infrastructure including potable and process water treatment, water distribution, and wastewater treatment, electricity generation, and steam generation.\r\n\r\nThe DSM Belvidere facility uses approximately 840,000 pounds of Chloroform (CAS #67-66-3) within Step 5 of the Ascorbic Acid production process.  Approximately 341,000 pounds can be stored in the largest vessel within the process.\r\n\r\nChloroform is an important basic chemical in the global chemical industry.  It is ranked within the top 50 production chemicals in the United States.  The DSM Belvidere site uses chloroform as a carrier within the Step 5 rearrangement portion of the process.  In order for the reaction to take place and for crude ascorbic acid to be produced, the rearrangement process must be free of water.  The chloroform allows the material to be pumped and processed without water interfering in the reaction.  After the rearrangement reaction and the production of crude ascorbic acid, the chloroform is separated from the solid ascorbic acid and processed through a solvent recovery system.  T"

In this manner, chloroform is conserved and recycled thus limiting the number of deliveries of pure chloroform. \r\n\r\nChloroform is a colorless, nonflammable liquid with a strong solvent-like odor.  Chloroform vapor is extremely irritating to the eyes, throat, and respiratory system, even in low concentrations.  This irritation acts as a warning property to avoid higher concentrations.  In high concentrations, chloroform can cause serious problems such as difficult and painful breathing, convulsions, and in extremely high doses, even death.  Repeated exposures may cause other chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nDSM Belvidere uses a variety of safety equipment, procedures, and control devices to prevent accidental releases of chloroform.  The site uses a complete system of administrative controls to ensure the system is designed safely and remains safe during operation including a management of change system that prevents changes from occurring without the proper technical and management review.  The site performs process hazard analyses on all process equipment containing chloroform.  This allows for a detailed review of the existing system.  A team of engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, and safety experts evaluates the system and makes recommendations for operational and safety improvements.  Prior to start-up of any significant changes to the system the site performs a prestart-up safety review to ensure that all changes have been properly documented and any changes to drawings, operating or maintenance procedures, and training have been completed.  Operators and maintenance personnel receive extensive training to ensure proper operation of the system.  Maintenance procedures have been developed to ensure that the system can perform its function properly.  Deficiencies found during preventive maintenance inspections are corrected within reasonable periods.\r\n\r\nMonitors and alarms are employed throughout th"

Devices such as temperature monitors and switches, pressure monitors and switches, and level monitors and switches provide immediate feedback and have the capability to safely shutdown the system prior to the development of an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe Belvidere site employees approximately 100 contractor personnel at any one time.  Entry of these contractors into process areas containing chloroform is strictly controlled.  Contractors may not enter the process area until they have been evaluated on their safety performance and fully trained.  \r\n\r\nIf an emergency situation were to arise, relief devices are located throughout the system to safely relieve excess pressure without catastrophic losses of chloroform.  If a spill were to occur, the Belvidere site maintains a staff of fully-trained emergency responders who can quickly stop the release, contain the release, and clean up any released material quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe DSM Belvidere facility has had no reportable releases of chloroform in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe defined worst-case scenario involving chloroform at the Belvidere facility is a release of 341,000 pounds of chloroform from a storage tank into a diked area over a 10-minute period.  Given these parameters, the site used the DEGADIS Air Dispersion Model to determine the extent of the impact of this release.  The DEGADIS model determined that a release of this type would have no adverse or permanent impact outside of DSM property."
