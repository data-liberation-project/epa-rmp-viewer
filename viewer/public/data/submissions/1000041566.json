Box 399\r\nLockport, LA 70374\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\n2014 Update\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary:  South Treatment Plant\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your site\r\n\r\nDue to regulations under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the District has developed a Risk Management Plan for Chlorine gas.  The requirements involve instituting a prevention plan to avoid unnecessary Chlorine leaks in addition to developing, revising, and updating its existing emergency response procedures.  The expectations of the above mentioned requirements are to allow minimal injury and damage to occur, as well as to provide aid and guidance for other responders in the event of an accident.\r\n\r\nThe prevention plan, developed by the District, has been designed to ensure that all precautions are taken so as to prevent and mitigate any possible Chlorine release.  One element of this plan is to assess the Chlorine process for potential hazards that could contribute to a leak then correct the problems immediately.  Another essential component is written operating procedures for all duties associated with Chlorine, while another is to provide proper training to employees involved in those duties.  All training and inspection information will be documented for future reference.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response plan was implemented with the intention that plant personnel will respond, contain and repair all Chlorine leaks.  One reason for this is because we feel our employees are properly trained and experienced enough to resolve the problem in a timely manner.  Another reason is because plant policy only allows Chlorine cylinders to be handled only during normal working hours so an adequate amount of qualified responders are present to initiate a response if necessary.  Nonetheless, it is possible to have a release after hours, even though, because two people are on site at all times they will be able mitigate to the situatio"

The physical address is 5753 Highway 308, Lockport. \r\nBackground Information (South)\r\nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1 - South Plant is a potable drinking water production facility.  The District purifies water taken from Bayou Lafourche and distributes the water to customers throughout Lafourche Parish. \r\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process and is stored, handled, moved, and fed continuously.  The District has one (1) ton cylinders on site.  Plant personnel remove one (1) ton cylinders when empty and replace them with full cylinders.  This involves transporting cylinders with a forklift, lifting the cylinders with a hoist, and mounting a regulator onto the cylinder valve.  All of which is done during normal working hours in order to reduce potential leaks from occurring after hours.      \r\nDistrict personnel can deal with most emergency response and repair situations; however, outside assistance may be necessary depending on the severity of the Chlorine leak. PPE and repair equipment used to respond to Chlorine releases are provided and stored in a dedicated Emergency Response area.  B repair kits, portable SCBAs, Level B containment suits, gloves, and extra air bottles can be found in an Emergency Response Cart in this Emergency Response area.  The Level A containment suits are located in a cabinet in the Emergency Response area as well.  There are four (4) Self Contained Breathing Apparatus located at the South Plant.  Two are located on the first floor in the plant foyer, and the other two are portable units located in the emergency response cart.       \r\nSugarcane and pastureland surround the plant on three sides with LA Highway 308 on the other.

Generally, a major Chlorine release will last at most 30-40 minutes; therefore, shelter-in-place will more than likely be used in an emergency situation.  If shelter-in-place is initiated, all air conditioning must be shut off and all vents, windows, and doors closed.  In addition, office personnel shall keep customers from leaving during this time.  Office personnel should listen for further advisories.\r\nOffice personnel will be prepared to evacuate the premises on short notice.  Evacuation will be utilized if there is a massive quantity of Chlorine released or if the wind direction threatens the assembly area. \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Notification\r\n\r\nIf outside assistance is required, the Sheriff's Office, State Police, and the Fire Department will be notified. Evacuation or shelter-in-place of residences will be at the discretion of the Law Enforcement Agencies. These agencies may choose to shelter residences within \u00bd mile of the plant.

In this event, the total quantity released is 2000 pounds with the release rate being 200 pounds per minute.  The variables used in determining the distance that the gas travels is a rural topography, an F-stability class (atmosphere conditions), and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  When these conditions exist, the toxic endpoint is 3.04 miles according to the ALOHA model, CLW-2, in Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  The population affected by this scenario is approximately 8,900 people.  No environmental receptors would be affected in such a case; however, schools, recreational areas, businesses, residences, and a hospital are within the 3.04 mile endpoint.  For this reason, it is crucial that extreme precautions be taken to prevent this from ever occurring.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario (ACS)\r\n\r\nThe most likely case scenario of a Chlorine gas release for Lafourche Parish Water District #1 is a malfunctioning valve on the cylinder itself.  Using the ALOHA model, CLA-3, in Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, the release rate for a malfunctioning valve is 10.5 pounds per minute.  Because this scenario will tend to occur during normal working hours, as explained above, the time taken to repair the leak will be minimal.  It is estimated that it takes approximately sixty (60) minutes to repair a leak such as this.  Accordingly, this would allow 317 pounds of chlorine to be expelled.  The variables used in determining the distance that the gas travels is a rural topography, an F-stability class (atmospheric conditions), and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  When these conditions exist, the toxic endpoint is 0.57 miles according to"

      "SummaryText": "che Parish Water District No. 1 has not had an accidental release of Chlorine over the last five years that resulted in death, injury, property damage (on or off site), evacuation, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the goal of our emergency response program is to effectively respond to Chlorine leaks allowing minimal injury or damage to occur.  It will also aid other emergency response personnel by providing guidance in the event of an accident.  Some of the elements of this plan are referenced below.\r\n\r\nAlarm\r\n\r\nA Chlorine leak detector sounds an alarm when elevated Chlorine concentrations are found.  The Chlorine alarm will sound continuously for the duration of the abnormal concentrations.  It will not silence until the Chlorine leak is repaired and/or the concentrations have fallen. All employees, contractors, visitors, etc. should exit the leak area while observing the wind direction and immediately report to their designated primary assembly area as noted in the next section.  The Ranking Supervisor for the Purification Department shall proceed with the Emergency Response Coordination. \r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly Area\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the Chlorine alarm, all purification personnel should immediately report to the Lab/Control Room.  If it is inaccessible, they should then report to an area in the yard that is upwind of the leak.  A windsock is located on the plant roof and on top of the lime silo for determining wind direction.\r\nPurification Department:\r\nPrimary  \tLab/Control Room\r\nSecondary \tDesignated by wind direction\r\n\r\nAdministration personnel, distribution personnel, contractors, visitors, etc. should immediately report to their primary assembly area as long as it appears safe.  Otherwise, they should report to their secondary assembly area as described below.\r\n\t\tOthers:\r\n\t\tPrimary\tExit Gate (upwind of leak)\r\n\t\tSecondary\tArea designated by wind direction\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall Emergency Response Coordination\r\nAfter gath"

      "SummaryText": "explained in the section above, the Leak Assessment phase, and the Leak Repair phase.  Even though the Coordination phase can begin immediately, the other phases cannot begin until a minimum number of responders are present.  The Leak Assessment requires there to be at least three (3) responders on site and the Leak Repair requires at least four (4) responders.    \r\nA personal protective equipment SOP is available.  Also, an explanation and supporting documentation regarding recommended chemical suits are provided.\r\n\r\n \r\nAfter Hours\r\n\r\nPurification Department day workers normal working hours are 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday; otherwise, there are two people operating the plant at all times.  Plant policy allows handling of Chlorine cylinders only during normal working hours in order that sufficient workers are present in case an emergency response is initiated.  If an emergency situation arises after hours, the man on standby and any other supervisor available shall be contacted and notified of the situation.  These supervisors shall report to the plant immediately to assist in the Emergency Response.  The Ranking Supervisor will use discretion when calling on outside assistance, although he is required to notify specific agencies if a Chlorine leak threatens to have offsite impact or exceeds a ten (10) pound release. \r\n\r\nOutside Assistance  (Offsite Impact or 10 pound Chlorine leak)\r\n\r\nWhen a Chlorine leak threatens to have an offsite impact or is known to be greater than 10 pounds, the Ranking Supervisor is required to contact the following agencies:\r\nLaf.
