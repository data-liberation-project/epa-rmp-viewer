The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) addressing ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP and trained in the evacuation procedure.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will investigate the issue and contact the fire department for assistance as needed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nWoodbridge Winery reviews the ammonia refrigeration systems for opportunities to improve on system operations and safety. In 2020-2023, the facility completed a refrigeration controls upgrade for Plants 1, 2, and 3, which included the installation of new compressor panels and additional safety systems such ammonia detectors with horns/strobes and emergency stop switches. In 2021, the pressure relief system for all three ammonia systems was modified to include hydrostatic relief valves on the compressor oil coolers and re-seating relief regulators for the transfer pumps associated with the Liquid Transfer Units. These relief devices were installed to provide protection against hydrostatic pressure buildup and rupture of equipment and piping. The facility also installed an ammonia detector with ho"

These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety controls to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nAccording to the EPA and CalARP regulations, the five year accident history covers only certain releases:\n1) The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.  \n2) The release must have caused at lea"

Since its inception, it has been committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations and maintenance.  Woodbridge Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nWoodbridge Winery is located at 5950 East Woodbridge Road in Acampo, California.
