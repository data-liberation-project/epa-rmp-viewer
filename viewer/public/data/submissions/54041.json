We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and the communities in which we do business.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Twin Oaks Facility, located in Bremond, TX, is a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for reduction in NOx (nitrous oxides) emissions from their stack gases.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in one dedicated, specially designed storage tank.  The storage tank is supplied with anhydrous ammonia on demand.  The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis (OCA)\nPlease refer to OCA data located onsite at the Twin Oaks Facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Twin Oaks Facility is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at this facility includes:\n\nEmployee Participation\nAll Twin Oaks Facility employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThe Twin Oaks Facility maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI data is updated when changes in the process occur.  Information concerning the hazards of ammon"

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Twin Oaks Facility maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations. The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations. Th"
