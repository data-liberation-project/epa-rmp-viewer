Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nS.D. Warren Company is committed to operating its integrated pulp and paper mill in Skowhegan, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and employee safety, S.D Warren has developed and implemented numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  S. D. Warren has also developed and implements a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the mill.  Many of these programs have been in place since the late 1980\u0012s. \n\nS.D. Warren believes that safety, health, and environmental protection are essential to the responsible operation of its facilities.  S.D. Warren views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a continuous process.  Consequently, S.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to S.D. Warren\u0012s overall accident prevention and response program is the development of the Somerset mill\u0012s Risk Management Program.  Somerset\u0012s risk management program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA\u0012s) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA.  This document satisfies the requirement by providing the public with information about  processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts at the Somerset mill.

The mill\u0012s RMP program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals complements the existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program which was developed in 1994 under similar rules administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA;\n3. Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the mill is developing a single integrated contingency plan (ICP) that is designed to meet the emergency response planning requirements under a number of applicable state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning laws.\n\nAdditional information regarding how Somerset addresses each of these requirements is summarized below and in the attached RMP.\n\nWhile the RMP program at Somerset helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of Somerset\u0012s comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Maintenance of a fully equipped and trained Hazardous Materials Response Team (Hazmat Team) and Fire Brigade;\n2. Regular employee/contractor safety training;\n3. Participation with and representation on the local emergency planning committee (LEPC);\n4. Coordinated training and drills with the local fire departments;\n5. Periodic table-top and full scale safety and emergency response drills; \n6. Acquisition and maintenance of emergency response and personnel protective equipment; \n7. Development of safe work practices ( e.g. confined space, lockout/tagout; etc.)\n8.

      "SummaryText": "e to estimate potential impacts to the community. Somerset\u0012s off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release and an alternative release.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest tank is released instantaneously.  While it is virtually impossible for an entire 110,000 gallon tank to instantaneously release its contents, the chances of this occurring in Central Maine on a 960F night with the most stable atmospheric conditions and the wind blowing at 3.4 miles per hour are extremely remote.  \n\nUnder the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill for purposes of RMP would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mill\u0012s fence line.  To further mitigate adverse impacts associated with this worst-case release, Somerset is building a new dike around the chlorine dioxide storage tanks that is designed to contain a liquid chlorine dioxide spill and reduce the surface area of the pool of ClO2 in the event of a spill.  The reduced dike surface area will minimize vapor released from such a spill.  The newly constructed dike would reduce the potentially impacted off-site areas by the worst case release by approximately 50%.\n\nAn alternative release focuses on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  After considering all criteria in the RMP rule,"

      "SummaryText": "Somerset chose an alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario modeled a spill of  2,400 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution at 1% concentration. \n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nSomerset has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release from the covered process.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and analogous RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  To comply with the RMP rule, the mill has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focus -- protection of the public.  \n\nThe basic elements of Somerset\u0012s accident prevention program are described below: \n\n1. Employee Participation.  Somerset has developed and implements a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information at the mill.   \n\n2. Process Safety Information.  In accordance with applicable requirements, Somerset has compiled and maintains written process safety information about the design, installation, maintenance, and operation of the covered process.  This ensures that information remains current.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analyses.  Somerset performed  a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the covered process.  The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and Somerset\u0012s RMP accident prevention program.  It is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential hazards posed by the covered process.  \n\nSpecifically, the PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the covered process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the ha"

Forklift training.\n\nIn addition, the mill and all equipment are designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.\n\nS. D. Warren\u0012s commitment to environmental stewardship and providing a safe workplace is demonstrated in its phase-out of elemental chlorine in 1997 and aqueous ammonia at the waste treatment plant in 1998.  In 1999, the mill decreased its propane storage levels by 1/3 in two different locations.  Somerset is also integrating  all of its emergency response and accident prevention plans into a single, easy to use Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is designed to provide more-effective emergency response guidance and to comply with a number of state and federal laws.  \n\nB.  RMP Covered Process and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Somerset mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and fine coated papers.  In 1997 it replaced chlorine in its bleaching process with chlorine dioxide making the process an Elemental Chlorine Free System (ECF).  The only chemical present at the mill in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the RMP rule is chlorine dioxide used in the bleaching process (covered process).  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1% of a liquid mixture that is stored in four 110,000 gallon tanks.  These tanks are protected by a dike that is designed and capable of holding  110% of the single largest storage tank.    In addition to containing a liquid release, the dike is designed to mitigate the adverse impact of any vapor release that could potentially result from a liquid spill of the mixture by reducing the surface area of the exposed liquid.  \n\nAt a concentration of 1%, the total amount of chlorine dioxide stored on-site could be 36,684 pounds.  The amount of chlorine dioxide stored in any single vessel is normally 9,170 pounds.   \n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis is required by the RMP rul"

One employee was treated for a sore throat and coughing as a result of this exposure.\n  \nF. Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nSomerset maintains a fully trained Hazardous Materials Response Team and Fire Brigade that is on-site 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  These teams are capable of minimizing the adverse impact from  reasonably forseeable accidental releases that may occur. \n\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release occurs that is beyond the capabilities of Somerset\u0012s Hazardous Material Response Team and Fire Brigade, the mill has entered into mutual aid agreements with the Skowhegan and Fairfield Fire and Police Departments, Maine General Medical Center and Redington-Fairview General Hospital, and several private emergency response contractors.  The mutual aid agreements allow these entities to respond to emergencies at the mill upon request by Somerset.  The Skowhegan fire Department operates under mutual aid agreements with  the towns of Fairfield, Canaan, Cornville, Anson, Clinton, Norridgewock, and Waterville which ensure that additional  emergency response personnel and equipment are available to respond to a significant release at the mill.\n\nSomerset is developing an Integrated Contingency Plan designed to meet the regulatory requirements of the following federal and state response planning and prevention laws:  \n\n7 OSHA emergency response plan (29 C.F.R. 1910.120(q))\n7 OSHA Process Safety Management emergency response requirements (29 C.F.R.
