This process safety information includes information pertaining to the toxicological and physical hazards of anhydrous ammonia.and the technology of the processes and information pertaining to any equipment used in the processes. \n\nA complete hazard analysis and study of the ammonia system's mechanical integrity has been conducted on the ammonia refrigeration system. This analysis was completed by safety and health staff, engineering, maintenance personnel, and certain operational personnel. The analyses involved a review of each operation of the refrigeration processes to address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. The assessment also included information concerning the emergency action plans related to the process; development and implementation of safe work practices regarding the control of entrance and exit of personnel in the process areas; pre-startup safety; mechanical integrity of equipment; inspection and testing, correction of deficiencies in equipment, planned or unexpected changes to the process, equipment, and procedures to the processes. A system was developed and is maintained to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations. The hazard analyses will be updated as needed and at five (5) year intervals. \n\nBetter Baked Foods, Inc. has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions to maintain the safety of our associates.

Refresher training is required every three years, and more often if necessary. Training includes:  emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations in the case of a release including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks. \n\nA contractor safety program has been developed to address maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to areas where the ammonia is utilized in the facility.

For the hazard assessment and the RMP, populations potentially affected are defined as those within a circle that has as its center the point of release and its radius the distance to the toxic endpoint. Owners or operators may use census data to define this population. The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted. The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed. The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas, that can be exposed to an accidental release. \n\nBetter Baked Foods, Inc. has had NO reportable accidents under the guidelines of the Risk Management Program during the past 5 years.  On July 13th, 2000 a mechanical failures resulted in a break in process piping which released 500 pounds of ammonia into an interior cold storage area.  The leak was contained within seven minutes by onsite responders.  No injuries or environmental damage was reported.\n\nMaintenance of a refrigeration system is an continual process.
