The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Farmers Coop Mill and Elevator, Carnegie, OK are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to  \n   farmers.\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for \n   crop production nutrients.\n            \n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf  The maximum quantity stored would be 218,875 pounds in our 26,000 gallon tank and our \n   two 12,000 gallon tanks, or 220,000 pounds combined. Due to the round requirements of \n   the RMP Submit Program, the 218,875 pounds is rounded to 220,000 pounds\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 113,815 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 113,815 pounds is rounded to 110,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.2 miles. (This distance is rounded to two significant digits).\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n \n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility"

The Five-year Accident History \n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf  To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering \n   in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
