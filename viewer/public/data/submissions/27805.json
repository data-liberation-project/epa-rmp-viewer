      "SummaryText": "Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP), located in Brunswick County, produces electric power for retail distribution.  The plant operates two nuclear reactors for power generation.  The heat from the nuclear reactors is used to generate steam which drives the turbines.  Water which is used for cooling is treated with chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in a fenced-in section adjacent to the service water building.  Other components of the water treatment system are:  evaporators (5), chlorinators (5), and injectors (5).\n\nThere are three locations at BSEP where chlorine is stored on site in railcars above the regulated threshold quantity:\n\n1.  A single chlorine railcar is staged at the chlorination process and is used as a feed tank.\n\n2.  One or more chlorine cars are stored on a rail spur behind the warehouse several hundred yards from the chlorination process.\n\n3.  Railcars are stored for short periods in a locked holding pen near Bethel Church Road.\n\nThe storage of the railcar at the three separate locations constitute three processes since the railcars are not interconnected and are located such that a release at one location would not result in a potential release at another location.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario analysis required by 40 CFR 68.165 was conducted based on Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance issued by EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is the same for all three railcar locations (i.e., all three processes).  The alternative release scenario analysis (which is also identical for the three railcar locations) also required by 40 CFR 68.165 was conducted based on guidance provided by The Chlorine Institute in Pamphlet 74 (Edition 3, April 1998).  The RMP regulations require that the alternative release scenario analysis be based on actual incidents at the facility.  However,  the BSEP has not experienced a chlorine release which had impacts beyond the property.  Therefore, the guidance issued by The Chlorine Institute has been used for the alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnative release scenario analysis.\n\nBrunwick Steam Electric Plant is subject to regulations enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  NRC regulatons require procedures and safe operating practices to minimize health and safety risks (to the employees as well as the public) resulting from exposure to radioactive material as well as other toxic/flammable materials.  With respect to safety inspection performed by an external agency (Item 1.15 of the RMP), as a licensee, BSEP maintains NRC safety requirements.  Consequently, BSEP has developed procedures and safe operating practices for the handling of chlorine at the Plant.  These procedures and safe operating practices have resulted in no accidental release during the past five-year period which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  A process hazards analysis (PHA) conducted in July 1998 indicated that no changes were necessary.\n\nThe RMP*Submit program has flagged the latitude and longitude reported in Section 1 of the RMPas not valid.  However, we have checked the latitude and longitude and the values we have reported are correct."
