Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(g)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. With the submission of this RMP. the responsible official certifies that, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete. \r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION OF CALCULATIONS WILL BE PROVIDED UPON REQUEST"

This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hidalgo and Argo Gas Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County Emergency Management Association (EMA).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate EMA officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic EMA meetings, the plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the EMA and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe PSM Coordinator has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.

The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of company staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the plant would rely on the local fire department to respond.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - HIDLAGO & ARGO GAS PLANT \r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy West Texas Gas Company, L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Hidalgo & Argo Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe Hidalgo and Argo Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates condensate from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, dehydrated to remove any water, and is then sent to a turbo-expander where the temperature is reduced. Ethane and heavier liquids are separated from the methane gas stream. The liquids are then stabilized using a de-methanizer to remove any methane entrained.  The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline and the NGLs are pumped into a product pipeline for sales.\r\n\r\nThe products at the plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\r\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario. The worst-case radius to endpoint was determined utilizi"
