      "SummaryText": "worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Ralphs Grocery Riverside RMP Plan on file at the facility. Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios was estimated using 2010 census tract data from CAMEO - MARPLOT Version 4.2.1 Mapping Software\r\n\r\n-- THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nRalphs Grocery Riverside has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. To meet these necessary requirements Ralphs Grocery Riverside has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nBoth operating divisions located at the Ralphs Riverside complex (Distribution Center and Creamery) independently maintain their RMP and PSM programs, which include PSM/RMP Committees at both the DC and the Creamery that meet regularly to review and address any outstanding issues related to Compliance Audits, PHA studies, Incident Investigations, etc.  The leaders of the PSM/RMP Committees at each division are the Facilities Engineering Manager (Distribution Center) and the Plant Engineer (Creamery).\r\n\r\nThe one element of the RMP programs that is jointly implemented between the DC and the Creamery is the Emergency Planning & Response section.  This includes the on-site emergency response team that conducts joint exercises, training, and pre-planning meetings.\r\n\r\n-- ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nBased on definition into the accident history of the at the Ralphs Grocery Riverside facility within the last five years, there has been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years\r\n\r\n-- EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\nAt our facility we work in cooperation with the City of Riverside Fire Department to respond to all emergencies. Training on the Emergency Response & Action Pla"

      "SummaryText": "-- ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nRalphs Grocery Riverside is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Riverside City Fire Department and the Riverside County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n-- THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our (2) two closed-loop refrigeration systems. The systems purposes are to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Ralphs Grocery Riverside processing operations. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Ralphs Grocery Riverside is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n-- OFFISTE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text. To evaluate both worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's Toxic Endpoint (TE) for ammonia, 200 ppm, was used to quantify the off-site impact for the facility. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the"

In the event emergency health services are required, maintenance engineers will assist the Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services personnel with direction to the emergency location. Emergency protocols associated with ammonia have been coordinated with our local response agencies to ensure a seamless response will be appropriately implemented.\r\n\r\n-- PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nRalphs Grocery Riverside currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration processes at this time. However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Ralphs Grocery Riverside personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
