CEMWTP has a chlorine storage room on the southwest corner of the building. This room houses the chlorine storage equipment, leak detection equipment and the manifold that the chlorine cylinders are mounted to. The amount of chlorine handled is four, one ton containers. The chlorine storage room is usually checked each shift. In addition to the storage room on the first floor, there is chlorine feed room on the second floor. The room on the second floor consists of chlorine feed equipment as well as chlorine leak detection equipment. CEMWTP operators\n Respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.\n \n 7    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the  maximum quantity in the largest vessel  is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\n7     The worst-case release scenario at Cunningham-East Montgomery W.T.P. involves failure of a one ton container. The model used for this scenario is RMP*Comp Ver.1.05 with the results as follows Chemical: Chlorine, CAS#: 7782-50-5\nCategory: Toxic Gas\nScenario: Worst-case\nLiquefied under pressure\nQuantity Released: 1 ton\nRelease Duration: 10 Min.\nRelease Rate: 110 pounds per min.\nMitigation Measures: Released in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air.\nTopography: Rural surroundings (terrain generally flat and unobstructed) \nT"
