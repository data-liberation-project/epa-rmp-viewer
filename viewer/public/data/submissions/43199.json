      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Facility, located at 10555 Houston Ave, Hanford, California utilizes chlorine in its treatment process. Chlorine is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance, requiring it to be listed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions while being transferred in order to prevent human exposure and also reduce the threat to the facility?s workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. The safety of the community and facility staff depends on the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility, and the training of appropriate personnel about safe procedures used to work with chlorine. \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Hanford uses chlorine gas to disinfect wastewater in three different areas of the Wastewater Treatment Facility. These three areas are:\n\n?    Secondary Sedimentation Basins\n?    Before the retention ponds, after the secondary treatment process\n?    The re-circulation structure\n\nChlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP. Offloading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a two-ton hoist. Four of the one-ton containers are placed in the chlorine building, and five containers are stored outside on storage rails. All of the containers in the chlorine building are placed on the load-cell scale. Two containers are on stand-by. The WWTP facility has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the facility. New orders for chlorine are placed on an as needed basis, once the facility?s chlorine supply is reduced to a combination that totals approximately one full container, five one-ton containers are del"

Although, we have nine one-ton containers on site, rarely do we exceed 12,000 pounds of chlorine. \n\nDelivery of the one-ton containers is during normal working hours. The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off loading of the full one-ton containers and loading of the empty one-ton containers. The chlorine building is not exposed to vehicular traffic. The chlorine building is locked after normal working hours. No unauthorized personnel are allowed entry into the building. The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to per Sections 2.6,2.7, 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute?s Chlorine Manual. \n\nThis treatment facility operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.\nThe amount of chlorine used in the treatment process is dependent upon many factors.  \n\nThe average feed rate from January to July of 2004 was 599 pounds per day. The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum. This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the chlorine gas from the one-ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the rotometer at the chlorine unit. The gas is injected into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is distributed to the location where it is needed in the treatment process. The chlorine building has inlet and outlet exhaust fans for fresh air entry, chlorine leak detectors, and alarm systems. The vacuum regulators are vented to the outside. \n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered part of one complete process.\n\n3a. Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe one-ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine container is the largest vessel in the chlorine system located at The Wastewater Treatment Facility. The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten-mi"

This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for chlorine for the one-ton container located at the Wastewater Treatment Facility assumes a release from valve packing, resulting in a total release quantity of 2 pounds per hour for the regulated substance. The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.1 mile. This chlorine will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source. \n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine systems and the training provided to the chlorine operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures \n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management  (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility?s main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program. \n\n5.

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Hanford Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. The Kings County Division of Environmental Health Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Facility has implemented a written chlorine handling procedure, utilizing the commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM). Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine system. These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for the accidental releases of the regulated substances."
