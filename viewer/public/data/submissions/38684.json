This program incorporated all the elements that were required under OSHAs' Process Safety Management rule. Our facility made changes to the equipment by installing the latest model of suction feed chemical injection system. This change in itself brought the worst case scenario from a possible 4,000 lb. release down to a 2,000 lb. release. This type equipment is the safest for its type available. In addition to a computerized Preventive Maintenance Program, we also have monitoring equipment such as Gas Detectorsand alarms at the point source in the plant. This enables plant personnel to respond quickly and effectively in the event of a toxic release.",

The department head has the overall responsibility of developing and implementing this program within the department.\n\nThe process will include all phases of plant operations including conceptualization, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning.\n\nThe Stationary sources are located at three facilities. The Wastewater Treatment Facility has two regulated substances, Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  The Water Treatment Facility has one regulated substance, Chlorine. The third facility is the Verna Wellfield with one regulated substance, Chlorine.\n\nThe toxic release scenarios are modeled around failure of the vessels. Administrative controls included are strict methods for unloading and proper storage. Mitigation measures include onsite equipment for repairs to pressure relief and encapsulation of valves. In addition to the equipment, operations personnel are trained as part of their apprenticeship to assist in the containment of such releases.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is a detailed program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule. The major elements of the program are:\n    Process Safety\n    Process hazard Analysis\n    Operating Procedures\n    Training\n    Management of Change\n    Emergency Plan\nThere is a site-specific plan for each of the three facilities.\n\nThere have been no recordable accidents at these facilities in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is married"

      "SummaryText": " with the Emergency Planning and Response Plan. This is a detailed method of operation in the event of a spill or toxic release.  Among the elements of the plan, the operators have a protocol to notify the Sarasota County Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Additionally, The Lead Operator or Senior Plant Operator shall have the responsibility to assist the Emergency Response Team in securing and taking control in mitigating the release.\n\nPlanned Changes as a result of this Risk Management Plan have been the replacement of the chemical dispensing equipment. The new equipment is designed to be withdrawn at a vacuum as opposed to the pressure feed system. This eliminated the possibility of a release in the manifold system. The new system is designed to automatically shut off the chemical withdrawl in the event of failure of any equipment or piping along the process after it leaves the vessel.                                                        In additon,  a plan is in place to remove the liquid chlorine system from the facility and replace it with a Sodium Hypochlorite which would enable the City of Sarasota to deregister this RMP."
