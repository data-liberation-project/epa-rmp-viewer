              "Description": "This prevention program covers four LPG co-located storage vessels. While not interconnected, these vessels are stored in close enough proximity to one another that a catastrophic event could potentially effect another. Each vessel supplies a filling station manifold located in the same building that is used to fill DOT cylinders ranging in size from 500 lbs. to 20 lbs. Because each product (butane, isobutane, and propane) have similar characteristics, equipment, maintenance, and are used in the same ways, the single prevention program will suffice for mitigating and preventing offsite (and onsite) incidents. \n\n\n\nFor each product, the same preventative measures and equipment are utilized. The same hazards are present for each and atmospheric differences (in the event of a release or catastrophic event) are negligible and are only discernible on a molecular level. Therefore, training, emergency response, and other procedures may be used interchangeably between products, with respect to the final product being transferred into the portable containers (DOT cylinders). \n\n\n\nPrimary prevention measures are for mitigating uncontrolled releases through manual valves, relief valves, and auto-shutoffs. Fire prevention measures include grounding wires and flash arrestors. \n\n\n\nApproximate maximum capacity of each storage vessel:\n\nBulk tank #1: Butane (approx. 70,000 lbs)\n\nBulk tank #2: Propane (approx. 40,000 lbs.)\n\nBulk tank #3: Isobutane (approx. 45,000 lbs.)\n\nBulk tank #4: 70% butane, 30% propane mix (approx. 33,000 lbs. of butane, 12,000 lbs. of propane - 45,000 lbs total product)",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe are OXARC, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as receipt of containers and product, storage, and employee training associated with the chemicals at this facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances for the safety of our employees and the public. \n\n\n\nUnder the \"Accidental Release Prevention Program,\" responsibility for the proper handling and storage of flammable gases stored and used at this facility is given to the production supervisor and overseen by the Safety and Compliance Manager. Additionally, OXARC, Inc. senior management have responsibility to ensure facility managers, supervisors and the Safety and Compliance Manager keep the program up-to-date and that all reports and findings are taken care of in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n2.    The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is typically minimally occupied and is used for filling filling LPG gases and other company activities. There are three substances stored at the facility above the regulatory threshold (butane, propane, and isobutane) as well as a single bulk storage tank of an LPG mix (70% butane, 30% propane). Each is filled at this facility out of the bulk storage tanks and into the cylinders which are then distributed to our wholesalers and retail facilities for sale. The most common size cylinders filled are 100 lbs. cylinders. The largest size cylinder filled are 500 lbs cylinders which are occasionally filled.\n\n\n\n3.
