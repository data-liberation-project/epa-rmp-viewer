      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Cold Storage (LA Cold Storage) senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Los Angeles Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. Los Angeles Cold Storage has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Program Element Binder Section 12 document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Cold Storage facility is located at 400 South Central Avenue in Los Angeles, California.  Highway 101 is approximately one mile to the north and to the east of the facility, the Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) is 1.2 miles to the south, and the Harbor freeway (Highway 110) is 1.8 miles to the west.  The facility is located in downtown Los Angeles, and the area immediately surrounding the facility is residential and commercial (refer to Figure 1).  The system and the facility were constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe LA Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, th"

      "SummaryText": "e facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The maintenance activities and schedules were developed by, and are performed by, an onsite ammonia refrigeration engineer. \n\n\n\nThis regulation imposes numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by LA Cold Storage to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Employee Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner. The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications, facility operating history, and industry standards.  \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Furthermore, the facility has ammonia sensors in key locations throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history over the past five years (April 2008 to April 2013) revealed that there have been two ammonia releases that meet the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  \n\n\n\nJune 14, 2009 Release: \n\n\n\nOn June 14, 2009 at 6:15 AM, the LA Cold Storage Engineer On-Duty found liquid ammonia and refrigeration oil on t"

      "SummaryText": "he Front Dock floor (located near the Engine Room at the 4th St. Warehouse) and smelled ammonia vapor during his daily round of inspection.  The LA City Fire Department arrived on scene at 6:30 AM after receiving a call from a nearby resident reporting a smell of a \"gas\".  A loose packing nut above the oil cooler was discovered.  Approximately 30 pounds of ammonia was released.  The Engineer On-Duty and one of the LA City Firefighter were sent to the USC County Hospital in the morning for ammonia vapor inhalation and skin irritation, respectfully.  Both were provided first aid and were able to return to work on the same day.\n\n\n\nThe facility pumped out the contaminated mixture and safely stored it in a sealed drum to be removed by Evergreen Environmental, cleaned the vault, replaced the oil drain valve, and the broken water line.  The ammonia detector sensor element was also replaced and tested.  \n\n\n\nDecember 29, 2012 Release: \n\n\n\nOn December 29, 2012 at approximately 7:36PM, an ammonia vapor smell was noticed by the facility's Patrol Guard Service (CCEA) employee.  The LA City Fire Department was notified and fire department personnel arrived on scene at approximately 7:39PM.  The Fire Department was able to isolate the source of the odor to the 410 S. Central Warehouse, commonly known as the Astro Warehouse.  The warehouse and administrative offices were closed at the time.\n\n\n\nThe firefighters discovered a 1 ?\" globe valve that was leaking anhydrous ammonia from a small pilot receiver into the float chamber.  Calculations determined that approximately 10.92 lbs of ammonia were lost to the atmosphere.  Corrective actions included removing the tie strap, placing a separate lockout/tagout notice on each valve, installing a nipple, valve, and plug in float chamber drain, and training engineers with a review of the incident and lockout/tagout.  For full details of the Incident Investigation, see the Summary of Ammonia Incident Investigation Report (2012-1).\n\n"
