There are a total of four screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. All four compressors operate on a -25\u00b0F recirculator package. The compressors have side ports to maintain a +20\u00b0F high side trap. \nThere are two separate suction temperatures a -25\u00b0F low temp. recirculator to maintain freezer rooms and a +20\u00b0F high side trap. The high side trap maintains dock temperatures and sub cools liquid to the low side. \nThere is two rooftop mounted evaporative condensers with remote sumps. There is also two, glycol shell and tube units use for under floor heating. A Hansen auto-purger is also used to remove non-condensable materials. A system dump is also incorporated should a need to purge the system arise.  \nPage 1 December 2003 \nProcess Description \nLiquid Side \nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers. The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses). This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 via a 3\u00bf inch pipe and flows to the thermosyphon header and the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1). \nThe thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid to each screw compressor for cooling of the oil. These oil coolers are mounted on the side of each screw compressor unit. The refrigerant in the oil coolers naturally recirculates to and from the Thermosyphon Receiver when there is a heat load. \nThe high-pressure liquid also leaves the thermosyphon receiver via a 3 line and feeds the Hansen auto-purger unit. The High Temperature trap is operated at +20\u00b0F. The liquid supply to V-2 is controlled by a float and solenoid. \nThe Low Temperature Recirculator is operated at -25\u00b0F. A float and solenoid device controls the liquid supply to V-2. The liquid from the Low Temp"

Screw Compressor C-1 through C-4 removes vapors from the Low Temperature Recirculator. \nThe discharge of all the compressors, C-1 through C-4, is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the Condenser units. The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses). \nSome of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are sent to the one floor heaters. These floor heaters condense the vapors and utilize this removed heat for increasing the temperature of the glycol. This warmed glycol is then utilized for keeping the freezer sub-floor temperature above freezing. \nAdditionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium. This defrost gas is sent to the Air Units for removal of ice that has built up on the coils.  \nPage 3 December 2003 Page 4 December 2003 \nDefinitions \nThermosyphon System \nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the compressor units. This liquid utilizes a shell and tube or plate heat exchanger to keep the compressor's oil cooled and thus allowing the units to operate at the Manufacturer's recommended temperature. \nLiquid ammonia is supplied to the inlet of the heat exchanger. When a heat load is applied to the heat exchanger, some of the liquid is vaporized. This vapor-liquid mixture that is less dense than a pure liquid. The denser liquid (supply) displaces the lighter vapor-liquid mixture thus pushing the mixture out of the heat exchanger and ba"

This difference in density creates a natural circulation. \nSingle Stage Compression System \nA single stage compressor system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system. Each compressor discharges directly to the condenser units via a common header. \nRecirculator System \nA recirculator system is a combination of a vessel, pumps, valves and other components used to feed a refrigeration circuit. The pumps supply liquid to the various evaporators. The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor. \nThe application can be either a low temp or high temp application. The liquid feed can be sub-cooled through an intercooler or fed directly from the receiver."
