      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\n\nThe Colver Power Project (CPP) is a 103.5-Megawatt MW (net) waste bituminous coal fired electric production facility.  This facility utilizes a circulating fluidized bed boiler that produces 785,000 pounds of steam per hour at 10000F, at a pressure of 2525 psi.  The electrical energy is supplied to General Public Utilities.\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This substance meets the minimum requirements set forth in the EPA Risk Management Plan under the Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 112(r) and are covered processes under the act.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies:\n\nThe policy at the Colver Power Project is to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own employees, contractor employees, and to reduce the risk to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafe operations of the processes which use anhydrous ammonia depend on the manner in which we manage these substances, combined with the safety devices inherent in each process design, handling procedures, inspection procedures, maintenance procedures and the proper training of employees in all of the procedures.\n                                                                                                                                                                             \nThe Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used in oxides of nitrogen oxides (NOx) control.  This process is referred to a \"Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction\" (SNCR).   NOx are generated in the combustion chamber when waste coal is fired.  Oxides of nitrogen flow with other flue gases in the flue gas stream, out of the combustion chamber through the cyclone, cyclone outlet and backpass, baghouse and out the stack.  The NOx analyzer, located on the stack, activates the anhydrous ammonia injection system via the "

      "SummaryText": "Bailey DCS.    Injector ports located at the cyclone inlet inject anhydrous ammonia into the flue gas stream and reduce the amount of NOx emitted into the atmosphere.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a single above ground tank with a water capacity of 12,000 gallons.  The tank is located outdoors, 30 feet east of the baghouse.  \n\nFacility administrative controls limit the maximum storage capacity to no more than 75%, which is equal to about 51,200 pounds or (9000 gallons) of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\nTwo unmanned monitors (water cannons) are located strategically near the ammonia storage tank.  One is 100 feet southwest, the other 75 feet northeast.\n\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia System Complies with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management.\n\n5-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Colver Power Project (CPP) is a 10- year old facility and as such does not have a history of accidental releases of any regulated EPA substances.\n\nThe dates stipulated below represents the 5-year period that has been selected and coincides with the RMP submittal.  \n\nThe 5-year period runs through June 21, 2004 (EPA?s interpretation of the regulations is that RMPs initially due on June 21, 1999 must be updated by June 21, 2004, not before).\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe emergency response program is based on facilities \"Preparedness and Prevention and Contingency Plan\" which includes procedures for the notification of key facility management personnel and the following agencies:\n\n- Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) - Ebensburg Office (Local Office)\n- Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission\n- Cambria County Emergency Management Agency\n- Cambria County Hazmat Team\n- Local Fire Department\n- Police Department\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Saf"
