This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. EnLink Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated  substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nCrude Oil VEX is gathered and sent to the Port of Victoria Terminal for storage prior to being sold for domestic consumption. The product is sent to Port of Victoria via pipeline or truck. The product is then pumped to a barge loading facility and shipped. \n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains two sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; station Crude Oil VEX stabilized and Crude Oil VEX non-stabilized. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the processes at the Port of Victoria Terminal that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation, this summary addresses each of the RMP elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\n \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and  associated  hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information  is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Port of Victoria Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process  and facility ch"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check-List techniques to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Port of Victoria Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Port of Victoria Terminal maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or  equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Port of Victoria Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work  in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.   This  is  accomplished by providing  contractors with  (1) a  process  overview,   (2)\n\n \n\n\n\ninformation about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, EnLink Midstream has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Port of Victoria Terminal is coordinated with the Victoria County     Local     Emergency     Planning     Committee     (LEPC).     Mr. Robbie Kirk  is the contact for the LEPC (361/573-9181). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Port of Victoria Terminal has around-the-clock  communications  capability. EnLink Midstream operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the EnLink Midstream conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Port of Victoria Terminal provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Port of Victoria Terminal has had no accidents in the last five years; therefore the accident history has no bearing on the program determination.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Port of Victoria Terminal resolves findings from PHAs and audits, some of which result in modifications to the process. The most recent PHA was conducted on February 9, 2015 at the Port of Victoria Terminal. Minor changes to the P&IDs may be made after the date of this RMP. Any changes affecting the quantities of any regulated substances will result in an update of this RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecord Ke"
