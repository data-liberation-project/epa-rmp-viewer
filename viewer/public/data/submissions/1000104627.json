      "SummaryText": "Seatex-Pasadena operates a batch chemical blending and manufacturing facility that includes processes that utilize ammonia and formaldehyde. The ammonia is stored in storage tanks, drums, totes and tank trucks. The formaldehyde is stored in storage tanks. Seatex-Pasadena's  policy is to operate the ammonia and formaldehyde systems in a safe and environmentally sound manner, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment. Additionally, Seatex-Pasadena works with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident at the facility was to occur.\n\nSeatex-Pasadena has two (2) covered processes (Ammonia and Formaldehyde) at the Pasadena Facility that are classified as Program 3 processes and subject to the Program 3 prevention program requirements of the RMP rule. The Program 3 prevention program aligns with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard. Predictive Filing has been selected because the 50% formaldehyde tank truck is intermittently onsite.\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Release Prevention Program that are in place at the Pasadena Facility.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nSeatex-Pasadena maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes. Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process,  technology of the process,  and equipment in the process. Examples of Process Safety Information include but are not limited to safety data sheets and process flow diagrams. Process Safety Information is updated using the Management o"

This information informs employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the processes. \n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nSeaetx-Pasadena has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The purpose of a PHA is to perform a systematic review of existing and/or proposed processes to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.\nSeatex-Pasadena uses one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n-What if\n-What If/Checklist\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n-Fault tree analysis or\n-An appropriate equivalent methodology.\nThe PHA is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as prevention and mitigation measures currently in place and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable. Recommendations are reviewed by the Seatex Pasadena Management Team and after approval, corrective actions are assigned and distributed to impacted personnel for follow-up.  \nAction items are tracked to closure as outlined in the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Procedure to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA.  PHAs are revalidated at least every five"

The revalidation includes a review of the changes and incidents that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for each process area, which address initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations,  normal shutdown and start-up following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. These operating procedures are stored electronically on an internal server for employee access and are periodically reviewed and revised. \n\nTRAINING\nSeatex Pasadena's Training program includes formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, and safety training. Each employee involved in operating a process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures developed for that process. The EHS&S Director or their designee is responsible for scheduling and coordinating the following training for PSM/RMP affected employees.\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  Seatex Pasadena has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment.  Mechanical Training is routinely conducted, and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated. \n \nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Management of Change (MOC) program is intended to cover changes to the process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures, and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process. Seatex-Pasadena reviews and approves a proposed modification at conception under the MOC/PSSR process prior to addressing the change. The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the"

Training requirements for affected personnel will vary depending on the significance of the change. For changes requiring significant updates to procedures or equipment, special training sessions (meeting the training requirements of the company's RMP/PSM programs) may be necessary for operators, mechanics, and/or contractors. For less significant changes, simply communicating information about the change and its anticipated effects on operation/maintenance may substitute for training sessions.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR) must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety process is used in conjunction with the Management of Change (MOC) process.  If the change triggers a PSSR, then approval for startup also requires satisfying the PSSR requirements. The PSSR process requires the appropriate personnel to field verify that the change was constructed and installed per the approved design and equipment specifications following the completion of the installation and prior to startup.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nThe Seatex-Pasadena RMP/PSM program is audited every three years and includes verification that the procedures and practices that have been developed to comply with the RMP Prevention Program and PSM regulations are adequate and being followed.   Compliance audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process, and this person is impartial toward the facility or area being audited. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Seatex-Pasadena Management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked to closure as outlined in the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Procedure.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit repo"

All incidents are reported and investigated according to the Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure. Results of the investigation and lessons learned are then shared with appropriate personnel to prevent future recurrence. Any corrective actions resulting from the incident investigation are tracked to closure using the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Procedure. . Incident Investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nSeatex-Pasadena encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses, incident investigations and compliance audits.  All new employees should be made aware of the RMP/PSM program as a part of the initial orientation process.  At least one hourly employee or a representative of the hourly employee, directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the site operations is represented in all meetings and/or formal discussions concerning RMP/PSM policies and procedures. All files associated with the RMP/PSM program are available as read-only to all Seatex-Pasadena employees.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nThe Seatex-Pasadena facility has safe work practices in place to identify, assess and eliminate or mitigate risks associated with high risk work to ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include but are not limited to: \n \tConfined Space Entry  -  the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous  work areas, \n \tEnergy Isolation  - a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of hazardous energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n \tLine Opening/Breaks - procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazard"

Seatex-Pasadena goes through a selection process prior to allowing contractors to bid work in the facility.  The facility obtains and evaluates information regarding the contractor's historical safety performance and current safety programs.  After contractor selection, Seatex-Pasadena informs the contractor of the potential fire and explosion hazards related to the facility operations, and routinely follow-ups with the contractor to evaluates the performance of the contractor work to ensure the contractor is meeting RMP/PSM and other safety obligations.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nSeatex-Pasadena has never had a significant release of hazardous substance defined by the RMP Rule for the covered processes. In the event of a release, Seatex-Pasadena has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP describes requirements that must be followed in the event ammonia or formaldehyde is released or if an emergency arises during maintenance or the loading or unloading of these substances. Since ChemQuest Chemicals' employees will not respond to releases of regulated substances, the EAP defines the response organizations on call, emergency notification procedures (internal and external), facility evacuation, site communication and best practices to be used in the event an incident should occur. The EAP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to incorporate any facility cha"
