Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\n The management and the employees of the Madison plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Madison facility. If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel are prepared to work with the Dane County LEPC and the Madison City Fire Department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulatory substance handled;\n\nThe primary activity at the Madison facility  is the manufacture of fertilizer for sale to the agriculture user (farmer).\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, generally by Railroad Tank Cars or occasionally by tanker trucks, stored, and used from the storage tank in the manufacture of mixed-grade fertilizers for plant nutrients.\n\n3. The General Accidental release Prevention Program;\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc.; The standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  \n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History;\n\nThis facility has had one accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia in the last five years that resulted in injuries to three employees on site.  The incident was promptly investigated and it was determined that operator error was the cause of the release. There have been no accidental releases that have caused property damage on site, offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response program;\n\nThis facility has:\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.

Planned changes to improve safety;\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the effectiveness of safety practices and the proper maintenance of the faciliity. There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
