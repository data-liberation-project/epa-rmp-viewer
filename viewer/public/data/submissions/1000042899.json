Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\nFrederickson Power in Tacoma, Washington handles aqua ammonia that is considered hazardous by EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.   Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nFrederickson Power's emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the Washington Department of Ecology, and the National Response Center.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe primary purpose of the generating station is to produce electric power from combustion of natural gas.  Aqua ammonia is used at the facility to reduce the concentration of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced during combustion.  Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid in one storage tank.  The aqua ammonia is pumped to an evaporator and then injected into the combustion system where it reacts with the natural gas combustion products to reduce NOx concentrations.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is aqua ammonia.  The maximum amount of aqua ammonia that can be stored at this station is 9,600 gallons or 71,824 pounds (although the storage tank has a capacity of 12,000 ga"

      "SummaryText": "llons, there are administrative controls in place to ensure that the tank is never filled to more than 80% of capacity).\r\n\r\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nFrederickson Power complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable aqua ammonia storage and handling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the aqua ammonia system are thoroughly trained using Frederickson Power's documented training program.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\r\nNo accidental releases of aqua ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life of this facility.\r\n\r\n5.  Emergency Response Program\r\nFrederickson Power's emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of aqua ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the Pierce County Emergency Management and the local Fire Department."
