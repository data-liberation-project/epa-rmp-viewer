      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \nThe City of Mercedes Water Filtration Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Mercedes emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n  \nThe City of Mercedes Water Filtration Plant is located at 208 Illinois, in Mercedes, Hidalgo County, Texas.  The chlorination building at the Water Filtration Plant consists of a three walled canopy structure facing south that is located on the west of the facility.  Four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored in the facility.  Only two 1-ton containers are connected to the system at one time.  These are located inside the walled canopy structure.  One 1-ton cylinder is operational and the other one is used as backup.  The chlorine containers have manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency and a chlorine alarm will be triggered if a release occurs.  Emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is manned 18-hours a day, and operators check the chlorination building daily.  Self- Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 100 ft. and 200 ft. away from the chlorination building, respectively. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Water Filtration Plant includes consideration of two different release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (chlorine): 1) A \"Worst Case Release\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA guidance which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

The toxic endpoints are defined by the EPA as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine. These values correspond to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations which are defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as:\n\n\" The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protection action.\"  \n\nThe estimated population potentially affected by the release is defined as the residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario at the Mercedes Water Filtration Plant was defined by the following conditions:\n\n Failure of 2 one-ton containers resulting in the total release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine;\n\n Release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes;\n\n Use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint;\n\n Consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance; and\n\n EPA mandated meteorological conditions, specifically an F atmospheric stability class, wind\nspeed of 1.5 m/sec, and air temperature of 77:F.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the Worst Case Release scenario resulted in a chlorine toxic endpoint distance of 1.3 miles and an estimated residential population potentially affected of 10,513.
