      "SummaryText": "The anhydrous ammonia facility is located approximately 1.5  miles northeast of Steele, North Dakota.  The facility location was decided because of the distance from the city limits and the direction of prevailing winds.  We handle bulk anhydrous ammonia in a 30,000 gallon tank that is transferred into smaller nurse tanks that are used by local farmers for fertilizer on their fields.  Our policy is that no farmers are allowed to fill or be near the tanks when they are being filled.  We have one man in charge of filling tanks and he has had all of the proper training to handle product and knows what to do in an emergency.  The facility has all of the most recent upgrades as far as safety equipment and also has had the local emergency personnel visit the site annually to refresh everyone in case of an emergency.  In the case of a worst case scenerio, all connections are sized down to where an average fire hose could dilute all discharge to where there would be minimaldanger to anyone within the local proximity.  The closest residence to this facility is my own home and we are prepared for an emergency as best as possible. We have been in operation for nine years and have not had a single accident, injury or mishap as of this date.   We have an emergency plan set up with the local officials in case the need arises.  We have two signs at the plant which have the phone numbers of all the contact people.  One sign is located near the bulk tank and the other is located some distance away at the enterance to the facility.  We plant to add any new technology for safety features as they become available.  Safety is our most important objective and we plan to keep it that way."
