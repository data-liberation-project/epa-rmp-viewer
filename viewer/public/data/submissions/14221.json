We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n-   A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n-   A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n-   An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n-   A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n-   An overview of our emergency response program\n-   An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.      \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces a number of products that include propylene oxide (PO), tertiary butyl alcohol, propylene glycols, propylene glycol ethers, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide.  These units/processes use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nTOXICS\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO):   Approximately 35.4 million lbs are produced, stored and used on-site.  PO is the major product of the facility and is also a feed stock for the  propylene gylcols and propylene gylcol ethers.\n\n\nFLAMMABLES\n\nPropylene:   Approximately 1,800,000 lbs are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is a primary feed stock for the three PO Units"

Propane is a chemical used in the production of PO.\n\nIsobutane:      Approximately 8,200,000 lbs are stored and used on-site.  Isobutane is a primary feed stock for the three PO Units                     \n\nIsobutylene:  Approximately 4,000,000 lbs are stored and used on-site.  Isobutylene is used in the production of PO.                         \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nREGULATED TOXIC CHEMICALS\n\nWorst-case Scenario - Propylene Oxide\n\nThe worst case scenario for propylene oxide (PO) assumes the complete rupture of the largest PO storage tank releasing 13,40,000 pounds of liquid PO into a containment dike, leading to a vapor cloud release.  This release would impact off-site public receptors.\n\nCredit was taken for the containment dike (passive mitigation), the entire contents of the tank were contained, reducing the amount of PO released to the atmosphere.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene Oxide\n\nThe alternative release scenario for propylene oxide assumes failure of a 6\" loading hose or loading arm.  This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail including the emergency shutdown.  The total release would be 20,700 pounds of PO, the vapor cloud would extend past the fence line and impact adjacent industrial sites.\n\nCredit was not taken for safety systems in place that would minimize the "

The overpressure would extend past the fence line and impact industrial and residential neighbors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables assumes a flange separation on an 8\" propylene recycle line.  This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail.  The total release would be approximately 163,000 pounds of propylene, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The overpressure would extend slightly past the fence line and could impact the nearest industrial facility at the fence line.  \n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGERNERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or change to existing processes at the design stage to identify and mitigate potential safety, health, and environmental "
