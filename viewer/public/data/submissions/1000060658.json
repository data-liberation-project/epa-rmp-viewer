The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Burris Logistics maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\n- Training\r\nBurris Logistics has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\nBurris Logistics carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\nBurris Logistics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\nBurris Logistics promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n- Employee Participation\r\nBurris Logistics truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Under no circumstances will our refrigeration personnel remain in a hazardous atmosphere beyond the acceptable limits of their safety equipment. For emergency situations, we are also coordinated with the District 6 Florida LEPC, which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Burris Logistics facility in Orlando, Florida provides logistics services for customers throughout the East Coast of the USA, including the storage and distribution of nonhazardous packaged materials..   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\r\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA RMP*COMP as well as the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.

Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nBurris Logistics has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of an emergency action plan, including evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. Our emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the District 6 Florida LEPC. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
