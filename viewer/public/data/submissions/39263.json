Under District policy, this is  allowed only with the properly trained personnel, proper self contained air packs and back-up operators to assist if a leak occurs.  After the change is complete, all connections are checked for leaks with ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Policy:\n\nIn case of a chemical release, the operator is notified by a chlorine gas detector and auto dial telephone system.  It is the Districts policy to notify the Highlands Fire Department which is the first responder.  The Fire Department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's One Call System.\n\nStationary Source:\n\nThe stationary source of a posible chemical release is the Wasrewater Treatment Plant at 611 Avenue E, Highlands Texas 77562.  The chemical stored and used above the EPA Threshold at this location is chlorine gas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nIt is the policy of Harris County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1 to maintain all chemical feeding equipment and storage facilities in order to prevent accidential chemical releases.  Daily inspections by District personnel allows early detection of possible equipment failure.  Annual preventive maintenance of chemical feeders by outside chlorinator maintenance professionals ensure proper operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has not experienced a offsite accident in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn case of a chlorine release, the procedure is to notify the fire department by phone as to wind direction, type of leak and size of leak.  The fire department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's One Call System.\n\nSafety:\n\nThe District remains committed to maintaining it"
