This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Murphy refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother in"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* \tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* \tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* \tScrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n* \tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n* \tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n* \tVessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., a dump tank)\n* \tCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n* \tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n* \tAtmospheric relief devices\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* \tFire suppression and extinguishing systems\n* \tDeluge system for specific equipment\n* \tTrained emergency response personnel\n* \tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n* \tBlast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  \n\nThe Murphy refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years, although one RMP event did occur. In May, 1994, a fire in the Crude Unit resulted in a fire and in shutdown of that unit for about a week as repairs were made. There were no injuries and no offsite consequences of this event, other than particulates generated by the fire.  The event resulted from the failure of a faulty shaft on a pump.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to monitor and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Murphy refinery, located in Meraux, Louisiana, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc., as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Murphy refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Murphy refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and add"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n \nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Murphy refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo verify that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Murphy refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nThe Meraux Refinery received extensive wind and flood damage from the Katrina hurricane in August, 2005, which resulted in the refinery being deinventoried and shut down for a period of nine months as repairs were made.  During this shutdown period, a number of PHAs became due for their 5-year revalidations.  Upon startup in June, 2006, the refinery launched an aggressive program to catch up on these revalidations, and while some were completed beyond their due dates, all have been completed.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Murphy refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Murphy refinery provide guidance on how to prevent or respond to exceedances beyond upper or lower limits specified for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Murphy refinery has implemented a thorough training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to verify that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n \nContractors\n\nThe Murphy refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Murphy refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Murphy refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

This verifies that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Murphy refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to manage worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) monitoring the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure that requires isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to monitor activities that might produce ignition sources (i.e., hot work) in areas where flammable materials could be present, and (5) a permit and procedure that require that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system that promotes the safe performance of operations and maintenance activities.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Murphy refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), and procedures, as well as other facility changes that could affect covered processes.  This system requires that changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to verify that (1) adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA Revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo verify that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Murphy refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
