              "Description": "We take a systematic approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n7 Process safety information\n7 Process hazard analysis\n7 Operating procedures and safe work practices\n7 Training and performance\n7 Mechanical integrity\n7 Quality assurance\n7 Management of change-technology\n7 Pre-startup reviews\n7 Compliance audits\n7 Incident investigation and reporting\n7 Employee participation\n7 Hot work\n7 Contractors (safety and performance)\n7 Management of change-personnel\n7 Emergency planning and response\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to full compliance with these management systems, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nOur Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that  our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of PSM/RMP Coordinator to a member of the plant organization with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements and the elements of OSHA's PSM program.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's Process Safety and Risk Management Committee, a subcommittee of the site's Central Safety and Health Committee.  This Committee is comprised of members with responsibilities that include developing and upgrading specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs.  Managing the specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs is a line organization function overseen by the Central Safety and Health Committee.  The members of the Process Safety and Risk Management Committee are assigned by the Plant Manager based on recommendations from the PSM/RMP Coordinator.  Currently, structure of the Process Safety and Risk Management Committee is as follows:\n\nProcess Safety and Risk Management Committee (PSRM),\nA subcommittee of Central Safety and Health (CS&H)\n\nPSM/RMP Coordinator\n7 Process Safety Information Leader\n7 Operating Procedures and Safety Work Practices Leader\n7 Management of Change Leader\n7 Process Hazards Analysis Coordinator\n7 Quality Assurance Leader\n7 Pre-start-up Safety Reviews Leader\n7 Mechanical Integrity Leader\n7 Training and Performance Leader\n7 Contractor Safety and Performance Leader\n7 Incident Investigation and Reporting Leader\n7 Management of Change - Personnel Leader\n7 Emergency Planning and Response Leader\n7 Auditing Leader\n\nThe general organizational structure and the lines of authority at the DeLisle Plant for RMP implementation and compliance are as follows:                                                                                                                     \nPLANT MANAGER\n   Operations Manager\n        Unit Manager - Reaction, Purification, Oxidation, Environmental (RPOE)\n        Unit Manager - Finishing, Packaging, Distribution (FPD)\n        Engineering Manager\n    Unit Manager - Services\n        Sr. Consultant - Safety, Health, Environmental, & PSM/RMP Coordinator\n        Area Manager, Training\n        Occupational Health Specialist\n        Safety Specialist\n     Research and Development Supervisors\n\nOPERATIONS MANAGER\n    Unit Manager, RPOE\n        Area Manager - Reaction\n        Area Manager - Purification and Oxidation\n        Area Manager - Maintenance\n    Unit Manager - FPD\n        Area Manager - Finishing\n        Area Manager - Maintenance\n    Engineering Manager\n        Area Manager - Power and Power Maintenance\n        Project Manager\n        Senior Plant Buyer\n        Area Manager - Operations Support & Contract Administration\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets     EPA RMP  and OSHA PSM requirements. Although the PSM/RMP Coordinator has some specific individual responsibilities, many of the responsibilities for specific program elements are assigned to other members of the Process Safety and Risk Management Committee and the site's line management organization.",

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe DuPont White Pigment and Mineral Products (WPMP) Plant at DeLisle, Mississippi has a mission that includes \"safely make and ship the best TiO2 in the worldin a way that creates a great place to work and continually enhances our license to operate.\"  To accomplish these aspects of our mission, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  DeLisle's approach to accidental release prevention is to fully comply with OSHA's PSM rule and DuPont's standard on Process Safety Management, S21A-PSM.  While complying with the OSHA rule and our own standard, we address all elements of the RMP rule for a Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe DuPont Plant at DeLisle, Mississippi is located on the north shore of the Bay of St. Louis about 15 miles west of Gulfport, Mississippi. The facilities are situated on a 2400-acre site; however, only about 200 acres are developed.  We manufacture a single product, titanium dioxide (TiO2), under the trade name TiPure (TM).  Titanium dioxide is manufactured via the chloride process in which titanium dioxide ore is chlorinated to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4); the TiCl4 is subsequently re-oxidized to refined TiO2.  The RMP covered chemicals we handle are detailed in the following:\n\n              TOXIC                                             USE AT DELISLE\n              Chlorine                                          Produce Titanium Tetrachloride\n              Titanium Tetrachloride                    Intermediate used in the manufacture of TiO2\n\nThe worst-case release scenario  would be the failure of the largest chlorine storage tank  with the contents being released over a 10-minute interval.  With the weather conditions stipulated by EPA, and no administrative controls o"

      "SummaryText": "r mitigation measures considered, public and environmental receptors could potentially be impacted. Determinations were made using EPA's RMP*Comp (TM), version 1.06,  Land View III (TM)  Environmental Mapping Software and United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps.\n\nAlternative release scenarios involve the simultaneous vapor release of 300 pounds of chlorine and 4000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride from an oxidation reactor over a 10-minute time interval.  With typical weather conditions, and no administrative controls or mitigation measures considered, only public receptors could potentially be impacted.  Determinations were made using SAFER (TM) Trace 8.0 (b) atmospheric dispersion modeling software, LandView III(TM) Environmental Mapping Software, USGS maps and weather conditions provided by the Southern Regional Climate Center. \n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nOn January 9, 1998, DeLisle experienced two (2) OSHA recordable injuries as the result of the accidental release of approximately one (1) pound of chlorine during chlorine railcar hook-up.  Both were inhalation injuries.  There was no off-site impact as a result of this release.\n\nOn February 10, 1997, DeLisle experienced one (1) recordable injury as the result of the accidental release of 12 pounds of chlorine.  The release occurred when a pipeline failed during start-up.  This injury was to the ankle and was received while exiting the building.  There was no off-site impact as a result of this release.\n\nOn August 30, 1996, DeLisle experienced three (3) OSHA recordable injuries as the result of the accidental release of approximately 400 gallons (5000 pounds) of liquid titanium tetrachloride.  The release occurred during the performance of maintenance activities.  All three were inhalation injuries.  "

      "SummaryText": "There were no off-site injuries; however, there was local media attention.\n\n\n\nDeLisle's emergency response program is contained in our Emergency Procedures Manual (EPM).  It consolidates the various regulations for emergency response planning. It provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We do coordinate our plan with applicable community emergency response plans and local responders.  Important keys to the success of our emergency response program include:\n\n- a trained on-site emergency organization,\n- training for all employees, including routine drills,\n- drills and information sharing with local emergency responders and,\n- the use of our Early Warning System (EWS) to alert our near neighbors.\n\nTo improve DeLisle's safety  performance and position, we make improvements to plant facilities and systems through various processes.  Some of these are PSM processes such as process hazards reviews, incident investigations and auditing.  We also make improvements as identified by our WPMP PSM Network. This network has membership from each of our TiO2 production sites."
