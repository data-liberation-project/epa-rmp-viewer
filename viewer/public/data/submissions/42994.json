The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated annually  to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc.'s Chester facility was completed in May 2002. The facility serves as a refrigerated warehouse and storage facility. The facility is located at 1 Elizabeth Lane in Chester, New York about 0.75 miles west of Highway 6 and 0.5 miles south of Highway 94. The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some light commercial areas.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and to IIAR guidelines.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 19,900 pounds of"

The condenser is mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 19,700 pounds in 10 minutes.  (The capacity of the +15  Recirculator is approximately 19,700 pounds of ammonia.)  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference tables in the EPA-approved Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches 2.2 miles off site and may impact population and environmental receptors.\n\n*Alternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 130 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches 0.2 miles off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. facility operates in accordance with OSH"

      "SummaryText": "A's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. facility including each ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels and compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to the atmosphere. \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is new as of May 2002; therefore, there is no ammonia-related accidents at the facility to report.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Chester Fire Department and the local fire houses.

The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to renovation of the facility.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. Chester facility located at 1 Elizabeth Lane in Chester, New York.  Many of the recommendations are complete and implemented as of the system startup date.  All recommendations are scheduled to be complete by May 2003.\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS\n\nExternal events were considered during the HAZOP as any type of catastrophic failure (i.e. line break).  Catastrophic failures encompass the following external events: meteorite impact, missile impact, sabotage, and war.  A catastrophic line failure of the ammonia system could result in a line break which was examined in the Hazard Assessment.  In addition, a separate external events and seismic assessment studies were conducted.\n\n\nDATA ELEMENTS NOTES\n\nDue to rounding requirements of the data submitted to the EPA, some data elements in the RMP*Submit do not match the results presented in the PSM/RMP document.  For example, the EPA requires that data element 2.6, the worst case release rate, be rounded to one significant digit.  The results are presented at 2,000 lbs/min, instead of 1,300 lbs/min. as was presented in the Hazard Assessment.    In addition, item 2.6 is the mitigated release rate to outside air, while item 2.5 is the total quantity released; therefore items 2.7 times item 2.6 do not equal item 2.5.  There is a similar rounding error items in 3.5 and 3.6."
