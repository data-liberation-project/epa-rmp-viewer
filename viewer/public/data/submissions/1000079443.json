This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure that a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Trinidad Plant facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Plant, located in rural Henderson County, is one of many facilities operated by Midcoast. The facility is a natural gas compressor station that also receives, stores and introduces natural gas liquids (NGLs) into the pipeline for sale to wholesale markets. Natural gas entering the plant is filtered and passes through molecular sieve beds where it is dehydrated. The dehydrated gas is then compressed to a higher pressure by one of the three inlet compressors prior to entering the ethane recovery plant. The ethane recovery plant separates ethane from the heavier hydrocarbons at a very low temperature and high pressure. Following separation, the residue gas is compressed and enters the pipeline for sale. The liquid component from the ethane recovery plant enters an amine unit, where the unit reduces the"

In addition, all\r\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\r\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\r\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\r\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\r\nmaintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process\r\nequipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work\r\nin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in\r\ntheir workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand\r\nand follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find\r\nduring their"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,\r\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\r\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Trinidad Gas Plant\r\nevaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas\r\nplant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are\r\nfulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that\r\nrequires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that\r\nsafety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior\r\nto placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure\r\nconstruction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are\r\noperationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR\r\ninvolves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by\r\nrequiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure\r\nvessels, piping systems, relief valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency\r\nshutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1)\r\nconducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests,\r\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In\r\ncombination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health\r\nhazards,"

      "SummaryText": "(3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable\r\nsafe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled\r\npreventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. \r\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to\r\nverify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure\r\nvessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the\r\nequipment back into service (if possible), or plant management will review the use of the\r\nequipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Trinidad gas\r\nplant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps\r\nensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare\r\nparts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and\r\nprocess safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\r\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\r\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\r\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing\r\nactivities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are\r\nin place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of\r\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\r\nperformed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Trinidad Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to"
