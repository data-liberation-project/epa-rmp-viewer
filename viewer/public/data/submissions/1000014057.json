EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155                                                                        \nThe City of Frederick Utilities Department operates the Linganore Water Treatment Plant at 6436 Plant Rd, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  This plant is one of four water plants operated by the City.  The City also operates one wastewater treatment plant.  The Linganore water plant as well as the Monocacy water plant and the wastewater plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Linganore Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Frederick has a management system in place which is lead by the City's Mayor, who delegates implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements to the Public Works Department Director.  The Director delegates the RMP program to the Utilities Acting Deputy Director who has responsibility for water treatment plant operations and RMP Program implementation.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.    PRE"

The program addresses each of the EPA Prevention Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, and other RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants OSHA PSM program which the City has been in compliance with.  These program documents are maintained City of FrederickA?s water plant Superintendent and the CityA?s Risk Coordinator.\n2.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant employs six (6) full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n2.1.    SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)    \nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Frederick and managed by its Public Works Department.  The site is located at 6436 Plant Rd, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  The site is located in a forested area, boarded by Linganore River on the west.\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage and feed room and adjacent chlorine control room which also houses the injection feed distribution system.  The chlorinated water feeds various injector points in the plant.  Chlorinated water beyond the chlorine control room is outside in the boundaries of this process. \nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage Feed Control and Chlorination Control Room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems and chlorine injection units in the chlorine control room as well as utility support system.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n2.2.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (B) (2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance "

The City of Frederick chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Maryland Department of Environmental Protection (MD DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to several process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is non-flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling 15 minute permissible exposure limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum quantity stored on site is eight (8) each one ton containers.  This equals 16,000 pounds.  The maximum threshold quantity stored on site is eight (8) each one ton containers.  This equals 16,000 pounds.  The immediate dangerous health (IDLH) level is 10 ppm and a lethal concentration (LC-5O) of 250 ppm.\n.\n3.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public and environment surrounding the plant.  For chlorine, the distance to the endpoint concentration which the gas would travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios: a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\".  The City maintains a five-year accident requirement for the WTP chlorine system (see Section 5 below: Five Year Accident History).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which st"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\nThe City of Frederick accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been effectively used for many years.  It and the RMP programs are part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall Water and Sewer Division wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  Both are coordinated with the Frederick County Fire/Rescue Department (including the Haz Mat Team) and the Regional LEPC.\n4.1.

See the Emergency Response Program manual. \nThere is specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine. \nFinally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key in the operations manual of the chlorine system.\n4.2.3.    Facility Design\nThe chlorine storage is located in a room of the chemical building.  The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage area and control building room are equipped with forced ventilation system.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the storage building rooms.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms.  The chlorine control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarms and a flashing red light illuminates in their local area as well as in the water plant control room.  The alarm system is tied into the security system which alerts management.  Finally, the chlorine alarm starts the chlorine room ventilation system. \n4.2.4.    Equipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is very short as it only includes the valve on the ton containers and yoke assembly and vacuum pressure regulator.  These parts are made of anhydrous (elemental) chlorine compatible materials; steel, copper or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorin"

There is one each ton containers on line, and one each full one on standby.  There is an automatic switchover within the vacuum pressure regulator.  One container is in service and the other is on standby. \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  A pressure relief valve vents if the pressure in the line reaches above 12 inches of water pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  A chlorine monitor detects the presence of chlorine in both the ton storage area and in the chlorine control room. \n5.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\nThe plant has been chlorine reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 18 years.    \n6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in both the Plant Emergency Response Policy and City Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated with the Frederick County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response \"decision tree\" and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions for small and large (reportable) release defined in the plant's operating procedures and Emergency Response Plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the water plant Safety Committee, the City Fire and Police Departments.  The Water Plant and Fire Department coordinates with Local Frederick County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Frederick County HazMat Team.  All are located in Frederick Count"

      "SummaryText": "y, Maryland.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant.\nThe Emergency Response or Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators and maintenance staff.  The primary response team includes the Frederick County Fire and Rescue, and Frederick County Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include response to: catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \"B\" Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the City Police and County Sheriff's Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n7.    PERSONNEL (F) (1)\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of FrederickA?s prevention program.  City employees make up the operators and emergency first response teams.  The City of Frederick fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine system operations including participation in:\nA?    PSM/RMP safety teams, \nA?    Development of the operation procedures, \nA?    Hazard evaluations \nA?    Process Hazards Analysis and  \nA?    On-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\n8.    CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (G)\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the internal safety HazOp, tour, and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program. These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  Another major change was made to improve safety in 2005.  The high pressure chlorine pipe system was replaced with a container mounted vacuum regulator.  An Audit was conducted to revie"
