The toxic endpoint is the emergency response planning guideline value (ERPG-2) intended to provide an estimate of the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their abilities to take protective action.  The worst case scenarios presented in this document were chosen based on a knowledge of the regulated processes and chemicals, and through comparison of potential hazards associated with the regulated chemicals. A worst case scenario must also be performed for the flammable substance having the greatest potential for offsite impacts. \n\nToxic Worst Case Scenario: Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride in the TMOA and Clomazone Processes\nThe worst case release scenario selected was the complete loss of the contents of one full anhydrous hydrogen chloride railcar.  The release scenario assumed loss of 140,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride through a toxic gas release in 10 minutes. The distance to toxic endpoint (0.0300 mg/l) reached by anhydrous hydrogen chloride concentrations generated by a 10 minute release of 140,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrochloric acid is 16.0 miles. The residential population estimated for the area as obtained from census data is 1,700,000. Public receptors identified include institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons), parks and recreational areas, and major commercial, office and industrial buildings. \n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario: Isobutylene in the MAC Process\nThe worst case release scenario selected for the RMP-regulated flammable substances was the complete loss of "

      "SummaryText": "the contents of one isobutylene storage vessel with vapor cloud explosion.  The release scenario assumed loss of 285,000 pounds of isobutylene. The distance to endpoint (1 psi overpressure) reached by isobutylene generated by a release and vapor cloud explosion of 285,000 pounds of isobutylene is 0.5 miles. The residential population estimated for the area as obtained from census data is 10.  Public receptors identified include major commercial, office and industrial buildings.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nRMP regulations require that at least one alternative release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present. Scenarios that are more realistic than the worst case scenario were selected as the alternative release. One alternative case scenario is presented and is representative of the regulated flammables at the site. \n\nAlternative Scenario Toxics: Chlorine in the Sulfentrazone and MAC Processes\nThe alternative release scenario simulates a chlorine rail car transfer line rupture. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) was found to be 0.4 miles. The residential population estimated for the area as obtained from census data is 10.  Public receptors identified include major commercial, office and industrial buildings. \n\nAlternative Scenario Toxics: Nitric Acid in the Sulfentrazone Process\nThe alternative release scenario simulates a nitric acid tanker truck transfer line rupture. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.0260 mg/L) was found to be 0.2 miles. The residential population estimated for the area as obtained from census data is 10.  Public receptors identified include major commercial, office and industrial buildings. \n\nAlternative Scenario Toxics: Oleum in the Sulfentrazone Process\nThe alternative release scenario simulates an oleum tanker truck transfer line rupture. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.0100 mg/L) was found to be 0.2 miles. The residential population estimated for the"

Public receptors identified include major commercial, office and industrial buildings. \n\nAlternative Scenario Toxics: Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride in the TMOA and Clomazone Processes\nThe alternative release scenario simulates an anhydrous hydrogen chloride rail car transfer line rupture. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.0300 mg/L) was found to be 0.3 miles. The residential population estimated for the area as obtained from census data is 10.
