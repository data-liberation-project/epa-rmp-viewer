      "SummaryText": "Consumers Oil Company feels it is managing the risk of an ahydrous ammonis release through plant inspections and adherance to Missouri Department of Agriculture rules and regulations.  It also has training sessions for all employees engaged in the transfer of product and the repair of this facility.\n\nWe feel that through careful inspection and maintenace with trained employees we can prevent nearly all accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at this plant.  This plant is engaged in the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonis to be used as a nitrogen fertilizer.  \n\nThe worst case release not disclosed.\nOne alternative release, not disclosed.\n\nAnother alternative release would be the rupture of a hose at the loading riser.  This would result in the release of approximately 266 pounds of anhydrous ammonia having an endpoint of approximately 0.8 miles and possible affecting 154 people depending on wind speed and direction.\n\nBoth alternative releases should be stopped by automatic excess flow valves installed in the piping system.\n\nConsumers Oil Company is regulated by the Missouri Department of Agriculture and also conducts its own inspections of plant, tanks, piping, and hoses used in the transferand storage of anhydrous ammonia.  All employees involved in the storage, transfer, and repair of the facilities are also trained in the proper and safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis plant has no five year accident history to report.  We believe this confirms the success of our maintenance and training procedures.\n\nConsumers Oil Company policy to an emergency is if the situation can be quickly and safely handled by the personnel at hand to do so.  If available personnel cannot either quickly or safely handle the situation they should immediately leave the area and contact local emergency responders (911).\n\nConsumers Oil Company plans to continue good maintenance of the facility and on going training of all employees."
