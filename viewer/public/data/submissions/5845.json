      "SummaryText": "The objective of the Risk Management Program (RMP) is to: 1) provide information that will define action(s) that will effectively prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment; and 2) mitigate the severity of any accidental releases that might occur.  In order to achieve these objectives, this RMP presents information on facility registration, off-site consequence analysis, five-year accident history, prevention program for \"Level 3\" processes, and the emergency response program for the facility.\n\nSpecifically, this program was written for the City of Tarpon Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  This facility is permitted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to operate as a 4.0 MGD Annual Average Daily Flow Type I Bardenpho BNR domestic wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe WWTP uses chlorine gas for disinfection at the facility and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) for dechlorination prior to discharge to the Anclote River.  The chlorine storage and dosing process is located within the perimeter of the facility, while the sulfur dioxide storage and dechlorination system is located at the outfall to the Anclote River.\n\nThe chlorination system uses two 500 pound per day chlorinators to combine chlorine in its gaseous form with water to create an aqueous chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is injected into the filter effluent flow as the water leaves the filter structure.  The chlorine solution dose is determined using an ultrasonic meter that measures the flow of the filter effluent.\n\nThe effluent is then pumped to the chlorine contact chamber.  The chlorine contact chamber serves to provide the detention time needed for effective disinfection.  Effluent flow from the contact chamber flows to the adjacent 2.0 million-gallon reuse water ground storage tank.  After the ground stora"

      "SummaryText": "ge tank fills to its maximum capacity, the effluent level in the chlorine contact chamber increases until it overflows to the pipe transporting it to the outfall.\n\nPrior to discharge to the Anclote River, the effluent is dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide. The sulfonators operation is similar to the chlorinators.  An aqueous sulfur dioxide solution is dispensed just upstream of the outfall weir.\n\nBoth the chlorination and dechlorination processes are subject to 40 CFR Part 68 Level 3 requirements.\n\nIn order to have a sufficient amount for treatment, five 2,000 lbs chlorine cylinders are kept at the WWTP at a time.  The cylinder containers are stored in an elevated 17 by 31-foot concrete building, approximately 70 feet to the west of the operations building. The cylinders are maneuvered and placed on trunnions with an electric chain hoist.  The EPA threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 lbs.\n\nFour 2,000 lbs sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) cylinders are kept at the dechlorination building, which is approximately 850 feet north of the WWTP.  The cylinder containers are stored in a concrete building similar to that for the chlorine storage.  The cylinders are maneuvered and placed on trunnions with an electric chain hoist.  The EPA threshold quantity for sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 5,000 lbs.  Both storage buildings have exhaust fans, emergency breathing apparatus, and are protected from vehicle impacts.\n\nA series of Off-Site Consequence Analyses (OCA) were conducted to provide information to the employees, emergency responders, and public about the potential consequences of an accidental chemical release at the WWTP. The OCA for each chemical (i.e., chlorine and sulfur dioxide) consists of two scenarios:  \na.  Worst-case Release Scenarios; and\nb.  Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nThe detailed analysis for each scenario is presented in Section 3 - Off-Site Consequence Analysis.  The following matrix presents the combined results of the OCA for both chlorine and sulfur dio"

On May 29, 1998, an undetermined quantity of sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) was released from a 2-inch PVC feed line at the outfall.  No known off-site impacts were reported as a result of this incident.  As a result of the incident investigation, a number of operational and process changes were made.\n\nPrevention Program for Level 3 Process identifies the elements that are the foundation of sound prevention practices: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, and compliance audits.   It is critical that these prevention practices be implemented in the operation of the WWTP on a daily basis.\n\nEmergency notification, response, and first aid procedures provided in this RMP were written in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 and take into account existing measures established by the City, emergency responders, and WWTP operations experts.  These procedures are not intended to take the place of sound and reasonable judgement."
