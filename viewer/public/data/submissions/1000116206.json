      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Celanese's Clear Lake Plant we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and Emergency Response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n- An overview of our Accidental Release Prevention Programs\n- A summary of the Offsite Consequence Analysis\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our Emergency Response Program\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nOur facility produces mainly commodity organic chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. The major products manufactured at the facility are acetic acid, vinyl acetate, carbon monoxide, and methanol. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n-Vinyl Acetate, produced at a rate of 1250 million lbs/yr, is sold entirely in the merchant market where it is used in paints and adhesives. The material is stored on site in inerted atmospheric tanks. \n-Ammonia is used onsite as the catalyst in Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx emissions. Ammonia is received via tank truck deliveries and is stored onsite in a storage tank with a capacity of approximately 61,000 lbs of ammonia when liquid full.\n\nFlammables\n-Acetald"

      "SummaryText": "ehyde is a byproduct in the production of vinyl acetate. It is recovered and shipped to another company location to be used as a raw material. About 800,000 lbs are stored on site as a liquid in a pressurized sphere.\n- A flammable mixture (40,000 lb) is found to occur at the Vinyl Acetate.   This mixture contains ethylene, methane and ethane above the RMP threshold quantity. The estimate is based on mass balance using a correlation to correct actual densities and account for compressibility factors.  \n-Propylene is used in a closed refrigeration system which cools part of the carbon monoxide production process. Propylene is received from Propylene pipeline supply and stored in three liquid vessels. The system contains a maximum of 18,000 lbs of propylene, if liquid full. The system is currently idled in place. \n-Methane and Synthesis Gas (Flammable Mixture) are a feedstock and intermediate, respectively, of the Methanol production unit. Methane is received from Natural Gas pipeline supply, and Synthesis Gas is created in the Methanol Reformer. Neither Methane nor Synthesis Gas are stored onsite, however both flammable chemicals exceed the RMP threshold quantity based on the capacity of the process unit's vessels, towers, and associated piping that would contain one of these chemicals. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nToxics:\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that the vessel with the largest amount of Vinyl Acetate had a catastrophic failure resulting in a toxic release. The release duration was estimated at 27.3 minutes using  RMP*Comp\u0099 an EPA-sponsored software tool.  RMP*Comp was also used to calculate the distances of 25 miles to reach the 0.26 mg/l (ERPG-2) endpoint.  Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as a"

We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental\nreleases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of\nsuccessful prevention programs including:\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-startup Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Contractors\nCommon Work Practices are in place such as energy isolation, hot work permits, and conduct of\noperations.\nConduct of Operations includes:\n- defining standards for handover of equipment between operations and maintenance,\n- following Standard Operating Procedures,\n- recertifying operators,\n- defining standards for equipment labeling,\n- approving and making notifications before removing safety equipment in service, and\n- verifying equipment readiness by operations prior to placing in service.\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention\nsteps:\n- limit the level to which a tank can be filled In the vinyl acetate process:\n- use of nitrogen blanketing in all storage tanks to avoid flammability.\n- use of mounted water spray around the acetaldehyde sphere to prevent formation of a vapor cloud in case of a release.\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the requirements of the law and our"

During the past five years there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nCelanese Clear Lake Site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. We are a member of CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid), a consortium of area companies that coordinates and help each other during emergencies in which the individual plant's resources may not be sufficient to effectively handle the response.  \n\nCelanese  Emergency Response Plan (ERP) includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, including emergency response personnel, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Pasadena Fire Department. The ERP defines the steps to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances to protect personnel, public safety, and the environment. The Plan includes actions to be taken including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the general public.   In addition, there are emergency response field exercises performed annually where there are simulated accidental release of a regulated substances to ensure personnel and the emergency response team is prepared to respond accordingly.\n\nThe latest update to the ERP was made in 03/23/2020.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAs a result of the PHAs (Process Hazards Analyses) that are conducted periodically"
