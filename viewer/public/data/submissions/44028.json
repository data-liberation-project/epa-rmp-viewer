This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and emergency operating procedures and emergency planning and response.  DairiConcepts also has an emergency action plan in effect, which is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\nAmmonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere.  The refrigeration system is designed such that under normal operating conditions, no ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  However, unforseen circumstances or system upset could lead to leakage of a portion of the ammonia from the system.  Given the strong odor of ammonia, even a small quantity of released ammonia will be detected at some distance from the source of the leak.  Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health concerns.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system expansion project at DairiConcepts was completed in October 2005.  The facility is located in the city of Portales, New Mexico.  The complex includes processing areas with auxiliary office space.  The ammonia refrigeration system is used to chill glycol and water to provide refrigeration for the facility's processing areas.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 13,2"

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including most vessels and compressors, while the condensers are mounted on the roof.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DairiConcepts ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years (October 2000 - October 2005), the facility has not had an accidental release of ammonia causing personnel injury or with off site consequences.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDairiConcepts has a Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations.  This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  \n\nThe Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous material agency notification and procedures.  This Plan then proceeds to detail the procedur"

The PHA consisted of a:\n\n\u00bf Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n\u00bf series of safety checklists; and\n\u00bf facility inspection.\n\nAll recommendations resultant from the revalidation study are due to be completed by October 2006."
