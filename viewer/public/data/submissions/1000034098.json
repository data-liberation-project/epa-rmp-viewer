This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur at Lonestar NGL Mont Belvieu Fractionators (FRAC), our response activities are coordinated with Mont Belvieu Police Department and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Lonestar NGL Mont Belvieu Fractionators (FRAC) RMP-regulated activities consist of extraction and fractionation of Y-Raw Grade Feed.  The plant is to be capable of processing 100,000 BPD of Y-Grade that is delivered by pipeline into Mont Belvieu.  The compostion used for equipment sizing includes a 54% C2 case and a 38% C2 case.\n\n\n\nThe FRAC Facility separates pipeline liquid natural gases to produce the following pure components:\n\n1. Ethane\n\n2. Propane\n\n3. N-Butane\n\n4. Isobutane\n\n5. Natural Gasoline\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps the facility has taken represents all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLonestar maintains a detailed record of safety information tha describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficie"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not more than five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lonestar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nLonestar has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLonestar carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detectors, and temperature and pressure switches.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Lonestar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, and any administrative change that could impact safety and health.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nP"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLonestar will conduct audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly and adequately implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLonestar promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLonestar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.

Five-year Accident History\n\nLonestar as a whole company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental release of substances regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 during this period which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or know off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nLonestar maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the emergency response plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the present time, there are no plans for significant changes to the facility for purpose of improving safety."
