Introduction:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Terminal in Meredosia receives\n\nfertilizers from barges, stores the fertilizer in tanks, and\n\nloads trucks. The facility has one anhydrous ammonia tank\n\nand four urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) liquid fertilizer\n\nstorage tanks.\n\n\n\nB.   Accidental Release Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen, Meredosia Terminal, has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964.\n\n\n\nThe facility safety record is direct result of continued\n\nemphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors,\n\nand truck drivers. There have not been any releases from the\n\nTerminal that meet the description of an RMP accidental\n\nrelease.\n\n\n\nIn case of a reportable chemical accident, information in\n\nthe RMP will be updated within six (6) months of the date\n\naccident accrued.\n\n\n\nC.   General Accidental Release Prevention Policies And\n\n  Activities:\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes safety and concern for the\n\nenvironment must be second nature to all employees and\n\ncontractor personnel.\n\n\n\nThe entire Royster-Clark Nitrogen team works together to\n\nensure the facility complies with OSHA'S Process Safety\n\nManagement standards and the accident prevention program are\n\ncontinuously improved. A networked computer management\n\nsystem is utilized to provide our employees with the\n\nnecessary tools and records to maintain the safety of the\n\nprocess. This teamwork is an integral part in the safety\n\nefforts of the facility.\n\n\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen-\n\nelement program for Process Safety Management, a management\n\nsystem, corporate oversight of the facility, and a focus on\n\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees to\n\nparticipate in the facility's safety program.
