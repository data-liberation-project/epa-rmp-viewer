(Linde) facility located in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico complies with applicable requirements for Methylamine storage , and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our Methylamine storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Ponce Fire Department and the Linde  Emergency Response Team, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde facility stores Methylamine only  in cylinder of 525 lbs. The cylinders are transported to the facility, stored for a period of time, and then shipped from the facility.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenarios:\nThe flammable worst-case release scenario for the Linde facility considers the potential failure of the 525 pounds Cylinder, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure) was determined to be 0.06 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include: residential property;  and, commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities.  The residential population within this 0.06-mile radius is approximately 200 persons, which was estimated using population density data generated from a  USGS map and the US Bureau of the Census.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenarios:\nThe flammable alternative release scenario for the Linde facility considers the potential release of Methylamine from a 525 pound capacity storage cylinder (i.e., caused by a cylinder being knocked over, resulting in the cylinder valve being broken off), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The release rate of Methylamine from the cylinder was estimated to be 1"

      "SummaryText": ".67 pounds per minute.  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 60 minutes.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 525 pounds of Methylamine.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.03 miles.  The affected public receptors under this alternative release scenario are commercial, office,  industrial facilities and/or public road.  There is no residential population within this 0.03-mile radius.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe Linde facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal and local codes and regulations.  \n\n6.  Five-year accident history:\nThe Linde facility has never had an accident involving its methylamine storage process.  \n\n7.  The emergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our covered processes, it is Lide's policy to immediately notify the Ponce Fire Department and Linde Emergency Response Team, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Ponce Fire Department.  All members of the Linde Emergency Response Team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility.  All employees have access to Linde's emergency action plan, and emergency response training is conducted annually."
