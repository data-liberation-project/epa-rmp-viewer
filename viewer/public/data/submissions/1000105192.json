Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.

These procedures along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nBone Springs has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\n\nChanges are reviewed to:\n\n1)\tEnsure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and;\n2)\tVerify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nBone Springs investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction has been completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nBone Springs has established practices and procedures for the safe operation of fixed, rotating, pressure containing and emergency shutdown equipment. The basis aspects of the program include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n1)\tConducting training;\n2)\tDeveloping written procedures;\n3)\tPerforming inspections and tests;\n4)\tCorrecting identified deficiencies, and;\n5)\tApplying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training:\n\n1)\tOverview of the process;\n2)\tSafety and health hazards;\n3)\tApplicable maintenance procedures;\n4)\tEmergency response plan, and;\n5)\tApplicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nBone Springs maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of operations such as:\n1)\tNormal startup,\n2)\tNormal operations,\n3)\tTemporary operations,\n4)\tEmergency shutdown,\n5)\tNormal shutdown,\n6)\tStartup following an emergency shutdown, and \n7)\tInitial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nCovered process operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks and maintain the covered process unit within its safe limits.\n\nTraining [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nBone Springs has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing th"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters an specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nBone Springs has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nBone Springs primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenan"

      "SummaryText": "- The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nThe Bone Springs JV Ranch Gas Plant has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training site personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n- The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nBone Springs JV Ranch Gas Plant uses cryogenic fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas.  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances (propane and a flammable mixture containing methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane) are processed, recovered and stored at the facility.\n\n- The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the processes at the facility.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nEmployees of Bone Springs are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nBone Springs keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help mai"
