      "SummaryText": "The Miller Breweries West Limited Partnership is engaged in the beer production business.  As part of the brewing process, an ammonia refrigeration system is utilized.  Due to the quantity of ammonia maintained on-site, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program regulations, which are meant to promote safety at the facility and general public level.\n\nThe Miller Breweries West Limited Partnership is committed to promoting a safe working environment and has developed and implemented several programs to ensure chemical safety.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration process and has several methods for ensuring employee and public safety associated with this process.  The facility has developed procedures, plans, and policies for the operation of the ammonia process and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases.  The Miller Breweries West Limited Partnership has implemented a process safety management program that enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis, compliance audits, employee and contractor training, employee participation, ammonia monitoring/detection, and other activities.  The Fort Worth facility has developed and routinely drills on an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP contains specific staff duties and responsibilities outlined which promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation that may arise during the course of brewery operations.  In addition, the ICP has been submitted to and approved by the Tarrant County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Fort Worth Fire Department routinely conducts Fire Safety Inspections of the brewery on at least an annual basis and participates in a detailed brewery tour during each inspection.\n\nWorst-case and alternative case release scenarios were modeled to determine the greatest impact a release of ammonia from the facility could reasonably cause.  In this way, the facility is prepared to handle any accidental release of ammonia. "

      "SummaryText": " However, in the previous five years, the Fort Worth facility has not had any accidental releases which resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or any known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage from the ammonia process.\n\nThe Miller Breweries West Limited Partnership facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  As a result of these regulations, the Fort Worth facility has implemented a program to further enhance process safety which involves operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity (maintenance-related issues), pre-start-up review, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work (welding) permits, and contractor safety.\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program consists of three major plans/procedures: an Emergency Action Plan, an Emergency Contingency Plan, and a Standard Operating Procedures for Emergency Responders (SOPER) that is part of the Process Safety Management Program.\n\nThe emergency response plans/procedures at the Miller facility contain information and procedures relative to initial response, informing the public, evacuation, fire response, facility-specific information (site maps/drawings, security, communication system, emergency organization), emergency/spill prevention, post-emergency procedures, training summary, and administrative management of change.  Additional information on initial response is included in the Ammonia Refrigeration System Emergency Isolation Valve Maps.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the brewery maintains both an Emergency Response Team and a Utilities Response Team.  Both teams receive extensive annual training to deal with an accidental release at the facility.  Equipment used by the teams is routinely tested and maintained."
