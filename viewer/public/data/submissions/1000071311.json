Starrett Company (Starrett) operates the heat treat process with a goal to minimize the potential and impact of releases and process safety incidents through adherence to legal requirements, effective management systems, procedures, personnel training and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nStationary source and regulated substance:\n\n\n\nThe L.S. Starrett Company (Starrett) stores up to 66,528 pounds of propane at the 121 Crescent Street site in its 18,000 gallon propane storage tank for heat treating and general building heating.\n\n\n\nPropane is a flammable substance which is specifically listed in the EPA Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) provisions of 40 CFR ?68.130 with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Facilities that store propane in excess of 10,000 pounds for use other than fuel or for retail sale are subject to the CAP provisions.  Since storage of propane at Starrett exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold, and the propane is used for heat treating (not exclusively building heat), Starrett is subject to the CAP provisions.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nStarrett has established a process safety management program to prevent the release of propane from the Starrett facility and provides resources to achieve this specific goal.  The elements of the process safety management program are contained in the various sections of a written Risk Management Plan, maintained by Starrett.  This Risk Management Plan is in addition to other established environmental, health and safety programs, which have been developed and implemented to protect employees, the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nOverall, management is committed to safety by being personally involved and committed to the goals of zero injuries and loss incidents.
