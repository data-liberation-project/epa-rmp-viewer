      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis document represents the updated and revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Calpine King City Cogen, LLC (CKCC) located in King City, California. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\r\n\r\n-Acknowledge the continued operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and  requirements. (EPA RMP Facility ID# 1000-0016-4877)\r\n\r\nCKCC uses anhydrous ammonia and stores greater than 20,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is subject to the OSHA and EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 3 facility.\r\n\r\nThe RMP addresses the Program 3 requirements of CalARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the general duty clause of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 3 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\r\n\r\n-identify hazards\r\n-design and maintain a safe facility\r\n-prevent releases\r\n-minimize the consequences of releases.\r\n\r\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \r\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\r\n\r\nThis RMP applies to the CKCC facility located at:\r\n750 Metz Road\r\nKing City, CA.  93930\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe CKCC facility is a 111-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant.

The investigation results, including the implementation of all recommendations, will be reviewed with facility staff whose job responsibilities are relevant to the findings. Copies of the investigation reports will be maintained on site for a minimum of five years, and will be used during the periodic PHA re-evaluations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees (including contractors) at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations. Operational safety is achieved by a constant exchange of information with employees to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program. The facility will implement procedures regarding employee participation in the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and emergency action program. The written employee participation plan and facility policies will ensure that:\r\nA\u00bf\tEmployees at all staff levels are participants in the development and implementation of PHAs. \r\nA\u00bf\tEmployees at all staff levels are participants in the development of the prevention program elements, the hazard assessment, and the emergency action program.\r\nA\u00bf\tEmployees at all staff levels are given access to PHA data, EAP data, offsite consequence data, plan implementation data, etc.\r\nManagement of Design Change\r\n\r\nOperational, safety, and environmental issues must be addressed whenever a change occurs at a facility, which involves an affected process or substance.

Facility staff, as well as contractor staff, must be aware of such sources and hazards, and must take the proper safety precautions during the timeframe that such work is being undertaken. The facility will develop a Hot Work Permit program, which requires that employees complete the necessary work order and notification forms certifying that the applicable portions of the fire prevention and protection plan requirements are implemented prior to the start of hot work operations.\r\nHot Work Permits will be required for all types of open or enclosed ignition sources such as grinding, burning, welding, and brazing. Work performed on or near affected processes, or in areas not approved for cutting and welding pursuant to the fire prevention plan must also have a Hot Work permit. The Hot Work Permit is voided when the use of the ignition source results in a hazardous situation, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the work task requiring the Hot Work permit has been inactive for more than a pre-determined time period appropriate for the job task.\r\n\r\nThe facility will utilize outside contractors to augment the existing workforce both on a regular basis, as well as during periods of maintenance outages, overhauls and construction.

First responders at the operations level have the duty to protect nearby people, property, and the environment and take defensive action from a safe distance to try to stop the release from spreading and make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. The fire departments will handle spill/release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, CKCC may join forces with the fire departments and State/County OES personnel in a unified command effort until the emergency has been mitigated.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\r\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\r\nA\u00bf\tPeriodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network, flow controllers, and injection grid.\r\nA\u00bf\tMonitoring of tank level and system pressures.\r\nA\u00bf\tMonitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\r\nA\u00bf\tInstallation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\r\nA\u00bf\tProvide all required safety and response equipment.\r\nA\u00bf\tProvide a chemical specific training program.\r\nA\u00bf\tAccess to the CKCC facility site is controlled and fenced.\r\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release.

These modifications may require that the process safety information be revised and updated. The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications, which require the process safety information to be updated. The facility pre-startup safety review procedure will be contained within the plant operations manuals. The review generally addresses the following issues:\r\nA\u00bf\tEquipment designed and installed according to prevailing industry standards and specifications.\r\nA\u00bf\tConstruction per existing building and seismic codes and standards.\r\nA\u00bf\tAdequate safety and emergency procedures are developed and implemented.\r\nA\u00bf\tPHA performed prior to startup.\r\nA\u00bf\tMODC procedures initiated and completed.\r\nA\u00bf\tTraining of affected employees initiated and completed.\r\nWhenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MODC review. Additionally, a pre-startup safety review will be performed in conjunction with the MODC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nAn essential element of the RMP program is the use of periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan.
