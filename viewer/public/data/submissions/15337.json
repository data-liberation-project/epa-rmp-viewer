The District encompasses approximately 14,000 acres and is located in a semi-rural, primarily residential and recreational area.  Water District 17 has approximately 3,500 connections and serves approximately 10,000 people with potable water.  Parts of the District are located within the jurisdictions of the City of Austin and the City of Lakeway.\n\nThe water treatment plant is located on the banks of the Colorado River, and uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.  The entire supply on hand consists of approximately 20, 150-pound cylinders.\n\nThe process system consists of two stainless steel pressure mainfold units, with 4, 150-pound cylinders per unit.  A vacuum activated switchover unit isolates the two systems.  A chlorine leak detector, set to 1 ppm, with a sensor mounted approximately 1-inch above the floor is connected to an audible alarm system.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly with all manifold piping replaced annually regardless of condition.\n\nTravis County Emergency Services District No. 6 is located appoximately 3 minutes away and the Lake Travis Medical Clinic is located approximately 5 minutes from the plant.\n\nFive of the ten field personnel and the general manager have received 24 hours of formal training as required by 29 CFR 1910.120, in conjuction with the local fire department personnel, in emergency response for water/wastewater treatment facilities.
