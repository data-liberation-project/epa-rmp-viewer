The Hansen Water Treatment Plant uses 3 co-located chlorination process areas, as follows: Facility No. 1, which is a 60 million gallon per day lime-softening plant has 1 process area; and Facility No. 2, which is a 120 million gallon per day, lime-softening plant contains two chlorination process areas.  Each process area may have a maximum of of 30,000 lbs of chlorine during peak demand. \r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Section 112r regulated substance stored and used at the Hansen Water Treatment Plant, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.   \r\n\r\nThe Plant is located at 7601 Holliday Drive, Kansas City, Kansas. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Assessment\r\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine systems beginning with the unloading of the container and ending with each chemical in solution.  In the assessment, general questions regarding the storage and use areas, as well as protocols associated with the management of the chlorine systems, were answered.  A copy of that checklist is maintained onsite.  Following the checklist, each valve, line, and piece of equipment in each system was assessed from the cylinder or tank to point of chemical injection.  Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each point in the system.  \r\n\r\nPrevention System\r\nThe Plant has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each element of the chlorine systems routinely.  There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive training before being allowed to work on the systems.\r\n\r\nAs each cylinder is changed, the valves and flexible whip connection of the chlorine system are tested for leaks.  There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for"

Personnel are trained on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  The chlorine system is equipped with chlorine detectors and alarms that indicate leaks.  The chlorine alarms indicate by sending a signal back to SCADA and triggering visual and audible alarms.  Chlorine tank storage rooms are protected by a scrubbing system, and automatic tank shutoff valves.  The chlorine tank storage rooms are monitored by security cameras.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nAny response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere requiring Level A personal protection or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by Haz-Mat Response Inc., an emergency response company located in the Kansas City area.  The Kansas City, Kansas Fire Department has agreed to provide emergency response support to the District in the event of a release as described in this plan.  When the Fire Department arrives, District (or contractor) personnel shall share all the information they have concerning the release.     \r\n\r\nAccident History\r\nThe Plant has had no RMP reportable accidents in the past five years.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nIn order to ensure that the Hansen Water Plant is consistently making safety our highest priority, we have overhauled our RMP/PSM Program. Increased communication and transparency regarding RMP/PSM documents with employees ensure that we maintain a positive and active safety culture. We increased our frequency and completeness of process safety information, operations and maintenance documentation. This allows us a more complete perspective on the effectiveness of our RMP/PSM Program as well as to provide a clear history for investigation in the event that an incident occurs. We continue to review the process safety program with operations,and maintenance employees.  This includes site review and documentation of PSM processes. \r\n\r\nNew p"

Items covered by the training include; recognizing a hazardous situation, recognizing a hazardous chemical, handling a hazardous chemical, proper use of protective gear, to include the SCBA, emergency response measures and emergency telephone numbers.\r\n \r\nIt is essential that all Water Production personnel be prepared to effectively prevent and also respond to emergency situations.  Personnel are trained to recognize and prevent potential emergency situations and are ready and prepared for such situations so that minor incidents will not become major emergencies.  The facility has identified the most likely types of incidents and emergencies.  The most likely occurrence in an operation as this is a spill.  The most likely situation where a spill would occur is leaking containers in storage."
