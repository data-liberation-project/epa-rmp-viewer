Regulated chlorine processes are no longer present at the facility and therefore, are not included in this documentation.\n\nFoster Farms Livingston Complex (referred to hereafter as Foster Farms or Livingston Complex) prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations.  The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et.  Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine and anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility.  Foster Farms recently removed all liquid/gaseous chlorine processes and replaced them with alternative systems, further demonstrating their commitment to reduce chemical risks.  Therefore chlorine systems are no longer in this RMP/PSM.\n\nMany state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility as part of the ori"

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\n\nThe Livingston Complex is located at 843 Davis Street in Livingston, California.  The facility is approximately ? mile east of Highway 99 in the northeast portion of Livingston.  Restaurants, a hotel, a gasoline station, and other small retail facilities are located along Highway 99 in the vicinity of the complex.  Residential properties are also located near the site.  The Merced River is approximately ? mile north and northwest of the facility.  Retention basins and unimproved property lie to the north and northeast of the facility.  Railroad tracks border the facility on the west.  Agricultural lands generally surround the Livingston area.  The facility is surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.\n\nThe Livingston Complex consists of four operating units, which are Plant 1, Plant 2, Deli, and Distribution.  Operations at Plants 1 and 2 include the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products.  Operations at the Deli include the production of deli products.  Corn dogs are produced and packaged at the Corn Dog Plant, which is part of the Deli.  Operations at the Northern California Distribution Center (NCDC) consist of storage and shipping of poultry products.  All of the plants have refrigerated coolers for product storage.

The Deli and NCDC are located in the northwest corner of the site, approximately 200 feet north of Plant 2.  \n\nPlant 1 was originally constructed in 1965 and has undergone significant changes since that time.  Plant 2 was built in 1973 and has also been updated.  NCDC was constructed in 1988/1989.  The Deli was constructed in 1971 and has also undergone significant changes.  A second refrigeration system was installed in 1998 as part of the Corn Dog Plant expansion.  \n\nThere are five independent ammonia refrigeration systems (processes) at the Livingston Complex.  Plant 1 has one ammonia refrigeration system.  Plant 2 has one ammonia refrigeration system.  The Deli has two ammonia refrigeration systems.  NCDC has one ammonia refrigeration system.  All equipment is operated and maintained by a single team of trained refrigeration system technicians who are managed and dispatched by a single maintenance management team.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facility.  The systems provide cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, product, water chilling, and ice making.  Central computer systems monitor and control the refrigeration systems.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  The facility reported one chlorine release within the past five years.  The leak occurred in July 1995 from a valve on a one-ton chlorine container.  One minor injury was reported to a Foster Farms employee.  No off-site release occurred.  The quantity of chlorine gas released was approximately three pounds and the duration of the release was less than 30 minutes.  The chlorine process has sin"

Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Livingston Complex due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for a facility and an alternative release scenario for each covered chemical.  The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"?the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\nThe largest ammonia vessel at Foster Farms, the Deli high-pressure receiver, contains 17,740 pounds of ammonia at 80% capacity, the safe fill level for the vessel.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 17,740 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the high-pressure receiver is required for this scenario to occur.  As required by the RMP regulations, pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm) ammonia vapor were assumed.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is approximately 1.37 miles.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the worst case release scenario.

SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario for ammonia described in the EPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998, for an ammonia release from the Complex.  The release scenario is described as a ?-inch-effective-diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.  The evaluation used a release rate of 79.7 pounds per minute and average weather conditions from updated weather data.
