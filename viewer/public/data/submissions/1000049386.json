The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Belle Plaine Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.                                               anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 768,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank(s) and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of A?A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A?A?, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A?A?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammoniaA?A?. In addition, Minnesota Dept. of Ag Rules. For propane, NFPA-58 rules.\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response P"

Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia or propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
