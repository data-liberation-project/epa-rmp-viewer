We coordinate our response efforts with the Donnelly Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank, and seventeen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Donnelly, Minnesota.  The maximum amount stored is 35,000 gallons        (153,094 pounds)including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios (NOTE: Available only for incident\nplanning use to LEPC, Fire Department and Donnelly Cooperative.)\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
