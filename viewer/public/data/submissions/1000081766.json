Five Year Accident History \n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia resulting in death, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or adverse environmental damage. \n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program \n\n\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan that addresses accidental releases of aqueous ammonia.  The plan is designed to minimize the potential for adverse effects of chemical exposure on human health through a combination of containment, control, evacuation procedures, and the use of personal protective equipment.  It further directs appropriate personnel to provide any required notifications to regulatory agencies and the public.  The facility has established and maintains a strong relationship with the Waco-McLennan County Emergency Planning Committee and the local Fire Department. \n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\nAssociates at the Waco facility are vigilant about identifying opportunities for improving facility operations.  Although no changes to the existing plans and procedures are contemplated at this time, the Company is committed to continual improvement in this area.  Regular, periodic reviews of safety and release prevention and preparedness measures will continue to occur.\n\n"
