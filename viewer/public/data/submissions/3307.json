Main Street, Suite A\n                               Kissimmee, Florida 34744-4283\n\nThe City of Kissimmee provides quality drinking water and treats the public's wastewater for much of Kissimmee and Osceola County.  The City takes your safety seriously and protects this community by disinfecting drinking water before it enters your home and disinfecting wastewater before it reenters our environment.\n\nChemicals are an important part of this industry.  The City is committed to using chlorine safely for the disinfection of your water and wastewater.  The City of Kissimmee along with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would like the public to know about the chemicals that may be stored in the community.\n\nSouth Bermuda WRF operates a chlorination process to disinfect treated water at the chlorine contact chamber and the filter.  This process requires a total of 16,000 lbs. of chlorine in storage and in use.  As a result of the quantity of chlorine at this facility, and to ensure a safe environment for its employees and the public, the City complies with hundreds of regulatory standards at its treatment facilities.  Providing and RMP for its treatment facilities is one way in which the City complies.\n\nThis facility typically employs four (4) persons on-site full-time 24-hours per day, seven (7) days per week.  The city staff routinely checks and maintains the chlorination equipment to prevent accidents.  Plant operators are trained to respond to leaks, receive 24-hour training to \"Technician\" level per OSHA Standard.  Annually operators receive an 8-hour refresher course.  All other employees that may come in contact with chlorine receive instruction to identify chlorine leaks and initiate response procedures.\n\nThe Cit"

      "SummaryText": "y and EPA would like to inform the public of the measures taken to assure public safety.  In the rare event of a chemical release, the City is knowledgeable of the potential affected area  so that they may implement a response system that will minimize the affects of the leak.  Part of being prepared is determining, through a dispersion model (RMP* Comp) provided by EPA, the possible limits of influence for a hypothetical release scenario.  Two (2) models were obtained one (1) using a \"worst case\" scenario as stipulated by EPA and another \"alternate case\" scenario which predicts a possible outcome for a more reasonable, yet conservative, release scenario.\n\nFor the worst case scenario the model assumes that all safety equipment fails and that an entire one-ton cylinder would release in ten (10) minutes under very stable atmospheric conditions and a low (three (3) mph) wind speed.  The distance to endpoint for this model is 0.9 miles.\n\nFor the alternate release scenario, it is assumed that all safety equipment fails and that an entire one-ton cylinder would release in ten (10) minutes under moderately stable atmospheric conditions and a six (6) mph wind.  The distance to endpoint for this model is 0.2 miles.\n\nThis facility is equipped with a chlorine scrubber which should prevent any release outside of the enclosed chlorine storage facility.  In addition, the chlorine storage facility is equipped with a chlorine leak detector which sends an alarm to the Operations Building in the event of a chlorine release.\n\nThe City has established a Safety Management Plan which complies with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The Plan includes information and instruction on handling chemicals at the City's treatment facilities along with a Hazard Communication Program, Chlorine Handling Policy and Procedures, and Chlorine Information and Instructional Guides.\n\nThis facility has had no reportable accidents within the last five (5) years.  The City, however, is committed to keeping i"

The facility staff are trained in safe handling of chlorine equipment and cylinders and responding to leaking chlorine equipment.  The City has also held public outreach seminars to make the public aware of this and other similar facilities in the area.\n\nThe City continuously strives for quality water and wastewater treatment and the safest conditions possible to protect its community."
