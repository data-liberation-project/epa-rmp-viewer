This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Watco Refugio. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our Emergency Action Plan is used to mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Miller Environmental which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWatco Refugio's primary activities include storing and coordinating shipping destinations of train rail cars which contain regulated substances. There are 10 regulated substances present at Watco Refugio in quantities grater than or equal to their threshold quantities. These substances are listed as follows with their CAS numbers in parenthesis:\n1-Chloropropene (590-21-6)\n2-Chloropropane (75-29-6)\n2-Chloropropene (557-98-2)\nAcrylonitrile (107-13-1)\nAnhydrous Hydrogen Chloride (7647-01-0)\nChlorine (7782-50-5)\nChloroform (67-66-3)\nEpichlorohydrin (106-89-8)\nMethyl Chloride (74-87-3)\nPropylene (115-07-1)\n\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nWatco Refugio has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This process is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at Watco Refugio.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWatco maintains Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for each regulated substance which describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\nWatco conducted an initial study to ensur"

This study was performed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise contained as required in the regulation. Watco plans to ensure the process hazards analysis is updated at least every 5 years and/or after a major process change has occurred.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures are kept and maintained at the Refugio Terminal. These procedures address each step of the operating phase including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following a turnaround. These procedures are easily accessible onsite to all Watco personnel. The procedures are reviewed regularly on a schedule maintained by Watco. These reviews ensure that safety and health considerations are considered to maintain a safe working operation for personnel and local surroundings.\n\nTraining\nWatco has a training program in place that ensures personnel are competent in the operating procedures and hazards associated with this process. New employees receive initial training and refresher training is required by all employees at least every three years. The specific training topics and frequency are maintained with Watco's \"Training Topics Matrix\".\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWatco has written maintenance procedures for the facility to ensure continuing proper function. Tank rail cars are inspected upon arrival for any deficiencies. If any deficiencies are found, Watco personnel contact the rail car owner for instructions on how the car will be repaired and by which rail car shop. Watco personnel do not personally perform maintenance on any rail cars.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
