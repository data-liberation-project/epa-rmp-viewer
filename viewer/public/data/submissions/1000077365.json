      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from the accidental release of hazardous substances. The Risk Management Program Rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Sharyland WSC Water Treatment Plant (WTP) No.2 falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine. The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation. Sharyland WSC personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Program Plan (ARPP) that contains the following required information.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nA hazards assessment that establishes the worst case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFR Subpart B).\n\n\n\nA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazards review, operating procedures, training,maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation (40 CFR Subpart C).\n\n\n\nAn emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\n\n\n\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the Sharyland WSC WTP No. 2.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coor"

In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the City of McAllen Fire Department. Plant staff will relay information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant gates. Plant staff will await the fire department to inform and update its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process. The plant regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 8 one-ton cylinders and one 150 lb. cylinder of chlorine at its facility that is stored outside. This is above the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the EPA.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nFour raw water pumps take suction from a terminal reservoir located at the water treatment plant site. From there, the water flows into a raw water structure where the pumps convey water into a rapid mix chamber and then into a splitter box where the flow splits into four identical treatment trains. Each treatment train consists of two flocculation chambers, two sedimentation basins and two mixed media filters. After the treatment trains, the water combines to supply a transfer clearwell. From the clearwell, two transfer pumps supply two ground storage tanks. Five high service pumps take suction from the storage tanks to supply the distribution.\n\n \n\nLiquid ammonium sulfate is applied after the raw water structure but before the rapid mix. Liquid alum and chlorine dioxide are applied at the rapid mix chamber, and gas chlorine is injected at the splitter box. Post disinfection with gas chlorine is applied ahead of the ground storage tanks as needed.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Sharyland WSC WTP Plant No. 2 accident history was reviewed from February 2014 to February 2019. During this period, no accidental releases of chl"

The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Plant operators are required to make multiple rounds of inspection specifically within 2 hours after a chlorine gas cylinder is put into initial use and consistently continue regular monitoring.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the designated Fire Department is trained to respond to the situation. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant's evacuation plan and (3) a detailed description for the emergency responders' plan for handling such as an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe City of McAllen Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant's emergency.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe water treatment plant will continue to train plant personnel in chlorine safety procedures by attending classes and safety meetings. The use of personal protection equipment (self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, clothing) shall always be emphasized.\n\n\n\nCAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant No. 2 continues to improve its processes providing a safer environment for staff and the surrounding community it serves. As part of a 2018 capital improvement plan, phase 1 consists of chemical injection improvements which addresses strategic treatment as recommended by a recent Corrosion Control Study conducted in 2018. Phase 2 will consist of a chlorine scrubber, however, some of the provisions for the scrubber will be incorporated in phase 1.
