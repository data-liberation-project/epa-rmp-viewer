We use a combination of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, DUCRP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  The document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\n(b) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nDUCRP is designed to process produced gas and recycle CO2 back to our field injection operations.  During our process, we recover natural gas liquids (NGL) and strip  hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the gas stream.  We utilize propane as a cooling agent for the process stream and we treat our cooling water with chlorine.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the DUCRP process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with only our propane inventory exceeding threshold quantities of the listed regulated substances.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDUCRP is a Program Level 3 and is required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place.  Processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Ad"

Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA's PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nThe DUCRP plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe DUCRP plant has on file a variety of technical documents.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level and composition) in Plant Data Books, Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) and start up manuals.  The plan ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.  The plant also maintains the design and construction data.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nTh"

The PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked to closure.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue at this frequency until the process in no longer operating.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe DUCRP plant maintains written process procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial Start-up, (2) Start-up after turnaround, (3) Normal Operations, (4) Normal Shutdown (5) Emergency Shutdown (6) Emergency Operations (7) Temporary Operations (8) Operating Limits (9)Consequences of Deviation (10)Safety Systems and their functions (11) Safety and Health considerations.  These procedures provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  They are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.  \n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the DUCRP has implemented training programs for all employees involved in operating a process.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work shift.  \n\n\n\nPre-Start Safety Review (PSSR):\n\nThe DUCRP plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for start-up prior to placing the equipment into service.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe DUCRP plant uses generally accepted industry recommended practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown (ESD) systems in a safe operating condition.  Maintenance and operating personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

This ensures that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices:\n\nThe DUCRP plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) visitors are given the plant safety orientation presentation and written exam annually, (3) a lock/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a procedure for safe excavation and trenching, (5)a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work permit), (6) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
