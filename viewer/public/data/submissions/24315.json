Our policy is to implement controls to prevent potential releases of hazardous chemicals.  However, if a release does occur, our well-trained personnel will respond to mitigate the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\nBASF FINA Petrochemicals complex is a joint venture between the BASF Corporation and ATOFINA Chemicals.  The site is operated by BASF and is located in Port Arthur, TX adjacent to the ATOFINA Refinery.  This facility receives feed from the adjacent Atofina refinery.  The naphtha feed is used to produce ethylene, propylene, benzene, and toluene.  This facility has the capacity to produce 2.2 billion pounds of ethylene and 1.9 billion pounds of propylene per year.  The process uses/produces the following chemicals that appear on the EPA regulated chemicals list, and have been identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics: None\n\n\n\nFlammables:  Methane, Acetylene, n-Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Propylene, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-\n\nButadiene, Propyne, 1-Pentene, Propadiene, 1,3-Pentadiene, 2-Pentene (E), 2-Pentene (Z)\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored or used within the complex which are above the inventory threshold limits as defined by the EPA. Therefore, BASF has no worst case (WCS) or alternate release scenario (ARS) identified for toxic chemicals in this Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nThe WCS associated with flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving 565000lbs of propylene/propane from a fractionation column.  This WCS assumes the entire inventory of this vessel is released over a 10 minute period, which subsequently vaporizes and ignites, resulting"

While this scenario is highly unlikely, and there are several controls to prevent such a release and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for mitigation was taken into account during evaluation of this scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.44 miles.  This was calculated using PHAST Professional v5.22.  This scenario has potential to reach off site.\n\n\n\nThe ACS associated with flammable substances is a jet flame involving a release of 59,500lbs of ethylene/ethane.  A line rupture at the acetylene converter due to temperature stresses would cause this release. Process Technician intervention is taken into account for active mitigation in evaluating this scenario. Process Technicians can shutdown the motive force for this scenario in less than ten minutes.  The maximum distance to a 1585Btu/hr/ft2 radiation level for this ACS is 0.09 miles.  This scenario was also modeled using PHAST.  This scenario has off site impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at BASF. Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accidental Release Prevention Program. \n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nBASF maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information.

In addition, safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) have been documented in the unit.  Operation teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and automated shutdown systems. \n\n\n\nBASF also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This documentation includes equipment information such as, materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings, etc.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes via Management of Change (MOC), to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nBASF has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled prior to the design phase. Each process is systematically examined during this process to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls and safeguards are in place to manage and/or mitigate these hazards. \n\n\n\nBASF primarily uses the HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform process hazard analysis. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the premier systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.

The resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\n\n\nProvisions are in place for the updating and revalidating of the PHA results to confirm that process controls and/or hazards have not deviated significantly from the original design safety features.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nBASF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as  (1) commissioning/first time startup , (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) emergency shutdown, and (6) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by Process Technicians and provide a basis for consistent training of new Process Technicians.

BASF incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. All equipment is inspected to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\n\nBASF has a comprehensive system to manage change. The MOC procedure applies to the installation of, and/or modifications to equipment, facilities, procedures, chemicals, and technology. Changes are reviewed by operations management to (1) verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The overall Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. BASF has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Port Arthur fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, BASF conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOngoing Work permit training\n\nOngoing Environmental a"
