These standards are applicable to all three of the processes described in this RMP.\r\n\r\nStandards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.111 and 119 are applicable to one of the operations at this facility because the facility may use a contractor to blend fertilizers using anhydrous ammonia above the threshold quantity as one of the raw ingredients.\r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia from the Facility which is located approximately 2 miles north of the City of Pasco.  The physical address to the Facility is 1010 Kartchner, Pasco, WA 99301.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nB.\tPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this RMP as part of a 5-year resubmission.  All relevant sections for the Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).  Specifically, the RMP is being updated as part of the standard 5-year resubmission and to anticipate a possible increase in the quantity of aqueous ammonia stored in an onsite tank to support a fertilizer blending process.\r\n\r\nC.\tFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and that potentially operates three (4) covered processes that include (1) Storage and Handling of Aqueous Ammoni"

Aqueous ammonia (24.3% by weight) is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) and then transferred into a single 14,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs the load-in transfer operation.  The aqueous ammonia is primarily used to make fertilizer blends in an onsite stationary blender operated by Helena personnel.   Anhydrous ammonia is also transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon) where it is connected to a blender by an Independent Contractor to make fertilizer products.  The Railcar Storage of anhydrous ammonia is included as a prospective process.\r\n\r\nD.\tOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the three covered processes at the facility.  \r\n\r\nD.1\tPROCESS 1\r\n\r\nProcess 1 is the storage and handling of aqueous ammonia (AqA).  The worst case scenario release assumes that all the contents at the administrative capacity of the 14,000 gallon storage tank are released.  The release was assumed to occur instantaneously and fill the surface area of the diked containment.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the AqA Storage and Handling process as well.  The alternative release for the AqA Storage and Handling process assumes that a hose break occurs during transfer operations and fills the surface of the loading pad instantaneously.\r\n\r\nD.2\tPROCESS 2\r\n\r\nProcess 2 is the blending of AqA with other ingredients to make fertilizer products.

The alternative release for the AqA Blending process assumes that a pipe break occurs during transfer operations and spills 760 gallons of AqA inside the containment area.\r\n\r\nD.3\tPROCESS 3\r\n\r\nProcess 3 is the blending of anhydrous ammonia (AA) with other ingredients to make fertilizer blends.  The worst case scenario release assumes that all the contents at the administrative capacity of a 34,000 gallon railcar are released even though it is expected that most of the time the blender will be connected to a 9,600 gallon commercial tanker truck.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the AA Blending process as well.  The alternative release for the AA Blending process assumes a 2-minute release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during the blending process.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted for all of the alternative scenarios that although these events are classified as an alternative scenarios, even these accident are unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment and operating procedures that Helena and its contractors use to safeguard ammonia operations.\r\n\r\nD.4\tPROCESS 4\r\n\r\nProcess 4 is the onsite storage of anhydrous ammonia in a railcar.  The worst case  release scenario assumes that all the contents at the administrative capacity of a 34,000 gallon railcar are released.
