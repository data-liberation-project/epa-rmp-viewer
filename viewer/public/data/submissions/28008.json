Facility Policy.\n        \n        The owners, management and employees of Preister Ag Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Platte County(District 4 LEPC), and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 920,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.     Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n        a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n        b.     The alternate release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 27,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.78 miles.   (The most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves interven"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.31 miles).\n\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\",  published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.      Five-Year Accident History.\n\n         There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,  property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.       Emergency Action Plan.\n\n          The facility has:\n\n          a.     A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n          b.     Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right- to-\n                  know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n          c.     If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.  With-in 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the    Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n                     1. The National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802\n                     2. Nebraska State Environmental Agency\n  \n7.       Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility."
