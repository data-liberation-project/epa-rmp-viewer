      "SummaryText": "MCB Camp Pendleton (Base) is the United States Marine Corps' largest amphibious assault training facility.  The Base covers an area of approximately 125,000 acres and is populated by over 40,000 military personnel and civilian employees in addition to numerous military dependents.  The Base provides its own water supply and wastewater treatment facilities within its boundaries.  Disinfection is therefore necessary to reduce the potential for transmission of infectious diseases.  Chlorination has long been the accepted and preferred method of disinfection for both water and wastewater in the United States.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure during handling and, to protect the health of persons on MCB Camp Pendleton and in the surrounding communities.\n\n1.1  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAccidental release prevention for the MCB Camp Pendleton systems is dependent on developed chlorine handling procedures, safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, and staff training.  Base facilities have been assessed against the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 55 - Storage, Use and Handling of Compressed and Liquefied Gases in Portable Cylinders, and it is Base policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.   Each chlorine system is enclosed in a locked building and access is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.  Building 17831 is clearly signed \"Danger Chlorine\" to reduce unauthorized entry.  An Emergency Response Program has been developed to respond to both worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  The emergency response actions involves system operators and maintenance staff, the Base Fire Department, and off-site expertise from the San Diego County Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT), when necessary.  In addition, the Assistant Chief of St"

      "SummaryText": "aff, Environmental Security (AC/S, Environmental Security) serves as the focal point for notifying the appropriate agencies and providing information to the public.\n\nThe accidental release protection for the chlorine systems also involves a prevention program that includes:\n\n7 Documenting process safety information\n7 Conduct a process hazard analysis\n7 Using operating procedures\n7 Implementing a maintenance program\n7 Conducting incident investigations\n7 Conducting compliance audits\n \n1.2  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nBuilding 17831, Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) 2, houses two (2), one-ton containers on-line and one (1), one-ton container in storage for a maximum amount of 6,000 pounds.  Chlorine is used at this facility for wastewater disinfection.  \n \n \n1.3  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n \nU.S. EPA regulations require MCB Camp Pendleton to conduct an off-site consequence analysis to provide information to the public and government agencies about the potential consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) consists of two elements:\n \n7 Worst-case release scenario\n7 Alternative release scenario\n\n1.3.1  Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nU.S. EPA regulations require the evaluation of a worst-case release scenario consisting of a release from the largest vessel in the system over a ten minute period under conservative weather conditions.  Therefore, an analysis was made of the entire contents of an one-ton container releasing a rate of 200 pounds per minute, under weather condition prescribed by the U.S. EPA as Class F stability and wind speed of 1.5 meters/second.  The release conditions were evaluated to determine the distance away from the systems where a maximum airborne concentration of 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm) would exist.  This airborne concentration has been determin"

Building 17831 is located in an urban setting and has a toxic endpoint distance of 1.3 miles.  An evaluation of this distance determined that several public receptors, offsite impacts, are likely to be affected during this worst-case release scenario. \n \n1.3.2  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative involves mechanical failure of a fusible plug.  As a safety relief device, 1-ton chlorine containers have six fusible metal plugs, three on each end, spaced 120: apart.  Assuming a scenario where the malfunctioning plug is located in the lowest position (closest to the ground), a liquid chlorine release could result.  Based on U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (October 1998), a 0.3-inch opening would result in a release rate of 240 lbs/min and an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.  The more common weather conditions of Class D stability, 25: Celsius (77: Fahrenheit) temperature, and wind speed of 3.0 meters/second are assumed for the alternative scenario.  Evaluation of the alternative zone of vulnerability for Building 17831 indicates that public receptors could be impacted.\n \n \n1.4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nMCB Camp Pendleton has taken steps so that the chlorine systems comply with U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  Building upgrades are being planned or considered for building 17831 and are described in Section 1.7.\n \nMCB Camp Pendleton has developed"
