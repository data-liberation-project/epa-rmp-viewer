      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Nu-Foam Products, Inc. (Nu-Foam) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to seven standby railcars) at our plant is about 750,000 l"

      "SummaryText": "b.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA??A???A?s risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA??A???A?s threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\n(DELETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 4/9/2004 Rulemaking)\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA??A???A?s Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA's process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n??A???A? Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes, and equipment\n \n??A???A? Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n \n??A???A? Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n \n??A???A? Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n \n??A???A?

Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential, are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the plant to help prevent recurrence\n\n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI-using process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and management system failures.\n \n In addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain or control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n \n??A???A? Release Detection \n \n??A???A? Process alarms (e.g., high level alarms and flow cutoff relays on the TDI storage tanks)\n??A???A?

Our Emergency Action Program/Contingency Plan includes procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities, by using management of change procedures.
