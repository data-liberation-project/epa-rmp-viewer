The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold \r\nstorage refrigerant chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in \r\nhandling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing \r\nthe threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia \r\ncombined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \r\n\r\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services \r\nGroup, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Dallas \r\nCounty Emergency Planning Commission, 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies, the Dallas Fire Department, then the notification of Derrick Jackson, Maintenance Manager @ 214-548-9709 (24 Hours) of CSM Bakery Products, the Dallas Fire Department and Dallas Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Dallas County LEPC.  \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in storage vessels located in the Compressor room of the facility and outside in the Controlled Pressure Receiver.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Co"

Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at the 10741 Miller Road location is anhydrous ammonia.  \r\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 20,485 pounds.  \r\nThis amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of a vessel when filled to the greatest amount \r\nallowed would release 20,485 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the 10741 Miller Road location.\r\nPassive mitigation was considered for this scenario. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 1.7 miles.  This location is classified as urban due to the amounts of obstructions around the site.\r\n\r\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility. An estimation, based on the operational flow rate, cross section area of pipe, operational pressure of pipe, and the change in elevation of the pipe. Using the RMP Comp software, a release from this type of pipe would result in a release of approximately 81.14 pounds per minute released into the atmosphere.  This release could be due to mechanical error. This amount of vapor ammonia release would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 miles.  \r\n\r\nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \r\napplicable state codes and regulations. \r\n\r\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services \r\nGroup, Inc.
