The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nPool Chlor of Tempe maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1965.  The process is located at 411 W. Gemini, Tempe, Arizona 85283.  The chlorine system for Pool Chlor of Tempe consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20 pound cylinders.  Below provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine Tanks (one ton containers)\n(6 - Operational Amount)\n(8 - Maximum that can be stored) Located at the south end of the facility\n\nChlorine Tank (20 lb. container)\n(150 - Maximum that can be stored): Located at the south end of the facility\n\nFilling Manifold: Located at the south end of the facility\n\nScrubber Sytem: Located at the south end of the facility.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 16,000 pounds.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pound"

The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool Chlor of Tempe has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five year accident history investigation (June 1994) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Pool Chlor of Tempe's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Pool Chlor of Tempe has a B-kit available at the facility in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the faci"

The PHA was comprised of a session that included a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.  The recommendations below have been completed as of June 2, 1999.\n\nR01 Review the operating procedures to ensure that they are an accurate representation.\n\nR02  Prepare a certification for the existing operators to satisfy the initial training requirements (Grandfather Clause).\n\nR03  Include in the operation procedures to set cones around the filling station when transferring chlorine to alert approaching drivers that chlorine transferring is taking place.\n\nR04  Read the Mechanical Integrity section to verify that the inspections/testing applies to Pool Chlor of Tempe.\n\nR05  Consider labeling valves on the filling station to correspond to the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram in Appendix B.\n\nR06  Consider the feasibility of installing a wind sock.\n\nR07  Verify the validity of the Emergency Response Plan in the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program.\n\nR08  Verify that a fire alarm is present for the building."
