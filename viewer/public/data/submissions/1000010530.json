This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Ogden Terminal that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Ogden Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline and propane storage/loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Ogden Terminal has a single Department of Transportation regulated pipeline that is routed into the facility.

These tanks are used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also have capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.\n\nAll of the previously mentioned tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 85% of their capacity.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials coverred by the RMP Rule are used at Ogden Terminal. \n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which is delivered into four storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline.  This material is routed from these tanks to the two truck transport loading docks for wholesale distribution or to propane retailers.\n\nA small quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks, but is stored at Ogden Terminal below the threshold quantity specified in the Risk Management Program regulation.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Ogden Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nAt the present time there are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Ogden Terminal.\n\nWorse Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of a propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warnin"

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at its normal flow rate for 10 minutes after the line break.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the RMP registrationdata elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Boone County Emergency Management, Boone County Sheriff's Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise"

The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Boone County Sheriff's Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shut down remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.  A third party contractor, 3E Company is under contract to contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention program, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nAs a part of the prevention efforts, there are a number of programs in which Enterprise employees participate.  A training program has been developed in which Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nThere is an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior "
