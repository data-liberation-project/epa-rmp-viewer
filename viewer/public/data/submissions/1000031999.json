The Portland Terminal complies with National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Portland, ME Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Portland Terminal is a bulk liquefied petroleum gas terminal that receives propane by rail car.  Propane is stored at the Portland Terminal and distributed by customer truck transports.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe  Portland Terminal has developed and implemented the all the elements of the EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements, Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulations.  The Portland Terminal adheres to the National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements for LP-Gas Storage and all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI):  The Portland Terminal has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes.  The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.  The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made using management of changes and pre-startup safety reviews.\n\n\n\nAccurate and complete process safety inf"

Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Portland Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards involved in the processes.  Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Portland Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\n\n\nAs a minimum the Portland Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\n\n\n\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The Portland Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved and documented by management.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (OP):  The Portland Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.\n\nThe Portland Terminal written operating pro"

Initial training insures that new or reassigned personnel are trained in an overview of the process and operating procedures.  Refresher training is performed at least every three (3) years to ensure that the operator understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.  Employees are tested to demonstrate their understanding of the training and competency.\n\n\n\nContractors:  The Portland Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that contractors used to supplement its workforce to perform maintenance, renovation"
