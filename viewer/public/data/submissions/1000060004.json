      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan has been prepared for the AMVAC pesticide manufacturing facility located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The plan has been prepared in accordance with section 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials (AHMs).  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by the AMVAC Chemical Corporation, Axis Plant, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP regulation and the relevent portions of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management regulations.\n\n\n\nThe AMVAC Axis facility was originally a portion of the Dupont Mobile Manufacturing Center.  It was purchased from Dupont by AMVAC on 5-18-2001.  The necessary documentation for the facility to comply with the RMP legislation was a part of that purchase agreement.  All of the Hazard and Operability Studies and Process Hazard Analysies were originally documented by Dupont and they have all been reviewed AMVAC in preparation of this RMP.  The AMVAC Axis plant and the Dupont MMC are on a common site.  All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency teams from both companies.\n\n\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\n\n1.  Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\n\n2.  Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\n\n3.  Operating in a manner which meets or exceeds existing laws and regulations and reflects a high level of concern and respect for the local community.\n\n4.  Investing in its future through aggressive research and development of new products and markets.\n\n5.

To achieve this we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\n\n\n\n2.0  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural pesticides at its plant located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the Dupont facility located on the common site.  The facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations, peripheral tanks and various ancilliary equipment.\n\nThe AMVAC Axis plant has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing.  The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nAs per 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4) the RMP must be updated no later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process above a threshold quantity. AMVAC plans to begin production of METAM/KPAM in Fall 2008 and two of the raw materials used in this process are covered chemicals. This updated RMP includes information to satisfy this requirement.

Worst case scenarios are mandated by the RMP rule.  For the regulated chemicals used at AMVAC these assumed a total failure of all systems in place and a total release of the chemical inventory.  The criteria used to choose an alternative release scenario is an attempt to more closely define a serious release episode that could conceivably occur, but is still substantially more severe than expected with the safety and monitoring equiment in use.  These scenarios include the following:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario for covered Toxic Substances:\n\n\n\nPhosphorus trichloride has been considered as a toxic substance considered for this scenario.  EPA Dispersion Model RMP*Comp was used for this determination.

Carbon disulfide is used as a raw material in the METAM/KPAM process. Carbon Disulfide is loaded from iso-containers into storage tank within concrete dike. The storage tank is equipped with level control device. A shutdown interlock on high level will close valve in the unload line. Unload pump will shut down on low flow (dry run protection). Loss of instrument air, electricity or nitrogen will also result in shutdown of unloading operations.\n\nEPA Dispersion Model RMP*Comp was used for this determination.  The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the CS2 storage tank (V303) with 30,000 gallon capacity. 315,000 pounds of CS2 would be released into its concrete dike.

Chlorine is delivered in 2,000 pound cylinders and are stored in racks capable of holding 12 cylinders. Worst case scenario involved release on entire cylinder, resulting in 2,000 pounds of chlorine being discharged over a 10 minute period. RMP*Comp model estimated the distance to toxic endpoint to be 0.9 miles. This is the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint specified for this regulated substance under the RMP rule. Area monitors are utilized to detect the presence of any chlorine vapors. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios for each covered Toxic Substance:\n\n\n\nAn alternate release scenario for carbon disulfide (METAM/KPAM process) would be a leak to develop in the transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor, resulting in 200 gallons of carbon disulfide spilled onto concrete floor. ALOHA 5.4.1 dispersion model was used to estimate alternative scenario releases for carbon disulfide.

An incident of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report. \n\n\n\nIsopropylamine [2-Propanamine] is a raw material used in the Nemacur process. Isopropylamine is identified as a flammable liquid in Table 3 of 40 CFR 68. Isopropylamine is stored in storage tank V-421.
