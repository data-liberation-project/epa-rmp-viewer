      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Loxahatchee River Environmental Control District (LRECD) operates a 11.0 mgd (average daily flow) wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) in Jupiter, Florida, that uses chemical treatment processes.  \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Program/Process Safety Management Plan (RMP/PSMP) provides guidelines to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of hazardous chemicals used at the WWTF.  The RMP/PSMP has been prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program requirements described in 40 CFR Part 68 and the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management requirements described in 29 CFR ?1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following chemicals are being used at the WWTF:  \n\n\n\n1.    Chlorine\n\n2.    Sodium Hydroxide (caustic)BELOW THE THRESHOLD\n\n3.    Sodium Hypochlorite BELOW THE THRESHOLD\n\n\n\nOf these chemicals, only chlorine is listed as \"Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" in the EPA and OSHA standards (refer to List of RMP Regulated Substances in Appendix B).  Chlorine is stored at the WWTF in the amount that exceeds the listed threshold quantity, see Table 1-1 and Figure 1-1.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for Loxahatchee River Environmental Control District Wastewater Treatment Facility are structured to reduce the risk of injury to employees and the public, from the accidental release of the regulated chemical chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine gas is used for effluent disinfection and is stored in ton containers in an enclosed building.  The chlorine building is kept closed at all times to contain any accidental releases.  There is a scrubber to actively mitigate any accidental release of chlorine contaminant up to 2000 pounds.  The scrubber is checked to see if it is operating during every workshift at the facility.  There are six chlorine detectors placed throughout the inside of the chlorine building to provide warning o"

      "SummaryText": "f any chlorine release.  At a concentration of 0.5 ppm, there is an audible alarm and a yellow warning light from the detector alarm panel inside the chlorine building.  At this concentration, the scrubber is set to automatically engage.  At 1.0 ppm, the detector alarm panel will emit an intermittent flashing red light.  The exterior alarm will sound and a rotating red strobe light will activate. SCADA Alarms will sound in the OPS control alerting operators to a high level alarm. \n\n\n\nThe facility has complied with Program 3 Prevention Program (subpart D of 40 cfr Part 68) of the EPA standard.  That is, the facility has:\n\n1.    Compiled process safety information.\n\n2.    Performed a process hazard analysis and has continuously updated the PHA when necessary.\n\n3.    Developed and implemented safe operating procedures.\n\n4.    Provided training through computer-based interactive training modules, on-site training, on the job training, and classroom training. \n\n5.    Established a mechanical integrity program.\n\n6.    Implemented management of change procedures.\n\n7.    Performed pre-startup safety reviews when necessary.\n\n8.    Performed compliance audits.\n\n9.    Established incident investigation procedures.\n\n10.    Established an employee participation plan.\n\n11.    Established hot work permit procedures.\n\n12.    Established a screening process for hiring contractors to work on or around the chlorination process.\n\n13.    Established contractor roles and performance criteria.\n\n\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental releases from the chlorination process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  Response to chlorine releases of 10 ppm or above is handled by Palm Beach County Hazmat/fire rescue.  The facility has established procedures for contacting them in such instances.  The faci"
