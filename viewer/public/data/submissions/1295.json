It is recieved in railcar and truck quantities and off loaded to a 19,500 gallon outdoor storage vessel. The storage tank is inside an approved dike and the dike outlet valve is managed under supervision and documented. It remains locked. The tank is three years old , in good condition and designed in accordance with  API standard 650 Appendix H. It is covered under Minnesota Above Ground Storage Tank regulations. The tank has a float type level guage and is monitored with alarm settings from the computer controlled operations system. All reciepts and transfers are recorded. The tank is also equipped with thermal expansion relief valves to prevent pressure buildup and flame arrestors. There is a no smoking or open flame policy for the whole facility. Hot work permit policies are  in place. The tank farm has been inspected by the Fire Marshall and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Operations is present in the area inspecting for leaks daily. Foam is present on site for fire fighting. A fire extinguisher is located on the loadout operators shack. Only fully qualified and trained personnel will conduct transfers. SOP's are written for this procedure and documentation is required. The use of grounding strap is the first connection made and the last disconnect to be made. Other safety equipment used are wheel chocks,  use of hand brakes, use of fall protection equipment and other PPE. A Spill Prevention and Countermeasure Control plan is in place.",

      "SummaryText": "     Chippewa Valley Ethanol Company manufactures 15 million gallons per year of ethyl alcohol which is used in motor fuels and industrial alcohol applications. Corn is used as the feedstock to the facility. The corn is dry-milled, mixed with waters and the starch is enzymatically converted to sugars. The corn / water / sugar mixture is then sterilized in a cooking process. After cooking, baker's yeast is added to ferment the sugars into etyhl alcohol. After fermentation is complete the ethyl alcohol is separated from the \"beer\" via a distillation process and further dehydrated using molecular sieve technology. Anhydrous Ethyl Alcohol is produced at a rate of 50,000 gallons per day. The remaining corn / water solution is centrifuged and the water soluble fraction is further evaporated (condensed) to a thick syrup and added to the wet grain portion which are dried together in a rotary drum dryer. The result is a co-product Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles marketed as an animal feed ingriedient.\n     Ethyl Alcohol is a substance that is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Due to tax structures on beverage alcohol any alcohol slated for fuel use must be  \"denatured\" with chemicals not suitable for human comsumption. The fuel grade ethanol is denatured with Natural Gasoline at a 5% by volume rate prior to leaving the facility. The industrial grade ethanol is bonded between CVEC and the customer through the use of Distilled Spirits Plant licensing program of the BATF. This industial non-denatured ethanol is marketed to customers in the food applications area.  Our products are manufactured in accordance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices and are approved as Kosher by the Orthodox Union.\n     CVEC is a responsible chemical manufacturer. Hazardous chemicals are used in the manufacturing process (sulfuric acid, ammonia, caustic soda).

We have an excellent fire protection system that includes a fire water retention pond and sprinkler systems in all process buildings. The distillation area (flammable, NFPA3) also has an alcohol foam deluge system. These systems are inspected monthly for integrity. The fire dept. is familiar with our facility and have been supplied with extra fire fighting foam. There have been no fires.\n     CVEC has had two emergencies. Neither had any on-site or off-site injuries or evacuations. The first in July 1997 involved being hit with >90 mph straight winds that imposed damage to our facility buildings. The second emergency in August 1998 involved a spill of 4500 gallons of Natural Gasoline to outside the dike area. The storage tank was overflowed during off-loading operations and a dike drain valve failed open. The spill was contained with minimal property damage.

An explosion of a railcar quantity of natural gasoline using calculations found in appendix C resulted in an impact endpoint of 0.45 miles. We are located in a rural environment and in this target range is a livestock auction yard and a grain elevator. For the alternate scenario a pool fire was choosen relative to the diminsions of the dike. This endpoint was 0.16 miles. No public receptors would be located in this range. Both scenarios could be considered low risk in reference to the public and community.\n     Being a responsible chemical manufacturer is no easy task. CVEC works very hard to keep abreast of the issues and remain in compliance with the respecting regulatory agencies. We strive everyday towards the goal of a safe and healthful workplace environment for our employees and the surrounding community."
