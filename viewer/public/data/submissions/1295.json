      "SummaryText": "     Chippewa Valley Ethanol Company manufactures 15 million gallons per year of ethyl alcohol which is used in motor fuels and industrial alcohol applications. Corn is used as the feedstock to the facility. The corn is dry-milled, mixed with waters and the starch is enzymatically converted to sugars. The corn / water / sugar mixture is then sterilized in a cooking process. After cooking, baker's yeast is added to ferment the sugars into etyhl alcohol. After fermentation is complete the ethyl alcohol is separated from the \"beer\" via a distillation process and further dehydrated using molecular sieve technology. Anhydrous Ethyl Alcohol is produced at a rate of 50,000 gallons per day. The remaining corn / water solution is centrifuged and the water soluble fraction is further evaporated (condensed) to a thick syrup and added to the wet grain portion which are dried together in a rotary drum dryer. The result is a co-product Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles marketed as an animal feed ingriedient.\n     Ethyl Alcohol is a substance that is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Due to tax structures on beverage alcohol any alcohol slated for fuel use must be  \"denatured\" with chemicals not suitable for human comsumption. The fuel grade ethanol is denatured with Natural Gasoline at a 5% by volume rate prior to leaving the facility. The industrial grade ethanol is bonded between CVEC and the customer through the use of Distilled Spirits Plant licensing program of the BATF. This industial non-denatured ethanol is marketed to customers in the food applications area.  Our products are manufactured in accordance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices and are approved as Kosher by the Orthodox Union.\n     CVEC is a responsible chemical manufacturer. Hazardous chemicals are used in the manufacturing process (sulfuric acid, ammonia, caustic soda). Chemical safety training is provided upon hiring along with other safety orientation topics and reviewed at lea"

CVEC is committed to a safe workplace and recently celebrated three years without a lost-time accident. Safety is the first topic to be covered at the daily morning process meeting and meetings are scheduled monthly to cover necessary topics in which every employee attends. Safety and health topics in our policy manual include:\n   * Hazardous communication          * Respiratory training                 * Lockout / Tagout\n   * Hearing conservation                  * Forklift training                         * Use of fire extinguishers\n   * Chemical Lab standard                * Confined Space Entry             * Use of PPE\n   * Emergency Responses               * Process Safety Management\nThese topics, at a minimum, are included in new employee safety orientation training as well as the necessary refresher training on each topic given annually at monthly safety meetings.\n     Because ethyl alcohol is a flammable liquid the distillation process area, final product storage tank area and load out operations are governed by Process Safety Management policies and procedures. The maximum intended inventory on site is 375,000 gallons. Natural Gasoline (the denaturant) is included in the PSM program. Natural Gasoline has a chemical composition of approximatly 30% -50% pentane which is a RMP listed flammable and has a fire rating of NFPA 4. We recieve this product in railcar quantities of 29,000 gallons and off load to a 19,000 gallon storage tank, as needed. The final product (95% ethanol / 5% natural gasoline) is loaded on railcars and tanker transport for dispatch to customers. The storage tanks are equipped with pressure relief devices and flame arrestors. This area also has Department of Transportation regulatory issues in which we comply.

CVEC has a hot work permit policy and a no smoking or open flame policy throughout the facility.\n     CVEC files a Toxic Chemical Release Inventory for SARA listed chemicals, reports under the Toxic Substance Contol Act and is in compliance with the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act 302, 304, 311 and 312. Our facility generates no process waste, all waters are recycled. We do have a NPDES permit for non-contact cooling and boiler water blowdowns and an air quality permit, both with the state of Minnesota.\n     Currently CVEC's emergency response program is coordinated with the local fire department. Emergency procedures are written for tornados, spills and fire, all of which require first call 911. Specific emergency shutdown operating procedures are included in the PSM areas. We have an excellent fire protection system that includes a fire water retention pond and sprinkler systems in all process buildings. The distillation area (flammable, NFPA3) also has an alcohol foam deluge system. These systems are inspected monthly for integrity. The fire dept. is familiar with our facility and have been supplied with extra fire fighting foam. There have been no fires.\n     CVEC has had two emergencies. Neither had any on-site or off-site injuries or evacuations. The first in July 1997 involved being hit with >90 mph straight winds that imposed damage to our facility buildings. The second emergency in August 1998 involved a spill of 4500 gallons of Natural Gasoline to outside the dike area. The storage tank was overflowed during off-loading operations and a dike drain valve failed open. The spill was contained with minimal property damage. A Spill Prevention Countermeasure & Control Plan has been written and employee training given to ensure spill prevention.

CVEC is also considering some operations or technician level training for emergency responses so we can work with the local responders.\n     A worst case scenario for CVEC would be described as a vapor cloud. An explosion of a railcar quantity of natural gasoline using calculations found in appendix C resulted in an impact endpoint of 0.45 miles. We are located in a rural environment and in this target range is a livestock auction yard and a grain elevator. For the alternate scenario a pool fire was choosen relative to the diminsions of the dike. This endpoint was 0.16 miles. No public receptors would be located in this range. Both scenarios could be considered low risk in reference to the public and community.\n     Being a responsible chemical manufacturer is no easy task. CVEC works very hard to keep abreast of the issues and remain in compliance with the respecting regulatory agencies. We strive everyday towards the goal of a safe and healthful workplace environment for our employees and the surrounding community."
