This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Shoshoni Rail Terminal is utilized to store liquefied propane in two above ground bullet tanks. One compressor unit is used to unload tank cars into storage bullet tanks or directly into trucks. When not directly loaded from railcar, trucks are loaded using one loading pump for transfer of the liquid propane from each storage bullet tank to the truck. \r\n\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; propane. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nProcesses at the Shoshoni Rail Terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program 3 (RMP) regulation. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Shoshoni Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners LP primarily used the What If technique to perform this evaluation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per Crestwood's Risk Management Protocol.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Shoshoni Rail Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the terminal, or at minimum every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nShoshoni Rail Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, s"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Shoshoni Rail Terminal maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Shoshoni Rail Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Shoshoni Rail Terminal uses contr"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Crestwood has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nCrestwood conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Crestwood periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted on a periodic basis.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Shoshoni Rail Terminal have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n \r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Shoshoni Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Shoshoni Rail Terminal has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1.\tTanks are gauged\r\n2.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure indicators \r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere to prevent t"

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Shoshoni Rail Terminal is coordinated with the Fremont County Sheriff. Their contact number is (307-332-5611). The Shoshoni Rail Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability.
