The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nMEC will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in,or could reasonably be expected to result in,the release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors).\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, MEC will conduct a compliance audit every three years. The facility will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\r\n\r\nAdditional Safety Systems\r\nMEC has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of  accidental releases. These systems include:\r\n1. Redundant instrumentation to monitor critical process parameters\r\n2. Redundant critical equipment\r\n3. Automated  shutdown systems\r\n4. Pressure relief valves\r\n5. Water deluge system to wash ammonia vapors out of the air\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nMEC began commercial operation in 2003.

Calpine also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\nMEC conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nMEC has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure  vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures,(3) conducting maintenance training,(4) performing and documenting inspections,(5) correcting identified equipment  deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits\r\nMEC has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety.

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nMEC maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency  operations, normal operations and temporary operations. The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.

      "SummaryText": "Morgan Energy Center (MEC) is a natural gas-fired combined-cycle cogeneration plant that is located in Decatur, Morgan County, Alabama.  MEC is capable of supplying steam to its host and generating a nominal capacity of 700 MW of electricity. The Plant consists of three combustion turbines equipped with heat recovery system (HRSG) and duct firing capability. The combustion turbine is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device that uses anhydrous ammonia for NOx emissions control.  The anhydrous ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment are addressed in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).\r\n\r\nMEC is subject to both the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68.10) and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119) since it exceeded the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, MEC is required to prepare an RMP and a PSM Plan. The requirements of both are essentially equivalent, therefore, this RMP will also serve as the facility PSM Plan. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on\u00ad site that exceed RMP thresholds.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia System Description\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in two dedicated, specially designed above ground storage tanks with an administrative policy and safeguards to not fill the tank beyond 85% capacity.  The anhydrous ammonia system is composed of five (5) major components: an unloading station, ammonia storage tank, ammonia vaporizer, ammonia flow control unit (AFCU) skid, and the SCR equipment.\r\nThe storage tank contains a mixture of liquid and vaporized ammonia under pressure. Ammonia saturation pressure in the tank varies as a function of ambient air temperature, and an ammonia vaporizer unit ensures that the correct pressure is maintained at all times. During periods of low ambient temperature, the pressure in the tank will drop to a minimum level at which point a vaporizer is used to maintain the temperature and thus the pressure in the tank.
