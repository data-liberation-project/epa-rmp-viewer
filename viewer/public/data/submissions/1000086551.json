Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nN. Specialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nSite specific detection and control equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the plant to:\r\n\r\n1. Contain/control a release\r\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\r\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\r\n\r\nThe following type of safety features are used in the covered process: \r\nRelease Detection\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n2. Automatic and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n3. Automatic plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare. \r\n4. Curing or diking to contain liquids releases\r\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation\r\n6. Atmospheric relief devices \r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1. Fire extinguishers only\r\n2.

Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nEPIC will promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation will be to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences, and forward these results to facility management for resolution.
