The Alternate case for the RMP was determined based on Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) assessments.  \r\n\r\nAs a newly constructed facility, this is Novo Nordisk - DAPI's first RMP submission and, with no RMP regulated source prior, there are no accidents to review. \r\n\r\nNovo Nordisk's Emergency response plan for the release of hazardous materials consists of multiple facets including operations response, emergency response team actions, and emergency services aid.  The emergency response plan instructs employees to take specific actions in the event of various environmental, health, and safety incidents including chemical release. The emergency response team is equipped and trained to respond to Hazmat incidents consistent with their level of training, up to and including calling upon the Regional Hazmat Team for incidents outside the scope of the training.  Johnston County Emergency Services and Wilson's Mills Fire Department serve as the first responders to Novo Nordisk, providing medical aid support for chemical releases and will deploy Regional Hazmat Team(s) when necessary. \r\n\r\nNovo Nordisk maintains communication with our local emergency services, including Johnston County Emergency Services and Emergency Management, Wilson's Mills Fire Department, and North Carolina Department of Public Safety and is committed to furthering their partnerships and capabilities through participation in regular, joint planning and exercises. \r\n\r\nNovo Nordisk understands that safety and the environment must undergo constant examination as part of our commitment to continuous improvement."
