The Fire Department and Police will handle public notification, under the control of the LEPC.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.

The facility is approximately 40 years old and was historically owned/operated by Quaker Oats Company, Van De Kamps (VDK) Frozen Foods, and Aurora Foods Corporation. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program was developed for the facility in 1994/1995 under Quaker Oats. The original Risk Management Program was developed by VDK using the existing PSM and the initial Risk Management Plan (RMP) was submitted to EPA on June 18, 1999.  Aurora Foods Corporation purchased the facility in June 2000 and a complete resubmission of the RMP report was submitted to EPA in July 2002.  Aurora emerged bankruptcy in March 2004, survived a merger and was renamed Pinnacle Foods Group Inc.  In October 2007 the company was renamed Pinnacle Foods Group LLC when the parent company and wholly owned subsidiaries merged.  The 2007 resubmittal is due to a PHA revalidation.  The 2018 resubmittal is for a five year update. In October of 2018, ConAgra Foods, Packaged Foods, LLC. acquired Pinnacle Foods facility. At the start of 2021, ConAgra started production of Milwaukee Sandwich Bros. pita sandwiches and OTP sausage biscuits. This plant expansion took place in the year of 2020 bringing 2 other facilities to the Jackson plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nConAgra is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner. ConAgra strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.

Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nIt is ConAgra Foods, Packaged Foods, LLC. policy that we will promote overall public and associate safety by developing, implementing and maintaining all required elements of the EPA's RMP provisions and OSHA's PSM standard regarding the storage, handling, and processing of anhydrous ammonia used at this facility.  The incorporation of these programs helps to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic incidents.  \r\n\r\nThis Facility incorporates a comprehensive management system to oversee the continued development, implementation and maintenance of the RMP. The Facility's Plant Manager is responsible for the implementation of the RMP.  In turn, he has designated the facility Plant Services Supervisor as PSM coordinator having overall authority for, and oversight of, the Facility RMP. As part of the PSM and Risk Management Program, the Facility has an Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Manual which provides instructions and responsibilities required of all facility personnel in case of the following plant emergencies: employee illness/injury, ammonia release, fire, and severe weather. The manual also provides procedures and responsibilities for controlled and emergency shutdowns of facility equipment. The management team is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures at the ConAgra facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on 102 acres in northeast Jackson, located in western Tennessee.

      "SummaryText": "ts, and fish.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers anhydrous ammonia hazardous; therefore, the properties, which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant, also necessitate certain safety precautions.  A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance (toxic or flammable) used at our facility.  We operate two refrigeration systems in tandem with an inventory of approximately 200,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this 2018 RMP re-submittal, there was one accidental release resulting in minor injuries within the past five years.  On May 28, 2014 at approximately 9:00 AM an ammonia release was reported which was stopped at approximately 9:58 M.  The amount released was estimated to be 1,800 pounds.  It was determined that a pump out valve on the Main Sub-Cooler was left open after a contractor replaced a pressure relief valve.  At the time, the temperature was 74F and the wind was 5 mph NW.  The plant was evacuated.  Two individuals were treated off-site by EMT and one was transported to the local hospital.  Notifications were made to all required Agencies.  Human error was a contributing factor to the release.  Measures to prevent and mitigate an issue in the future include activation of the King valve, expanding Haz-Mat team, improving communications, use of dual PRV's in the system and modifications to the Line Break policy and procedures.  All Plant Services associates have been trained on the modified policy and procedures.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFI"

      "SummaryText": "C PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon accepted and proven engineering design practices for a safe operating refrigeration plant.  The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ASHRAE Standard 15 and the National Electrical Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  Depending on location and use in the system, pressure vessels are ASME rated and fitted with either a single or dual safety relief valve as required by ASME.\r\n\r\nThe ConAgra Foods, Packaged Foods, LLC facility complies with applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Operators/Mechanics receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written tests and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge. \r\n\r\nConAgra has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Program for ammonia use and storage.  A management system has been established to maintain the elements of the PSM and Risk Management Programs.  Applicable written elements of the PSM and the Risk Management Program are readily accessible by employees.  An automatic ammonia detection system (ADS) also provides reliable notification of ammonia releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan and Procedures manual covers the ammonia refrigeration system in accordance with Process Safety and Risk Management.  Our emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.   If a release of ammonia is detected by the ADS"
