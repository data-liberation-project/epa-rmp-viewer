Accidental Release Preventions and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMerit Energy Company (Merit) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as regular and extensive personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facilities.  Merit's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to effectively control, contain and mitigate the release.  These commitments are demonstrated by the following HES Policy Statement and statement of HES Beliefs.\n\n\n\nHealth, Environment, and Safety Policy Statement\n\nMerit's commitment to high standards of Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) performance is supported by the 12 principles below.  Where applicable, we will use a management system approach designed around the \"Plan-Do-Check-Act\" framework and aligned with internationally recognized standards to achieve continual improvement in these areas.\n\nAccident Prevention: Our goal is an accident and injury free workplace, with 100 percent safe work practices and conditions throughout our operations.\n\nPrevention of Pollution & Resource Conservation: We are committed to environmental protection and emphasize to the extent practical resource conservation and the minimization of wastes, emissions, and releases throughout our operations.\n\nCommunities: We are dedicated to being a good neighbor in the communities where we work.  We will conduct our operations safely and responsibly and we will consult proactively with stakeholders on issues of mutual interest.\n\nSecurity and Emergency Preparedness: Security and emergency preparedness are vital functions and the responsibility of management, supervisors and employees at all levels.

Drilling, Completing, and Producing Oil and Gas in a SAFE, CLEAN, RESPONSIBLE, and cost effective manner is our primary business function.\n\n2. Our ATTITUDE, ACTIONS and EXPECTATIONS will make it obvious that we consider worker safety and environmental stewardship first in every operation.\n\n3. ALL WORKERS must communicate openly, honestly and often regarding HES goals, issues and workplace hazards. Every worker has the right and obligation to stop an operation if HES issues are not addressed.\n\n4. MANAGEMENT will support the workers' efforts through their actions and priorities to improve safety by providing training, seeking input, assisting in investigations and sharing lessons learned across the organization.\n\n5. By PREPARING to WORK SAFELY we will reduce the inherent safety risks in our activities to an acceptable level before an activity is undertaken.\n\n6. Every SAFETY SUGGESTION will be respectfully and thoughtfully considered and feedback will always be returned.\n\n7. Every incident and significant near hit will be REPORTED and INVESTIGATED appropriately to determine cause, effect and preventive measures.\n\n8. We will LEARN and IMPROVE from our observations and mistakes by openly communicating and seeking meaningful changes.\n\n9. Working safely is an INDIVIDUAL CHOICE that each of us must be committed to make continuously and without failure.\n\n10. Working safely and in an environmentally sound manner is a CONDITION of EMPLOYMENT.\n\n\n\nII. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Garland NGL Storage Facility is normally unmanned and consists of one remote 18,000-gallon capacity horizontal storage tank, used to store natural gas liquids for later sale by tank truck loading.  The NGLs are received by buried pipeline and are a NFPA Class 4 flammable liquids mixture.  Regulated substances can include methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, iso-butane, n-pentane, and iso-pentane in ad"

However, this tank can not be filled to capacity.  Working levels are limited to approximately 80% of capacity by the use of level alarms and an emergency shutdown to limit tank volumes.  Due to the remote location and limited quantities at this facility, this facility is believed to present minimal risk to the community. \n\n\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility consists of a pressurized storage tank located in a remote area, designed to store flammable liquids while preventing release.  During truck loading operations vapors are returned to the tank.  The tank vapor line is connected to a low pressure gas gathering system and utilizes a relief pressure regulator to maintain the tank at a low pressure.\n\n\n\nIV. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no facility reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility is included in Merit's comprehensive emergency response plan.   A drill on that plan was conducted in October, 2012.  Local community emergency response personnel were included in that drill.  In addition, personnel training is conducted annually.  Employees who may be involved in emergency response activities also receive annual 29 CFR 1910.210 HAZWOPER training. \n\n\n\nVI.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAnnual emergency response training and annual HazWoper training will be conducted in 2019."
