The valves are located on the two liquid chlorine supply lines that enter the chlorinator room.  As with the valves in the chlorine car enclosure, the shut-off valves in the control room are operated manually by pushing the emergency shut-off button located on the exterior wall of the chlorinator room.\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine car enclosure is activated when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, audio and visual alarms (both local and in the control room) are activated.  When the chlorine alarms are engaged, personnel are restricted from entering the chlorine area without the appropriate personnel protective equipment.  A chlorine leak detection and alarm system like the one in the chlorine car enclosure is located inside the chlorinator room.  \n\nA perimeter fence and locked security gates surround the John E. Preston WTP.  Security guards are posted 24 hours a day, at the entrances to the plant and at the chlorine storage area.  The John E. Preston WTP is also provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power to the entire facility.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe John E.

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.\nChlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in finished drinking water, to protect public health and to comply with state and federal water quality standards.  \n\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The John E. Preston WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals seriously, as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and an update to the RMP every five (5) years.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the chlorine process, including a description of the possible consequences if the procedures are not followed, and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of a chlorine release.\n\nThe following information is provided below in this RMP Executive Summary:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tGeneral Facility and regulated substance information.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSummary of the accidental release prevention program and"

Preston WTP is located at 1100 West 2nd Avenue in Hialeah, Florida.  John E. Preston WTP is bounded to the North by West 13th street, to the South by West 9th Street and the Hialeah Water Treatment Plant which uses chlorine stored at and delivered from John E. Preston WTP, and bounded to the west by West 3rd Avenue.  John E. Preston WTP covers 17.3 acres.  The facility stores chlorine which is regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.\n\nChlorine is delivered to John E. Preston WTP via 90-ton rail car by FEC Railroad.  The FEC delivers all rail cars via a spur to the John E. Preston chlorine rail car enclosure.  The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The rail car enclosure has a capacity of four cars but typically houses only two chlorine rail cars.  The chlorine system at John E. Preston WTP provides a total of approximately 13,000 pounds of chlorine per day to the softened water to maintain an average dose of 14 mg/L.  The chlorine rail cars at John E. Preston WTP also supply chlorine for the Hialeah WTP.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the John E. Preston WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe vapor pressure of the stored chlorine forces"

      "SummaryText": "the liquid through the tubing and into the manifold system. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the rail cars through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas Rotometer and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include, but are not limited to emergency shut-off valves, chlorine leak detectors, audio and visual alarm system, isolation valves, high and low temperature alarms, high and low pressure alarms, pressure regulators, expansion tanks, bursting disks, and pressure relief valves.  Chlorine Kit \u00c2\u00bfC\u00c2\u00bf and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus are available in the event of a chlorine release.  These major safety features are located in the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator room.\n\nEmergency shut-off valves are located at the rail car valve, and immediately after the monel transfer hose or \u00c2\u00bfwhip\u00c2\u00bf. Downstream of the manifold system there is also a pneumatically actuated emergency shut-off valve.  Pressing one of the emergency shut-off switches (kill switches) activates the emergency shut-off valves.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure and in"

      "SummaryText": "lude: startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown, startup after emergency shutdown, chlorine rail car receipt, chlorine rail car connection and chlorine rail car disconnection, and transferring chlorine rail car from standby to in-service.  All SOPs have been recently reviewed and updated.\n\nTraining\nJohn E. Preston WTP employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine processes are trained in the chlorine process and the applicable operating and maintenance procedures.  John E. Preston WTP ensures that each employee newly assigned to the chlorine process, is trained and tested to be competent in the process safety management, standard operating procedures, consequences of deviation from the SOPs, and chlorine process safety features.   Each employee involved in operating the chlorine system, has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities, including emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.\n\nManagement Personnel are trained on Process Safety Management and compliance with Federal and State Regulations pertaining to Risk Management Planning and Process Safety Management.  All on-site facility personnel that are not involved directly with the chlorine system are also trained in the MDWASD Emergency Action Plan, and the hazards of chlorine.\n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less, to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures. \n\nThe John E. Preston WTP prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, and provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person(s) administering the training. Many of MDWASD\u00c2\u00bfs safety classes are AWWA certified. \n\nContractors\nMDWASD John E. Preston WTP has procedures and policies in place that specify the information re"
