If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any releases to the population and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  Sargent Feed & Grain currently has seven full time employees.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmers.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility is approximately 446,700 pounds.  This amount includes our main storage tanks and nurse tanks.  During periods of non-operation, of this facility, local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections at various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\nThe major hazards identified in section 8.4.c, fire and explosion, would be from the propane dealers located adjacent to our facility.  There has been coordination between our facility and the owners of the propane facilities as to what action to take in the event of a release from either facility.\n\nThe major hazard identified in section 8.4.c, vehicle damage, could result from the fact that a city street runs through the center of our facility.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our main storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative-case release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.4 mile.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Require"
