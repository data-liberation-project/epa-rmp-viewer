      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\r\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. actively pursues a safe and healthy workplace in accordance with our corporate Safety and Health policy.  Management is actively involved with employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety and health program.  Managers participate with employees in ongoing safety and health program activities, including:\r\n1) Promoting safety and health through active personal example and committee participation;\r\n2) Providing safety and health education and training for employees, supervisors and managers; and\r\n3) Reviewing, updating and enforcing workplace safety and health rules.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc., located in Hastings, Nebraska, was constructed in 1984. Major expansions completed in 1993, 1999, 2006, & 2008 have resulted in the plant having the capacity to produce approximately 75 Mmgal per year of denatured fuel grade ethanol.  \r\nEthanol is produced by a fermentation process using corn or milo.  Chief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. processes approximately 73,000 bushels of grain per day.  In addition to ethanol production, the plant produces approx 600,000 tons per year of distiller's grains (both wet and dry) that is used as an animal feed.  Natural gasoline is used to denature the ethanol produced and is stored at our plant in a 30,000 gallon above ground storage tank within a 4.5 ft high diked secondary containment area.  \r\n\r\nSummary of Changes\r\nHistorically, anhydrous ammonia has been used at the facility in the process for pH adjustment and as a yeast nutrient.  On September 1, 2015 the anhydrous ammonia system was removed from service.  Urea has replaced ammonia as a yeast nutrient and pH adjustment by anhydrous ammonia is no longer needed. This RMP update removes anhydrous as a covered process. The facility emergency action/response plan was updated to remove on-site anhydrous ammonia releases from the plan."
