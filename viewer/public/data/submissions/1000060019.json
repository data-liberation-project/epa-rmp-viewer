The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\n        The owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Coop, Eakly, OK are committed to the prevention of any     \n\n        accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to \n\n        work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of \n\n        the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information:\n\n\n\n\n\n       A. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\n       B. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n\n          \n\n       C. The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds in our 30,000 gallon tank and 52,530 in our 12,000 gallon tank, or 183,855 \n\n          pounds combined.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 183,855 pounds is rounded to 180,000 pounds.        \n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\n\n\n        a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as \n\n           a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds which represents the volume\n\n           of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding \n\n           requirements of the RMP Submit Program, the 131,325 pounds is rounded to 130,000 pounds.  The distance to \n\n           the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 6.9 miles.  \n\n\n\n        b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential \n\n           incident)is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion \n\n           to 200 ppm"

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 1000060019,
      "SummaryText": ") is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\n        The facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous \n\n        Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the    \n\n        U.S.Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous \n\n        Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.    The Five-year Accident History:\n\n\n\n        a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n           A1. Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n\n\n           A2. To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n\n               property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\n        The facility has:\n\n\n\n        a.    A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\n        b.    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as \n\n                required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\n        Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the \n\n        maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for \n\n        implementation at this time.\n\n"
