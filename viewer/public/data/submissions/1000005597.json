This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye C02 Plant, located approximately from the intersection of Texas Camp road and State Highway 8, in Lovington, New Mexico, operates a variety of processes to extract natural gas liquids from casing head natural gas. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Buckeye CO2  Plant. Processes at the Buckeye CO2  Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s (OSHAs) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA). team.

In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations. maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Buckeye CO2  Plant currently has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Coordinator that assists in maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response? exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operator Procedure Manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant uses hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's), which are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazard of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution, Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2  Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes. In addition, the Buckeye CO2 Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Buckeye CO2 Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level, This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify demonstrate (e.g., via verbal and written tests, skills demonstration, etc.) that the operator understood the training.\n\n \n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant uses contractors to supplement its workf"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Buckeye CO2 Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye CO2 Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. This may require that a management of change team review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary.\n\n\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Buckeye CO2 Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.
