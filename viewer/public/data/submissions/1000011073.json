American Cold Storage NA-LP has been in operation at this facility for over 30 years, providing over 29 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nIn this facility, we use Anhydrous Ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This chemical must be used to provide cooling for the storage.  It is our policy to have programs in place dealing with safety precautions for handling these substances and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health, as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, as well as the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAmerican Cold Storage NA-LP is required to maintain low temperatures, which are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in the food storage areas of the plant.  American Cold Storage uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures. American Cold Storage NA-LP refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in two systems.  System #1 contains approximatly 5300lbs. System #1 may contain a maximum amount of 6,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The larger"

The two systems are located approximately 110ft apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, American Cold Storage has implemented several precautionary measures.  \n\n\n\nAmerican Cold Storage has implemented evaluated and engineered against anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are: process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Louisville Fire Department HazMat team responds to any ammonia release at the facility.  Five American Cold Storage NA-LP personnel are trained to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat).\n\n\n\nAmerican Cold Storage NA-LP has developed work order procedures and plans to develop standard operating procedures, which incorporate safety measures into the procedures, for all employees and contractors who have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety procedures were developed by the safety team and will be reviewed annually.  American Cold Storage NA-LP encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of key employee participation at meetings and an open door policy regarding concerns or suggestions.  Any changes to the operating procedures will be communicated to affected employees by following written management of change procedures established by American Cold Storage NA-LP .\n\n\n\nAmerican Cold Storage NA-LP understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; theref"
