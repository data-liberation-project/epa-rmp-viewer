By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the environment.  \n\nRisk Management Program\n\nThis facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s Risk Management Program Rule under the Clean Air Act of 1990.  The Risk Management Program Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a Risk Management Program.  The Program requirements include submission of a Risk Management Plan, hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, development of a process accidental release prevention program and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for  the Farmland Industries, Inc. Greenwood ammonia facility at Greenwood, NE.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nInitial construction and operation of the Greenwood Ammonia Facility began in 1973.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility is used as agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe Greenwood Ammonia Facility is a storage facility for anhydrous ammonia consisting of a 30,000 ton atmospheric pressure, refrigerated liquid storage tank with a dike for secondary containment, a product heater, refrigeration compressors and assorted vessels and piping.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only sub"

The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of facility activities.\n\nThe Greenwood process operators adhere to the requirements of PSM and have written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements including routine training and testing of employees, alarms to indicate operating conditions outside the norm and an off-hours phone notification system for abnormal conditions.  Additionally, the facility is equipped with perimeter sensors to continuously monitor potential emissions from the process.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in these programs throughout its years of operation.\n\nThe process operators are diligent in adhering to and maintaining the Process Safety/Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Greenwood Ammonia Facility has established an Emergency Response Program and has a written Emergency Response Plan as required by the Risk Management Program rule and other Environmental Protection Agency and OSHA rules.  This plan is coordinated with and made available to the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local emergency responders.\n\nThe operators of the facility are active participants in the Local Emergency Planning Committee and interact with various local agencies in emergency planning.  \n\nProcess operators receive annual training on the facility emergency response plan and also receive additional safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the emergency response plan.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires inclusion of the facility\u0012s five-year accident history for all"

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under the worst-case should not be considered a public danger zone.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium ni"

Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated liquid, atmospheric pressure storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike.\n\nFarmland\u0012s hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the facility\u0012s 30,000 ton refrigerated liquid storage tank.  As required by the rule, the worst-case release assumes that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank and subsequently evaporates from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) and the resulting end point distance is expected to be conservative.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and is extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of storage vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than  the hypothetical worst-case tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as in areas where refrigeration, loading and other transport activities occur.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the facility.  Also, operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the f"

The impact of such a release was modeled with the publicly available model (DEGADIS) which shows that the impact of the release would extend offsite under typical ambient conditions.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  In a formal procedure, conducted at least every five years, the process hazard analysis is updated and revalidated but review is also constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
