The Emergency Evacuation Assembly Areas for toxic releases are located at the truck garage break area and the main Break Room.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nDot Foods operates one (1) refrigeration system which uses approximately 12,000 lbs. anhydrous ammonia as the heat transfer fluid.   The refrigeration system is used to maintain cooling and freezing for warehouse products.  The refrigeration system began operation in March 1998 and was designed and constructed under the applicable fire and mechanical codes.\n\n\n\nThe system is a single-stage, multi-suction, economized mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes recirculated liquid feed to the evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for the 35?F Refrigerated Dock and Refrigerated Warehouse and for the -2?F Freezer Warehouse.  There are two rooms adjacent to the Freezer Warehouse, each with two (2) evaporator coil units that can be converted to/from refrigerated or frozen space.  The anhydrous ammonia also serves as a heat exchange medium for the under-floor glycol heating system.\n\n\n\nSystem components are connected with steel piping approved for ammonia refrigeration service and the system is controlled by the programmable logic controller (PLC), the microprocessors at the screw compre"

The Thermosiphon Receiver also supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver, which then supplies liquid to the High Temperature Recirculator for recirculated liquid cooling to the Evaporator coils.  As the liquid ammonia leaves the High Temperature Recirculator, an expansion valve reduces the temperature and pressure of the liquid to the coils to maintain a pre-determined pressure.\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia from the High Temperature Recirculator is supplied to the Low Temperature Recirculator through an expansion valve, which maintains the vessel at a lower pressure.  Liquid from the High Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the Truck Dock Evaporators and optionally to the Convertible Evaporators when high temperature cooling is desired in that space.   Liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the Freezer Evaporators and optionally to the Convertible Evaporators when low temperature cooling is desired in that space.\n\n\n\nPrior to entering the Evaporator coils, the ammonia expands and flashes to saturation"

Constant pressure to the High Temperature Recirculator is maintained with backpressure regulating valves, located before the economizer ports of the compressors.  The Low Temperature Recirculator pressure is maintained by the main suction pressure of the compressors.\n\n\n\nHigh temperature vapor from the High Temperature Recirculator provides economized suction to the compressors and low temperature vapor from the Low Temperature Recirculator provides low temperature suction.  High-pressure, high-temperature ammonia vapor discharge from the compressors provides hot gas for the glycol heat exchanger, hot gas defrost for the Evaporator coils, and high stage discharge to the Evaporative Condenser.  The heat of compression in the compressor discharge is removed in the Evaporative Condenser.  Liquid discharge from the glycol heat exchanger is returned to the thermosyphon supply line to the compressors.\n\n\n\nAn Autopurger periodically removes noncondensibles from the system.  The fire control box outside the Machine Room is operated by fire department personnel in the event of emergency.  The Ammonia Diffusion Tank is maintained full of water to absorb a system overpressure release from the vessel pressure relief valves.  Emergency E-stop switches are located outside each Machine Room entrance for emergency shutdown.
