Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance at the Arizona Public Service Company Redhawk Power Plant in the past five years. \n\n6.

Arizona Public Service Company has coordinated emergency response with the Maricopa County Emergency Planning Commission by submitting an Emergency Response Plan as required. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nArizona Public Service Company has an ongoing program of training, maintenance, and inspections in order to minimize the possibility of accidents. As part of ongoing safety practices regarding the ammonia system, the facility will evaluate procedures and implement recommendations as appropriate from ongoing review of operator training and inspection programs."

      "SummaryText": "The tanks are surrounded by individual walled containment basins that limits the exposed surface area and reduces the release rate for the 29.4 wt.% aqueous ammonia. Using EPA's RMP*comp and based on the assumption that the tank liquid will be equal to air temperature at 77\u00baF, the distance to toxic endpoint on is 0.3 miles.  This distance is contained within the property boundary.  As such, no public receptors are affected within the distance to the toxic endpoint, as a worst-case release from both locations are predicted to remain on-site and/or not reach a public receptor.\n\nUnder worst-case meteorology as per the guidance (1.5 m/s and F stability) and adjusting the release rate for release temperature, the resulting distance to toxic endpoint from Reference Table 10 is 0.4 miles (rural topography). This distance is contained within the property boundary except for the very northern extent of the distance to toxic endpoint for Unit 1 (extends about 300 feet (0.06 miles) off property). However, there are no public receptors in this area. The nearest public receptor is over 1.5 miles away from the property boundary to the northeast, which is well beyond the distance to the toxic endpoint. \n\nThe worst-case release from the storage tank is predicted to remain almost entirely on-site and is less than the distance to public or environmental receptors. The facility has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years, thus it qualifies for Program 1 and an alternate release scenario is not required. \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe aqueous ammonia system was designed to reduce potential off-site impacts by including two concrete dikes to provide 100% containment around the storage tanks. Operators will receive ongoing training in accident prevention and chemical safety, will conduct visual inspections of the ammonia system routinely, as well as perform maintenance recommended by the equipment manufacturers to reduce the risk of accidents."

      "SummaryText": "implemented policies and procedure that ensure our operations adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are supported at the highest level within the Company.  The facility is operated to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as to protect the environment.  To communicate this philosophy, APS has an ongoing environmental, health, and safety training program for employees.  In addition, a release such as those used for the worst-case scenarios is highly unlikely due to this ongoing training, preventive maintenance, inspections of the ammonia system, and mitigation measures.\n\n2.\tDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled \n\nThe Arizona Public Service Company Redhawk Power Plant is located in the western portion of Maricopa County. As mentioned, SCR systems are installed to control NOx from the two units. The SCR system utilizes a 29.4% solution of ammonia in water, ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia storage and handling system consists of two 25,000-gallon storage tanks (one for each unit), pumps, and piping to the vaporizer, which produces a uniform distribution of aqueous ammonia injected into the flue gas upstream of the SCR catalyst. The storage tanks will have a maximum design pressure of 30 psia, and both tanks are contained completely within individual walled containment basins designed to hold all of the tank contents. The tanks have an administrative fill limit of 95% (23,750 gallons each).  There are additional small ammonium hydroxide tanks on-site, but they do not meet the regulated substance threshold of 20%.  As such, they have been excluded from this discussion and this analysis.\n\n3. Worst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents of one of the storage tanks."

      "SummaryText": "APS Redhawk Power Plant\nSeptember 2022\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nThe following outlines the key components of the Risk Management Plan for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the Arizona Public Service Company's Redhawk Power Plant. The organization of this executive summary follows the elements listed in the U.S. EPA's RMP*eSubmit Users Manual, with a brief introduction. \n\nIntroduction \n\nArizona Public Service Company owns and operates the Arizona Public Service Company Redhawk Power Plant, an electric power generation facility located in western Maricopa County, Arizona. The facility consists of two combined-cycle units. This RMP covers these two units identified as Units 1 and 2. \n\nThese combined-cycle units have selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control systems installed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions. Ammonia with concentrations of 20% or higher is listed as a regulated substance under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. \n\nAs a result of the SCR NOx control system, the quantity of aqueous ammonia stored and used at the facility is greater than the Threshold Quantity, thus a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required. The aqueous ammonia system is identified as the only process at the facility that triggers RMP requirements. As explained in the following sections, even the highly unlikely worst-case release from the aqueous ammonia system will not result in the toxic endpoint reaching a public receptor.  However, in the interest of completeness, the following information discusses mitigation measures to avoid adverse consequences of a release to public receptors within the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nAPS is committed to operating the facility in a manner that promotes both the safety of our employees and the general public as well as being protective of the environment.  APS has adopted and"
