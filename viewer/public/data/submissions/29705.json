      "SummaryText": "The Speedway Water Works is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees and protecting the health of the surrounding community.  Speedway Water Works is a water treatment facility located in the Town of Speedway, Indiana.  Chlorine is the only current RMP regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is utilized for the disinfection of drinking water.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was conducted based on the recommended EPA parameters.  This scenario consisted of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine gas being released in 10 minutes.  The building enclosure was considered in the modeling which limited the release rate to 110 pounds per minute.  The worst-case release scenario resulted in off-site impact. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a bad connection with the 1-ton cylinder.  This scenario consisted of gaseous chlorine leaking out of the 5/16-inch valve body opening.  The release rate was 10.5 pounds per minute over a 60-minute duration.  The recommended EPA atmospheric paramenters were used in the modeling.  The building enclosure was considered.  The alternative release scenario resulted in off-site impact. \n\nThe accidental release prevention program for the Speedway Water Works consists of all the required prevention program 3 elements.  In the past five years, the Speedway Water Works has not had an accidental chlorine release.  The facility is included under the community emergency response plan.  Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nThis update of the RMP is due to modifications to the chlorination feed system.  The two existing chlorinators and associated appurtenances were replaced and a third chlorinator was added.  The chlorine leak detection system in the chlorine room was replaced and a new detector was added in the chlorinator room.  The ventilation system was replaced.  These improvements improve the overall safety and reliability of the chlorination system."
