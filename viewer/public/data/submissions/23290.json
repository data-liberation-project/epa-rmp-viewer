The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and D Stability modeling parameters.  \n\nb.  Ammonium Polyphosphate Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage tank in the process when filled to the greatest amount would release 60,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release of anhydrous ammonia from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe. \n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "John Taylor Fertilizers\nRio Linda Facility\n\n\n1.  Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Rio Linda facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 841 West Elkhorn Blvd., Rio Linda, California, 95673 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in two thirty-ton bullets at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 103,800 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is received and stored in two 168,000 gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 2,553,600 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  638,400 pounds.  \n\nAmmonium polyphosphate is produced at the site using anhydrous ammonia  and a 10-34-0 reactor. The end product, ammonium polyphosphate, is not a regulated substance. \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na.
