      "SummaryText": "Facility Description: \n\n - Sabine River Operation (SRO) is located approximately 2 miles south of the city of Orange, Tx on FM 1006. The site is located on 1,500 acres evenly divided between manufacturing processes, former employee recreation areas, and bio-oxidation ponds. A chain-link fence with proximity alarms, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24-hour security force secure the facility.\n\n\n\n - The site manufactures Ethylene and Ethylene Copolymer with support operations by Logistics (barge, rail, and trucks), and Energy/Environmental (site's power, water treatment, and bio-ponds operation). \n\n\n\nRevisions to the Plan:\n\n - Revisions to the May 9th, 2019 plan are being submitted on November 11, 2021 for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n - Company Name Change: Company name has changed from the Dow subsidiary \"Performance Materials NA, INC\" to \"The Dow Chemical Company\" due to merging of the two company entities on November 1, 2021. \n\n\n\n - Separation of The Dow Chemical Company and Heritage plans: The Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow\") completed a divestiture the site incinerator which is now covered under Heritage's plan. \n\n\n\n - Prevention Program Increases: The overall prevention programs were increased from four (4) to six (6). This accounts for the removal of the Site Environmental Services prevention program which covered solely the incinerator. In additional, the Ethylene Copolymers Unit was separated into three (3) individual prevention programs: C Unit, D Unit, and G Unit. This was based on each unit independently having their own management systems and PHA's. Also, under the Ethylene Copolymers Unit was the CSD Unit. This unit does not have any RMP regulated substance and thus is not included as a prevention program. \n\n\n\n - Process Boundary and Maximum Inventory Verification: The site performed a reverification of the process boundary and maximum inventories. The overall total processes were increased from 1 to 8. This is based on the EPA's definition of interconnec"

In addition, some of the previously denoted individual regulated substance quantities have been reduced to zero. This was due to the reclassification of process chemicals as a flammable mixture instead of reporting the components individually. The previous quantities are now represented in the Flammable Mixture #2. \n\n\n\n - Removal of Regulated Substances: Isoprene was removed from the plan as it has been verified to be below 1% in the chemical mixture pervious denoted as the by-product HAD (Heavy Aromatic Distillates). \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n - The Sabine River Operations site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the LEPC and City of Orange Fire Department which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n - The Dow Chemical Company Sabine River Operations site operates under multiple air permits. There is insufficient room in the registration section to list this information, so we are providing the information on the additional air permits over the covered processes: 1895, 2331, 2055, 1899, and 1882.\n\nSRO has eight (8) processes, twelve (12) programs and fifteen (15) regulated substances present at the stationary source. Out of the fifteen (15) substances, eleven (11) can be found within two (2) distinct flammable mixes denote"

There are two (2) worst-case toxic and three (3) worst-case flammable scenarios in this submittal. There are three (3) toxic alternative cases and two (2) flammable alternative cases. \n\n\n\n - All selected flammable scenarios were based on cases from Flammable Mix #1 and #2. For Flammable Mix #1, the worst-case models were based on the composition of the system as this material is a standard by-product from the Ethylene Unit. For the alternative cases, butane, with the highest heat of combustion was assumed to be 100% of the mixture. For Flammable Mix #2, no specific composition was used. All worst and alternative cases assumed 100% hydrogen, which has the highest heat of combustion in the mixture. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n - The SRO processes follow the requirements of applicable Corporate standards related to OHSA PSM and EPA RMP requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n - SRO site maintains detailed records of safety infor"

Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n - SRO conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening a Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA). A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n - For the purpose of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, SRO maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n - SRO has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n - SRO carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training on the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of existing processes are conducted.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating & maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup, and that all necessary personnel have been trained prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n - SRO conducts audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule and other applicable regulatory requirements are being followed and have been implemented properly.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n - SRO investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a serious release of a regulated substance.

The facility has a program for informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes, as well as the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform the facility of any hazards they may introduce or encounter while at the site.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n - SRO has not had any accidents to report as part of the RMP.   \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n - SRO maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan documents all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes within the processes at the facility that would require a modified emergency response. Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced in order to ensure that it is functioning properly at all times.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n - SRO continues to train site personnel on new safety procedures.
