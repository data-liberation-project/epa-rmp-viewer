The site is located on 1,500 acres evenly divided between manufacturing processes, former employee recreation areas, and bio-oxidation ponds. A chain-link fence with proximity alarms, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24-hour security force secure the facility.\n\n\n\n - The site manufactures Ethylene and Ethylene Copolymer with support operations by Logistics (barge, rail, and trucks), and Energy/Environmental (site's power, water treatment, and bio-ponds operation). \n\n\n\nRevisions to the Plan:\n\n - Revisions to the May 9th, 2019 plan are being submitted on November 11, 2021 for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n - Company Name Change: Company name has changed from the Dow subsidiary \"Performance Materials NA, INC\" to \"The Dow Chemical Company\" due to merging of the two company entities on November 1, 2021. \n\n\n\n - Separation of The Dow Chemical Company and Heritage plans: The Dow Chemical Company (\"Dow\") completed a divestiture the site incinerator which is now covered under Heritage's plan. \n\n\n\n - Prevention Program Increases: The overall prevention programs were increased from four (4) to six (6). This accounts for the removal of the Site Environmental Services prevention program which covered solely the incinerator. In additional, the Ethylene Copolymers Unit was separated into three (3) individual prevention programs: C Unit, D Unit, and G Unit. This was based on each unit independently having their own management systems and PHA's. Also, under the Ethylene Copolymers Unit was the CSD Unit. This unit does not have any RMP regulated substance and thus is not included as a prevention program. \n\n\n\n - Process Boundary and Maximum Inventory Verification: The site performed a reverification of the process boundary and maximum inventories. The overall total processes were increased from 1 to 8. This is based on the EPA's definition of interconnec"

In addition, some of the previously denoted individual regulated substance quantities have been reduced to zero. This was due to the reclassification of process chemicals as a flammable mixture instead of reporting the components individually. The previous quantities are now represented in the Flammable Mixture #2. \n\n\n\n - Removal of Regulated Substances: Isoprene was removed from the plan as it has been verified to be below 1% in the chemical mixture pervious denoted as the by-product HAD (Heavy Aromatic Distillates). \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n - The Sabine River Operations site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the LEPC and City of Orange Fire Department which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n - The Dow Chemical Company Sabine River Operations site operates under multiple air permits. There is insufficient room in the registration section to list this information, so we are providing the information on the additional air permits over the covered processes: 1895, 2331, 2055, 1899, and 1882.\n\nSRO has eight (8) processes, twelve (12) programs and fifteen (15) regulated substances present at the stationary source.

For Flammable Mix #1, the worst-case models were based on the composition of the system as this material is a standard by-product from the Ethylene Unit. For the alternative cases, butane, with the highest heat of combustion was assumed to be 100% of the mixture. For Flammable Mix #2, no specific composition was used.

For initial screening a Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA).
