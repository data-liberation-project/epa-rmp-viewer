The employee training program includes a general awareness of the hazards and emergency response plan related to chlorine.  Employees that work with the processes receive more specific training related to maintenance, inspections, operation, and safety of the processes.  Awareness and emergency action information is provided to contractors working on or near the chlorine processes.\n\nThe mechanical integrity program involves periodic inspections of the chlorine process equipment and operations.  The emergency action plan covers the chlorine processes and is organized to mitigate potential releases and protect the safety of employees and the public.  \n\nThe combination of training, frequent inspections, and an established emergency action plan has resulted in a system that operates in a safe and efficient manner.  In addition, the plant adheres to the OSHA Process Safety Management program, which adds additional safety and awareness to the chlorine process.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\nThe Mitchell Plant is a coal-fired electric utility operated by American Electric Power and located near Moundsville, West Virginia.  The plant operates under a Title V operating permit issue by the WVDEP.  A chlorine system is utilized at the facility in the circulating water system.  The chlorine system at the facility is the only process utilizing a regulated chemical above an RMP threshold quantity.  \n\nTo prevent an accidental release of chlorine, the plant uses a safety system that incorporates employee training, system reviews and inspections, as well as a facility wide emergency response plan.  This system has produced a process that operates in a safe and efficient manner with no accidents over the past five years.  Evaluation of potential safety improvement is an ongoing process and safety improvements are made as necessary.\n\nThe plan addresses the procedures to be used in the event of an accidental spill.  The plant has a HAZWOP plan and is a member of the Northern Ohio River Industrial Mutual Aid Council and the Marshall County LEPC.  Employees are provided annual refresher training that reviews emergency action plans, spill prevention and response, as well as emergency contacts.  Employees who work with the chlorine systems are provided more in depth training.  Any changes to the system will be investigated through a Process Hazard Analysis prior to being made to ensure the changes do not impact the safety of the system.\n\nThe plan will be managed by the Chief Chemist and Plant Environmental Coordinator and is overseen by the Plant Manager.  The plan will be periodically reviewed to ensure all sections are current.\n\nHazop Study was done and review was done May 23, 2007, major issue was rearranging into a more user friendly format in progress, this revision was completed March 16,2008"
