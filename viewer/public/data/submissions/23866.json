The RMP program is required by 40CFR Part 68, ?Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(9).?\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nIt is the policy of Jacintoport International, L.P. to minimize releases of anhydrous ammonia to the area surrounding the facility, and to minimize the hazardous consequences of a release, should one occur, through implementation of and strict adherence to a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and a Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThe PSM and RMP programs are administered through active, regular employee participation in all requirements and aspects of the programs.  Contractors and other organizations that may work on the ammonia refrigeration system are also required to know and understand the requirements of the PSM and RMP programs at Jacintoport International, L.P.\n\nJacintoport International, L.P. also has a policy to work closely with local emergency response organizations, specifically the Channelview Fire Dept., to coordinate all actions in the event of an unwanted release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe PSM and RMP programs must undergo frequent, periodic review by all employees and contractor personnel, and all employees and contractor personnel must demonstrate recurrent training in process operations and maintenance.  Personnel are also encouraged to recommend system changes and operational changes that will improve overall process safety an"

The area surrounding Jacintoport International, L.P. consists solely of industrial operations and facilities.\n\nThe process covered by the PSM and RMP programs is the Ammonia Refrigeration System installed in the facility.  It is the sole process covered by the PSM and RMP programs at the facility.\n\nThe hazardous chemical covered by the PSM and RMP programs is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS No. 7664-41-7.  The inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the plant is 32,000 lb.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only hazardous chemical in the facility beyond the threshold amount of 10,000 lb.  The process is covered under the requirement of Program Level 3.\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Toxic Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios involve the release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The release scenarios are for Toxics.  No flammables release scenarios are required.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis results are based on the EPA?s Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables and Equations.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system at Jacintoport International, L.P., is a catastrophic release of ammonia liquid from the Main Refrigerant Receiver, installed in the refrigeration system machine (or engine) room.\n\nThe scenario is a spill of refrigerant (gas liquefied by refrigeration) and vaporization of the liquid.\n\nFrom the Guidance Tables and Equations the following were determined:\n\n    Quantity Released:                13,680 lbs\n    Release Rate:                    191.5 lb/min\n    Release Duration:                10 min.\n    Wind Speed:                    1.5 m/sec\n    Atmospheric Stability:                F\n    Topog"

There are no environmental receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nPassive mitigation of the release is provided by the enclosed refrigeration machine room.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario for the release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system at Jacintoport International, L.P., is a catastrophic release of ammonia liquid (pipe leak) from the main refrigerant liquid supply piping installed on the roof of the warehouse facility.\n\nThe scenario is a spill of refrigerant (gas liquefied by refrigeration) and vaporization of the liquid refrigerant.\n\nFrom the Guidance Tables and Equations the following were determined:\n\n    Quantity Released:                4,536 lbs\n    Release Rate:                    8,342 lb/min*\n    Release Duration:                10 min.\n    Wind Speed:                    3.0 m/sec\n    Atmospheric Stability:                D\n    Topography:                    Urban\n    Distance to Endpoint:                0.50 mi*\n\n*Release rate determined from Eq. 3, Chapter 4 of the Guidance, based on a 3? hole in the pipe.

There are no environmental receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nNo passive mitigation was considered for the alternative release scenario.  Active mitigation is provided by emergency shut-down of the intermediate-temperature accumulator which shuts down the refrigerant pump supplying liquid to the piping when the level drops below approximately 8 to 10% of full level.

Note, however, that the alternative release scenarios is considered without shutting down the pumps (if a level switch failed).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention:\n\nThe chemical-specific release prevention program consists of all of the elements of the Process Safety Management program at Jacintoport International, L.P.  The PSM program includes strict adherence to the Standard Operating Procedures, employee and contractor personnel training and qualification records, maintenance of mechanical integrity, pre-startup safety review procedures, and management of change procedures.\nIn addition, the design of the system includes ammonia detectors in the various areas of the warehouse, and safety interlocks that shut down portions of the system.\n\nThe prevention program also includes using standard operating and maintenance procedures in accordance with IIAR and ASHRAE recognized practices for ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Jacintoport International, L.P. facility has not experienced an unwanted or reportable release of ammonia during the past five (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe emergency response program at Jacintoport International, L.P. consists of notification of local emergency response organizations if a release of more than 100 lbs of ammonia occurs.  Employees will not handle releases of 100 lbs of ammonia or larger.\n\nMinor leaks, etc. are handled by the standard operating procedures detailed in the PSM.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPlanned changes include:\n\n1.  Move the under floor heating air supply to an outside source to prevent ammonia discharge.\n\n2.  Add information signs to the facility\n\n3.  Tag all operating valves in the system\n\n4.  Provide check list and logging forms\n\nAll of the changes are to be completed by December 31, 2001."
