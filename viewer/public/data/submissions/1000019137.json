All refinery process units are currently managed under the PSM Standard; therefore, these process units are currently managed as RMP Program Level 3 processes.  The refinery has a thoroughly-trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record.  The refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nValero has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and contain the release.\n\nTo comply with the RMP standard we have focused upon the following:\n\nMaintaining the management system established by PSM\nAdapting the PSM management system to address RMP\nPerforming the hazard assessments\nCompiling the data elements\nCommunicating with the public concerning RMP issues\n\nPublic Communication of RMP \n\nPremcor (Williams Refining at the time) assumed a leadership role in organizing a community wide-RMP Symposium that took place April 13, 1999, at the Agricenter International."

Twelve area companies, numerous federal, state, and local regulatory and emergency response agencies participated in the symposium.  Each company or agency prepared a booth with informational literature and displays.  Persons ready and willing to discuss RMP, safety programs, or answer public questions staffed the booths.  Expert speakers, emergency response equipment, and live demonstrations of Shelter-in-Place and HAZMAT response were also featured.  Approximately 600 people attended the symposium.\n\nThe refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which meets monthly, to identify effective means for communicating RMP/Safety information to our immediate neighboring community.  CAP members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to distribute our RMP-related printed material at various venues in the community.  Valero and the CAP members agree that RMP/Safety communication should be an ongoing effort.\n\nHazard Assessment Results - Identification of Scenarios\n\nRelease scenario results were estimated using the RMPlanner software published by JBF Associates.  The software calculates estimated distances to the endpoint based on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \"Lookup\" Tables.  Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is the only covered toxic that is present in the refinery in a threshold quantity.  The largest inventory of RMP flammables is in the LPG spheres.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nValero has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  No incident has resulted in offsite effects (deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage) as defined by EPA's RMP guidelines (RMP-covered process and RMP-covered chemicals).

RMP-regulated processes at the refinery are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary will address each of the OSHA PSM elements.\n\nThe Health, Safety, and Environment (HS&E) Department oversees compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119, the PSM standard.  The department has developed a management system for satisfying the requirements of each of the 14 elements that comprise the PSM standard.  Where appropriate, a time frame is specified for completion of the necessary action.  The program is audited periodically to evaluate its effectiveness.  The management system is intended to accomplish the following:\n\n* Describe the requirements of each paragraph of 1910.119\n* Describe how each requirement will be satisfied\n* Establish responsibilities for compliance action\n* Ensure that all compliance actions are documented\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe HS&E Department leads the overall PSM effort.  Each refinery department is responsible for ensuring employee participation within the department.  The management system policy for each PSM element identifies responsibilities that are more specific.\n\n*The refinery PSM program was developed with the direct participation and involvement of employees from all levels and departments in the refinery.\n\n*Teams assembled for pre-startup safety reviews, HAZOPs, and incident investigations are composed of employees representing a broad spectrum of disciplines and experiences.\n\n*The Joint Health and Safety Committee meets monthly to address all safety concerns that employees have that have not been addressed after w"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator (writer-trainer) to learn process-specific duties and tasks. Operators may work independently only after showing (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform job duties and tasks in a safe manner.\n\nThe training program addresses:\n* Initial training - for new employees\n* OSHA-mandated training - for all employees, covering topics such as hazard communication, process chemistry, refinery technology, emergency response, etc. \n* Progression training - for all employees moving up in job classification\n* Refresher training - for all employees, covering new equipment and processes, and keeping knowledge and expertise up-to-date.\n\nEmployee training is an ongoing effort covering a variety of subjects.  Depending upon the subject, training may be preformed one-on-one, in a classroom setting, or using the computer-based training modules.  All training is documented and credi"

The Program is intended to maintain a plant-wide, consistent level of safe work performance. The HS&E Department is responsible for enforcing the Contractor Safety Program.  Such enforcement involves not only the contractor's responsibilities, but also Premcor's obligations under paragraph (h) of the PSM standard.  This program has resulted in the contractors at this site going 2524 days (as of 9/22/06) without a lost time accident.  The Contractor Safety Program includes the following:\n\n* Requires contract bidders to provide information on accident rates and the contractor's safety programs.\n* Requires the contractor to verify each employee's knowledge of job safety, craft skills, and equipment operation before assignment to onsite work.\n* Restricts bid requests to those contractors who have satisfied minimum requirements.  Those requirements include reviewing of their OSHA 300 log, a documented drug screening program, comprehensive \"Safety Action Plan,\" and English fluency for employees performing safety-sensitive work.  Contractors supply information on ISNETWORLD and receive a rating which is used to determine if they can become an approved contractor.

The review is intended to verify and document that all aspects of the equipment's design, construction and operation have been evaluated, and to certify that the equipment can be placed in operation. The PSSR team uses checklists and field verification of construction to examine all aspects of readiness.  The PSSR is the final step in the construction or installation of new or modified equipment before the equipment is placed in service.
