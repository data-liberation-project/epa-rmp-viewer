AES Cayuga LLC has evaluated each recommendation in a timely manner and has implemented those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nAES Cayuga LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based process rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\nAES Cayuga LLC believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Operators and Maintenance personnel, will be deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they will assume a major responsibility for operating the ammonia process safely.\nThe AES Cayuga LLC Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Lansing Volunteer Fire Department.  All AES Cayuga LLC employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAES Cayuga LLC operates a Fossil Fuel Power Generating Station.  Ammonia is used to control Nox emissions in their stack gas.   Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in amounts above the threshold quantity.\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst case scenario and alternative case scenario data can be viewed onsite by request.\n  \nIV.
