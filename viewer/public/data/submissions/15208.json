      "SummaryText": "by a computerized tracking system. \n\n\nHazard Identification\n\n\nChlorine exists as a gas at standard pressure and temperature conditions. Chlorine gas is 2.5 times as dense as air, and thus, is likely to form clouds at the ground surface. Although classified as a nonflammable gas, chlorine may cause fire on contact with combustible materials as a result of the heat released when highly reactive chlorine combines with those materials. Chlorine forms hydrochloric acid upon contact with water and becomes extremely corrosive (therefore water must never be used in the presence of a chlorine leak).  The primary health hazards consist of effects on the respiratory system of hydrochloric acid, including severe irritation and possible severe injury of eyes, throat, and lungs.  Formation of HCl not only causes respiratory damage but corrodes the opening of the leak, causing the leak to increase in volume.   Inhalation of chlorine gas may also result in death from suffocation.   MSDS sheets for chlorine are located in the chlorine building, and in the plant office (master MSDS book).  \n\n\nA significant liquid chlorine release, slug release, at the CAWD WasteWater Treatment Facility could occur as a result, and only as a result,  of extensive damage to a chlorine cylinder. This could occur as a result of an accident during maintenance activities in the vicinity of the storage rooms, as a result of operator error during handling, or as a result of an external event such as an earthquake. The likelihood of a significant rupture is not probable as indicated by the lack of such occurrences within the industrial community. Nevertheless, for the purposes of further evaluation, the liquid release scenario is the rupture or damage to one or more of the four chlorine cylinders resulting in the release of the entire liquid contents of X number of cylinders - (X x 2000 lbs/cylinder). In the case of a puncture in the liquid phase of the cylinder, liquid will be expelled through the hole until"

Upon the activation of the chlorine leak detector, the automatic dialer pages the on-call operator who in turn calls a preset number for the dialer and is in turn informed, by synthesized voice communications with the computer, that a chlorine leak has been detected.\nThe ventilation system servicing the chlorine storage room is also wired to the chlorine leak detector which allows for securing the ventilation system in the event of a leak. An emergency override switch has been provided for local control of the emergency ventilation system. This allows for controlled evacuation of the storage room at timed intervals. Inwardly opening ventilation louvers installed in the chlorine storage room remain shut until a negative pressure is exerted on the room by the emergency exhaust fan. These measures serve to create containment for atmospheric chlorine in the event of a release.\nA wind sock has been installed on the roof of the chlorine storage building to assist emergency response teams in determining prevailing wind direction.\nEmergency breathing apparatus have been located just outside the chlorine storage room so as to facilitate near immediate entry procedures if needed.\n\nCondition of Chlorine Storage, Distribution, and Injection System Equipment:\n\nThe chlorine storage, distribution, & injection system as it exists today, was primarily built and/or installed during the 1985 expansion project and either meets or exceeds building standards for equipment of this nature.

This section presents a summary of the risk reduction measures that have been incorporated into the facility design and into the facility's standard operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nSystem Mitigation Measures:\n\n\nThe particular causes of accidental AHM release include operator error, equipment failure, and uncontrollable external events such as natural disasters. The ultimate goal in this particular circumstance is to encourage that staff adopt an acute awareness of unsafe operating practices where AHM's are concerned. Operator error could result from several causes including not following proper procedures or inadequate training.  All operations personnel have received training on the proper use of the chlorine cylinder repair kit.  This training is performed annually by the chlorine manufacturer/supplier.  Each employee demonstrates his or her skill with the B kit and receives a certificate of competency for chlorine cylinder repair.  All 6 regular Operators and the Chief Operator are authorized to take necessary steps to shut the chlorine system down in an emergency.  Additionally, the Monterey County Emergency Response Team, including the California Department of Forestry, has conducted emergency response training at the CAWD WasteWater Treatment Facility in preparation for an accidental release of chlorine. CAWD staff members were involved as support personnel.\nExtensive written procedures for Receiving Cylinders, have been developed and are to be followed at all times:\nThese procedures are performed by teams of 3 employees, all wearing SCBA equipment, who run down the procedures in a checklist form, much like an airline crew.\n\n\nEquipment Failure:\n\nA comprehensive maintenance program is critical to limiting the number of occurrences of equipment failure.

CAWD staff personnel assist the technicians when applicable so as to facilitate in-house maintenance when necessary. In between scheduled maintenance routines, the AHM equipment is inspected daily to ascertain levels of equipment integrity. All other non-electronic equipment AHM equipment such as valving and piping, is maintained as per manufacturers specifications. Additionally, equipment such as the chlorine leak detector is tested on no less than a monthly basis to insure equipment functionality.  \n\n\n\nExternal Events:\n\nExternal events such as earthquakes or flooding represent a special problem for facilities of this type as it is impossible to predict their frequency or magnitude. No amount of engineering will prevent the release of an AHM if an earthquake measured at 9.5 occurs. As is noted in previous sections, much thought has gone into designing the chlorine storage room so as to abridge the likelihood of a release of an AHM  in a semi-managable catastrophe. To avoid compounding the problem, no flammable material is stored in the chlorine storage room which is constructed solely of concrete and steel. This measure eliminates the possibility of a fire rupturing the chlorine cylinders. Furthermore, the cylinders themselves are designed to execute a controlled release of chlorine, rather than a cylinder explosion, in the event of a fire.  If cylinders are engulfed in flames, chlorine leakage is certain, and water shall not be used for firefighting.  SCBA and full protective gear shall be used by firefighters.\n\nThis facility has been subjected to two major floods during the past 5 years, each of which represents a worst case hundred year flood event.

The evaporation rate of the spilled liquid depends on heat input from the ground and from the sun. It should be noted that at standard conditions, the weight of one volume of liquid chlorine equals the weight of 456.5 volumes of chlorine gas. The boiling point of liquid chlorine at one atmospheric unit of pressure is -33.97 :C (-29.15 :F). \n\n\nA significant gaseous chlorine release could occur in the portions of the chlorine storage and supply systems where chlorine exists in the gaseous state under pressure. In the case of a puncture or leak in the upper (vapor) phase of the cylinder or the cylinder supply pigtail to the chlorine header, about one-fourth of the liquid (depending upon liquid temperature) remaining in the cylinder will rapidly flash off. This will cool the remaining liquid to the atmospheric boiling point. The evaporation rate of the remaining liquid primarily depends on the heat input from the atmosphere. It is very possible that the atmospheric temperature surrounding the leak will drop low enough to freeze atmospheric moisture around the leak effectively sealing the leak. In the case of a chlorine vapor leak from the chlorine supply header, the installed vacuum/pressure sensor will immediately shut, isolating the leak.As a means of reducing risk associated with the use of acutely hazardous materials (AHM's) at the Carmel Area WasteWater District's Treatment Facility, the Carmel Area WasteWater District has implemented a number of measures as part of the design of the chlorine system and as part of the facility's standard operating and maintenance procedures.

      "SummaryText": "Two 1' isolation valves,\nOne chlorine leak detector (set to alarm at 1p.p.m. atmospheric chlorine),\nTwo exhaust fans (normal),\nOne exhaust fan (emergency).\n\nThe chlorine distribution system consists of the following:\n\nTwo 2 vacuum ejectors,\nOne 1 vacuum ejector,\nThree 500 lb/day chlorinators,\n4 chlorine distribution lines,\nEffluent disinfection,\nRAS injection,\nEffluent pump station emergency injection, &\nPlant influent injection (CAWD/PBCSD Manhole, Influent manhole, & Headworks manhole).\n\nThe chlorine injection system consists of several chlorine solution injectors located at:\n\nChlorine contact tank influent piping,\nEffluent pump station wet well,\nRAS wet well,\nCAWD/PBCSD trunk manhole,\nInfluent manhole, &\nHeadworks manhole.\n\nChlorine System:\n\nChlorine gas is drawn from two of the four chlorine cylinders attached to the header. As each tank is drawn empty, the automatic switchover vacuum regulator aligns the next full cylinder with the header. If loss of vacuum occurs at any point downstream of the switchover valve, the regulator automatically isolates the chlorine cylinders and header from the distribution system. Items #1 through #10 listed under Section B, chlorine storage system,  are shown on this detailed drawing. \n\nChlorine distribution system as contained within the chlorination/dechlorination structure: Plant effluent pumped through the chlorine ejectors induces a vacuum which draws the chlorine from the chlorine header. Chlorine gas is mixed with the effluent creating a 15 to 20 mg/l chlorine solution which is piped to the various points of injection.\n\n\nChlorine System Safety Features:\n\nThe chlorine system has been designed with specific features to safeguard against the accidental release of chlorine gas or liquid. These features include:\n\nAll chlorine cylinders stored at the chlorine building are held securely in high impact resistant trunions, which are set in concrete, and are held securely to the trunions by high tensile strength webbed belts and"

The possibility of accidental cylinder relocation during a natural disaster or an operational evolution is infinitesimally small.\nChlorine cylinders fusible plug - Each one ton chlorine cylinder is fitted with a fusible plug which will melt at extreme temperatures to prevent the rupture of the cylinder in the event of a local fire.\nOne ton cylinder leak repair kit - The CAWD currently maintains two Type B chlorine cylinder repair kit for use in repairing on-site chlorine cylinder leaks.  Employees receive yearly training in the use of this kit.\nFlexible connectors (Pigtails) - Each one ton chlorine cylinder is attached to the chlorine header via flexible metallic tubing specifically designed for this purpose. The connections on either end of the tubing are sealed with fiber gaskets to prevent leakage at the joint.  Pigtails are replaced yearly, before corrosion degrades their performance.\nPressure/Vacuum gauges are located throughout the chlorine storage, distribution, and injection systems to allow for the monitoring of system integrity and proper operation. \nAn automatic switchover/vacuum regulator shuts to isolate the chlorine cylinders and header from the chlorine distribution system should a loss of vacuum in the distribution system occur.\nPressure reducing valves are installed in the chlorine header to ensure that chlorine supply pressure is maintained within the manufacturers specifications.\nEach of the three 500 lb/day chlorinators used to regulate the chlorine supply is equipped with a vacuum regulator which permits chlorine gas flow only when adequate vacuum (supplied by the ejectors) is present.
