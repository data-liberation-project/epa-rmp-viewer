      "SummaryText": "The City of Chattanooga runs and operates thr mbwwtp in Chattanooga, Tn. The plant uses chlorine which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance, for disinfection. Liquid chlorine flows into the bottom of the hot water bath vaporizer and is converted to gaseous chlorine through a series of pipes and a chlorinator. The vaccum draws the gaseous chl;orine into water passing through the injector. The chlorine gas the gors into solution and is piped to chlorine contact diffusers, where it is mixed with clarified effuent from secondary clarifiers before rnterinth the chlorine contact tanks. In these tanks, the chlorine solution is mixed with the clarified effuent to achieve adequate disinfection. \n\nTwo release scenarios were modeled using the Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmospheres(ALOHA) computer program developed by the National Safety Council for emergency planning and training. The worse case scenario (i.e., catastrophic failture of a 2000-pound tank over a 10-minute period due to corrosion, impact, or construction defect, a windspeed of 1.5 meters per swecond, and an atmospheric stability class of f) resulted in a toxic endpoint of 2.6 miles. Approximately 33,630 people in Marion and Hamilton counties are estimated to reside in the 2.6 mile radius surrounding thr facility. The alternate-case scenario (i.e., a release of liquid chlorine from a horizontal cylindrical 1-ton container through a short pipe or valve in the bottom of the tank, resulting in a two-phase release, a windspeed of 2.24 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of c) resulted in a toxic endpoint of 1.2 mile radius surrounding the facility.\n\nThe plant is subject to federal requirements, including the prepration of PSM and RMP programs(29CFR1910.119 and 40CFR Part 68). Additionally MBWWTP is subject to and in comliance with OSHA rules. MBWWTP has (1) in-house procedure for the safe operation of the chlorination process; (2) a training program for workers (including contractors a"
