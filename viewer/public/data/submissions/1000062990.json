      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) prepared for the Price Raptor Dew-Point Plant (Price Raptor) specifies the procedures for complying with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, and contains the  requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of a catastrophic release of flammable liquids at this facility. This plan is intended to be used in conjunction with Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, LLC's Process Safety Management/Risk Management Standard Practice and the Price Raptor Dew-Point Plant Operating Procedures.  The plan contains the required hazard assessments, five-year accident history, release prevention program elements, emergency response program, management system to oversee implementation of the program, and personnel assignments responsible for developing, implementing and integrating the program elements.\r\n\r\nPrice Raptor is located in an urban area in Carbon County, Utah, near Price, Utah.  The gas processing plant can process up to 140 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCF/D) delivered from interstate pipelines.   To reduce the hydrocarbon dew point of the gas, the facility uses a refrigeration system to chill the gas. \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system uses propane as a refrigerant in a closed-loop cycle and the refrigerant is recycled within the system.  By chilling the process gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) condense and collect in a separator.  The processed gas stream (now known as residue gas) exits the top of the separators and leaves the facility.  \r\n\r\nNGL produced in the process trains are then processed to meet industry standard specifications.  An NGL stabilizer removes the lighter hydrocarbon components (mostly methane gas) from the liquid NGL.  Any separated methane fraction is recompressed via an overhead compressor, and re-introduced to the pipeline system.  Stabilized NGL are stored short term onsite in seven, 30,000 gallon pressurized storage"

Administrative controls on the NGL tanks limit the storage of NGL to 27,000-gallons per tank.  \r\n\r\nTo prevent formation of hydrates during either of the chilling processes, ethylene glycol (EG) is injected into the process stream at various locations. Rich EG (EG containing water) is collected within the separation equipment. Rich EG is transferred to an EG reboiler where water is driven off. EG is then recycled by re-injection into the process.  Heat is required in the NGL stabilizers, provided by circulating hot oil (Therminol 59) through the NGL reboiler. This oil is heated in a skid mounted fired heater located some distance from other process skids, circulated via pumps within a closed loop system and is continuously recycled.\r\n\r\nNGL is a flammable mixture subject to the RMP rule as it is primarily comprised of a mixture of propane, ethane, butane and pentane, with a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Flammability Rating 4 [will rapidly or completely vaporize at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, or is readily dispersed in air and will burn readily (e.g., propane, butane) and flash point below 23\u00b0C (73\u00b0F)].  The threshold quantity for regulated flammable substances is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of NGLs at Price Raptor is 189,000 gallons or 776,790 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals or products, as based on an average NGL density of 4.11 pounds per gallon, in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold quantities for flammable substances.\r\n\r\nPropane (used as a refrigerant) is stored in four, 2000 gallon pressurized tanks. As described above, propane is a flammable liquid subject to the RMP rule, with an NFPA Flammability Rating 4. The maximum inventory of propane at Price Raptor is 8000 gallons or 32,880 pounds, as based on the density of propane of 4.11 pounds per gallon, which is in excess of the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity for a flammable substance, and therefore sub"
