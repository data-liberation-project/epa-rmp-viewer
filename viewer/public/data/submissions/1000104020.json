Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. These personnel receive specialized on the job training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Delta Baytown to manage changes in chemicals being packaged, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators and maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a change or modification of process conditions are made aware of the changes. \n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in existing processes are conducted as needed. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation. \n\nCompliance Audits\nDelta Baytown conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out annually and any corrective actions as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly. \n\nIncident Investigation\nDelta Baytown promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring. Reports are retained in the web based CMS system.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDelta Baytown believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the incident prevention process.

      "SummaryText": "IOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nDelta Baytown is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Delta Baytown is a Program 3 level facility.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp; program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp; is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the regulated chemicals involves the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel containing the regulated substance at the facility and is either a rail car (est. 20,600 gallons) or a tanker truck (est. 6,000 gallons), depending on the regulated chemical, but for conservatism all worst-case scenarios assume catastrophic failure of a rail car.   \n\nThe alternative release scenarios include:\nA 3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 90A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \nA 3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 70A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \nA 3 hose separation flange at 90A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \nA four drums falling off the loading dock and contents leaking within one minute at 100A\u00b0F.  \nA overfilling of a drum at the filler for 1 minute at 90A\u00b0F.  \n\nNone of these scenarios are likely to result in the full amount of the regulated substances being released because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst-case and alternative scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\n\n1.5\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nDelta Baytown has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release preve"

This commitment is inherent to the accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes.  It is Delta Baytown's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances.  Delta Baytown has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response. \n\n1.3\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Delta Baytown facility's primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta Baytown receives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars, and iso tanks and transfers them to 55-gallon drums, 320 gallon and 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers.  Filled containers are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite.  Typical Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are provided for all predicted regulated substances in Appendix A.   \n\nChemical\tCAS No.\n\nToxic Substances:\t\nCyclohexylamine\t108-91-8\nEthylenediamine\t107-15-3\nPiperidine\t110-89-4\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate\t584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate\t91-08-7\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\t108-05-4\n\nFlammable Substances:\t\nDimethylamine\t124-40-3\nEthylamine\t75-04-7\nEthyl Mercaptan\t75-08-1\nMethylamine\t74-89-5\nIsopropylamine\t75-31-0\nTrimethylamine\t75-50-3\n\n\n1.4\tTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENAR"
