The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Gilcrest Gas Plant is coordinated with Gilcrest / Platteville Fire Protection District.  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.
