      "SummaryText": "The Cairo Cooperative Equity Exchange\n\nPrepared By: Aaron Murphy\n\n\n\n1.The Facility Policy\n\nOur employees will do what is possible with their training to stop the release, but will not be emergency\n\nresponders. The Pratt fire department will be the emergency responders and the Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee will be used for major evacuation.\n\n\n\n2.Facility Information\n\nThe NH3 facility is located west of the man office. Preston receives storage and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nto farmers as agricultural nutrients.\n\n\n\n3. The Worse Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorse case scenario would release 50,000 pounds in a 10 minute period or 5,000 pounds per minute with\n\na 0.79 mile to end point. Alternative release could involved a transfer hose rupture this would result in a\n\nrelease of 11,908 pounds in a 2 minute period with a 0.56 mile to end point.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe Cairo Cooperative Equity Exchange recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by State\n\nand Federal Agencies and has annual training for the employees. The most common accidental release would\n\nbe overfilling of nurse trailers: An example would be a nurse trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air\n\ntemperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Cairo\n\nCooperative Policy is not to fill above 85%.\n\n\n\n5. Fire Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cairo Cooperative Equity Exchange has an Emergency Action Plan and a Safety Director. All areas have\n\nworked with the county, city, and insurance company's loss control department for the development of these\n\nplans.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Safety Changes\n\nThe company Safety Director and Operations Manager tour the branch once per month. All areas are toured\n\nonce a quarter. Changes are made on an as needed basis as new regulations or concerns arise.\n\n"
