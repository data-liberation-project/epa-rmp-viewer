The refinery was acquired by Shell on August 11, 1995 from St. Rose Refining, Inc., a subsidiary of Enjet, Inc.  Process units at the St. Rose Refinery include a crude distillation column, vacuum flasher, steam boiler, storage tanks, a wastewater treatment plant, and various support facilities.  The refinery operates under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 2911:  Petroleum Refining, and North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 32411:  Petroleum refineries.   The facility is in the process of converting to an asphalt production facility which should be operational by December 2012.\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery maintains detailed health, safety, and environmental (HSE) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facility.  As part of this commitment, Shell invests resources in various areas of accident prevention such as:\n\n- Safety in process design;\n\n- Safe operating policies and procedures;\n\n- A comprehensive mechanical integrity program;\n\n- Management of process changes;\n\n- Training;\n\n- Incident investigation and auditing; and\n\n- Emergency response.\n\n \n\nThis summary provides an overview of the risk management activities at the St. Rose Refinery, including:\n\n- A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule;\n\n- A summary of potential release scenarios and potential off-site consequences;\n\n- An overview of the Accident Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases;\n\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n- An overview of the emergency response program; and\n\n- Existing and planned improvements to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTI"

      "SummaryText": "ON AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe refinery is currently implementing a facility-wide operational change to produce bitumen products, which are a key ingredient in asphalt.  These operational changes will allow the facility to accept higher sulfur content crude streams, which will impact the facility's applicability status with respect to the requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part 68.  The refinery's wastewater treatment system will collect wastewater with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentrations potentially in excess of 1% by weight.  It is unknown at this time whether actual H2S concentrations in the wastewater will exceed the 1% RMP threshold; however, in order to ensure compliance with RMP requirements, the facility has elected to register as an RMP-covered facility until actual concentration data can be obtained to verify concentrations are below the threshold.  No other process at the refinery is subject to RMP requirements and H2S is not thought to have the potential to accumulate in concentrations greater than 1% in any other location at the refinery.  Several of the refinery's product sour streams will contain H2S; however, based on the material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and refinery personnel process knowledge, these concentrations should remain below the 1% threshold. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving toxic mixtures at the facility.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions nor allow credit for all mitigations in-place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigations.  \n\nThe following are brief summaries of the WCS and ARS at the facility, including information on mitigation control measures to reduce potential offsite impacts.  All OCA release modeling was p"

Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census Landview&reg; VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).\n\n\n\n1. Toxic Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe \"process\" containing the largest volume of H2S is the wastewater surge tank (TK-8554), which has a maximum storage capacity of 12,000 barrels of water.  The wastewater surge tank is located at latitude 29.95238?N and longitude 90.32835?W.  The surge tank will only reach maximum capacity in a heavy rainfall event and, in this case, the H2S concentration of the wastewater would be significantly lower than in normal operations.  Therefore, as a worst-case scenario, the surge tank is projected to contain 10,000 barrels (420,000 gallons) of wastewater with a conservative H2S concentration of 2% by weight.  Assuming a density of 8.34 pounds per gallon (lbs/gal) of water, the total quantity of H2S gas in the surge tank is calculated to be 70,056 lbs.  The catastrophic failure (worst-case scenario) of TK-8554 results in a toxic endpoint distance of 12.0 miles (19.3 kilometers).\n\nThis worst-case scenario would have wide-ranging offsite impacts with an estimated impacted population of 332,544 people.  The toxic plume has the potential to cover 452.4 square miles and affect over 140,000 residences.  There are multiple hospitals and schools in the neighboring area that could be impacted by this release.  The potential impact area includes several recreation areas, including Lafreniere Park, Delta Park, Ama Park, and Lions Playground.  Depending on the wind direction at the time of the release, potentially impacted cities could include the vast majority of Kenner, Metairie, and western portions of New Orleans, Louisiana, if the wind is from the west at the time of the release.  Impacted areas if winds were from the east at the time of release would include the cities of Nor"

Toxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA probable alternative H2S release scenario is an overflow of the wastewater surge tank due to an extreme rainfall event, such as a hurricane.  Since the majority of the water entering the surge tank would be rainwater, the H2S concentration would be diluted; thus, a concentration of 1% by weight H2S is assumed for modeling purposes.  This scenario could result in an estimated 1,000 barrels of water to overflow releasing approximately 3,500 lbs of H2S gas over a period of 30 minutes (116.67 lbs per minute) before shutdown procedures could be initiated.  The endpoint distance calculated as a result of this release is 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers).  Approximately 1,094 people and 355 residences could be impacted in the event of this release, which covers an area of 0.8 square miles.

All safety related PHA findings are risk ranked to ensure mitigation measures receive timely attention based on their risk priority.  All PHA findings are forwarded to local Management for review and resolution.  Safety related mitigations approved by Management begin immediately after Management review, starting with the highest risk scenarios.   When a final mitigation cannot be implemented within a reasonable time (e.g. hardware change scheduled to a unit maintenance turnaround), interim solutions such as administrative controls (i.e. operating and work practice changes) must be implemented to mitigate the risk.  PHA mitigations are tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  Process unit PHA's are revalidated every 5 years for the life of the process.  Written PHA reports are also retained for the life of the process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery operating departments maintain written procedures to address a variety of operating modes such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide a reference to experience operators, as well as serve as a training tool for new operators.
