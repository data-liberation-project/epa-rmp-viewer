KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nKNC\u00bfs Taft Terminal handles receives and stores anhydrous ammonia, which is primarily used as a fertilizer.  The anhydrous ammonia is received by ship and stored at the facility until it is either (a) loaded on to a ship or barge or (b) injected into a third-party pipeline for further transport and distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance stored at the Taft Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility (1,250 gallons); however, it is used strictly as a fuel and is therefore exempt from RMP reporting pursuant to 68.126.  The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00bfOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u00bfOperatin"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having continuous pilots.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a backup flare in the unlikely event that the main flare went out.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by installing a wind-proof flare tip that will withstand winds up to 130 mph.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system and the flare system by having a backup power generator.\n\u00bfEmergency shutdown buttons at the barge and ship loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the ship/barge crew in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00bfSurge bladders on the ship/barge loading lines to absorb the shock during sudden closure of the valve due to emergency shutdown.\n\u00bfA fire water deluge system on top of the largest ammonia tanks.\n\u00bfAmmonia sensors in the process areas and on the property to detect ammonia and activate the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition monitoring system if the threshold"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the St. Charles Parish Hospital Ambulance Service, the Louisiana State Police, and the U.S. Coast Guard.  The Taft Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
