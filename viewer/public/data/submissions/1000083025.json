In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 11511, \"support activities for crop production\". Our facility engages in the receiving, storage, and relaoding of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only with little of the product transfers taking place. The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary. Maximum quantity handled at a given time will be the unloading of a rail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\n\n\n\nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected day and night during use, and all through out the \"off season.\"\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" Additionaly we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including but not limited to: excess flow valves, breakaway cou"
