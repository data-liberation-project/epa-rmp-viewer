The Company ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n \r\nThe Company also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n \r\nSummit Midstream has conducted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes at the Hereford Gas Plant are identified and controlled. Within the PHA, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Company primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The HAZOP methodology utilizes a systematic nodal approach to assess potential process deviations and associated risks.\r\n \r\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it believes such measures are necessary.

This ranking is measured against the Summit Midstream risk matrix to ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention. \r\n \r\nOperating Procedures\r\n \r\nSummit Midstream maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures shall be annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures will be kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n \r\nThe operating procedures are used to communicate safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) pipe break procedures for hazard mitigation before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n \r\nTraining\r\n \r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Summit Midstream has developed a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n \r\nContractors\r\n \r\nSummit Midstream may use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Company has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Additionally, gas plant personnel will periodically evaluate the performance of contract employers in complying with plant safety policies and procedures.\r\n \r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n \r\nSummit Midstream conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
