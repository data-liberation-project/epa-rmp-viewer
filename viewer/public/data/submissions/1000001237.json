The June 13, 2013 incident is still under investigation; all information contained in this 5-Year Incident Report is preliminary.  This includes the initiating event, the contributing causes, and the quantity of chemicals released.  The 5-Year Incident Report input fields (drop down menu) have limited options and no opportunity to provide further explanation.  In order to provide a more complete response, Williams has preliminary concluded that the incident was caused by:\n\n \n\n- the unexpected presence of liquid hydrocarbons in the reboiler in standby mode;\n\n \n\n- the introduction of heat into this standby reboiler; and\n\n \n\n- the pressure relief system was isolated from the reboiler which was in standby mode.\n\n \n\nNitric Oxide (\"NO\") is an RMP chemical; NOx is a product of combustion produced from combustion of  released flammable materials.  Available factors were used to estimate the amount of NOx produced.  NO is a component of NOx.\n\n \n\nIf necessary, Williams will update the 5-Year report after the investigation is completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Williams Olefins, Geismar Ethylene Plant has a long-standing commitment to protect employees, the community and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety and environmental consequences in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Geismar E"

The Geismar Ethylene Plant is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant has regulated flammable substances including, propane, 1,3-butadiene, propylene, ethylene and ethane.  Additionally, the plant uses chlorine, which is also a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Every incident is investigated very carefully to determine ways to prevent the incident or similar incidents from recurring.\n\n\n\nApproximately 60 pounds of a flammable mixture was released in 2009 due to a mechanical failure.  The resulting fire caused property damage.  The equipment was re-designed following this incident and the written operating procedures were revised.  No injuries or off-site impacts resulted from this accident.\n\n\n\nLess than 1 pounds of a flammable mixture was released in 2012 when improper procedures were followed on a furnace.  The resulting explosion caused property damage. The flammable mixture was consumed during the explosion. New process controls are being added, operating procedures are being revised, and additional training will be conducted as a result of this accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release/Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs Steps\n\n\n\nAn accident prevention program is in place at the Geismar Ethylene Plant.  Because the process at the Geismar Ethylene Plant is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the elements of these programs are listed below. Collectively, these prevention program activities help minimize potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equip"

The MTSA is a federal law designed to protect U.S. ports and waterways from a terrorist attack.  It requires measures to control access to facilities and vessels that might be vulnerable to an incident resulting in a significant loss of life, environmental damage, transportation system disruption, or economic disruption. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant maintains a written emergency control program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Geismar Ethylene Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency control program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Geismar Ethylene Plant processes or other Geismar Ethylene Plant facilities. \n\n\n\nThe overal"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committees, which include local emergency state officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Geismar Ethylene Plant has communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., sheriff's office, Geismar Area Mutual Aid, complex emergency brigade, etc.).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Geismar \n\nEthylene Plant conducts periodic emergency drills. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant is committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.

These recommendations are currently being implemented where appropriate."
