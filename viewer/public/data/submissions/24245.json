Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations that have command support and visibility.  The APG follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.  This document meets the update requirements for the Aberdeen Proving Ground to develop a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act as Amended 1990 (CAAA-90).  It describes elements of the program, assigns responsibility and tasks for implementation, and communicates clearly APG's commitment to its workers and surrounding community that the risk of catastrophic releases of chlorine are minimized.\n\n\nFacility Background:\n\nThe APG is located approximately 30 miles north of Baltimore, Maryland and 50 miles south of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland.  44,000 of those acres are either wetlands, or under water, including portions of the Bush and Gunpowder River and the Chesapeake Bay.  The APG comprises two areas, the Aberdeen Proving Ground Aberdeen Area (APG-AA) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area (APG-EA), which are 15 miles apart by land.  The APG is home to more than fifty tenants and numerous satellite activities.  Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Developmental Test Command (DTC), U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School (OC&S), U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), U.S. Army Solider and Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM), U.S. Army Environmental Center (AEC), U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine (USACHPPM), U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD), and major elements of U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL).  The combined military and civilian work force exceeds 15,000.  The quantity of chlorine stored and used at APG's water treatment plan"

      "SummaryText": "t (WTP) and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) requires APG to develop and implement a Risk Management Program.  Chlorine is the only chemical that currently exceeds threshold for applicable risk management regulations at APG.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s):\n\nA worst-case release analysis has been performed for both treatment plants using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) required parameters.  Results of this analysis indicate that the area of concern, or footprint, from a worst-case release would potentially impact a 3 mile radius around the APG-EA WWTP and a 1.3 mile radius around the Van Bibber WTP.  A release at the APG-EA WWTP has the potential to impact the largest population.  The area of concern for the worst-case release from the APG-EA WWTP would include a population of 9,511 people.  The worst-case of concern for the Van Bibber WTP would affect 7,107 people around the plant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nIn addition to the RMP, APG has a Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  APG's PSMP addresses safety in the workplace by identifying related work processes and assuring all safety measures required are followed.   The ICP describes additional procedures and regulations followed by various APG offices in preparation for response to a hazardous materials incident.  The ICP is included in this document by reference.  The following is a list of specific standards followed:\n\n29 CFR 1910.120    Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\n29 CFR 1910.38    Employee Emergency and Fire Protection Plans\n\n40 CFR 110    Discharge of Oil\n40 CFR 116    Hazardous Substances, Designation of\n40 CFR 117    Hazardous Substances, Reportable Quantities\n40 CFR 300    National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan\n\nPL 92-500    Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended\n\nNFPA 471    Recommended Practice for Responding to Hazardous Mater"

In addition, DSHE-FESD is a member of the local community response network with mutual aid agreements in place to assist or be assisted by other fire departments, including the Harford county Hazardous Material Emergency Response Unit.  The APG DSHE-FESD consists of two fire stations with 61 full time emergency responder positions.  Emergency response personnel participate in addressing major regulations (such as the RMP) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.  Policy for the DSHE-FESD is defined by Army Regulation (AR)420-90 which adopts the National Fire Protection Association codes for operation. "
