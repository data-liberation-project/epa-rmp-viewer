Nevertheless, an emergency such as release of Epichlorohydrin is possible.  McIntyre's emergency response procedure will help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, and contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nMcIntyre has implemented programs and procedure that comply with EPA's Level 3 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.\n1. Worst-case release scenario for Epichlorohydrin can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor.\n\nThe accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n1. Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment.\n2. Conduct periodic hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substance, processes, and procedure.\n3. Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances.\n4. Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs.\n5. Monitor and control maintena"
