      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\nIt is the policy of the Continental Deli Foods (Continental Deli) Concordia, Missouri facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Continental Deli employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\nContinental Deli management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nFacility Description\nContinental Deli Foods produces cooked and packaged ham for sale through distributors.  Continental Deli occupies approximately 62,000 square feet with offices on the west side of the building, a maintenance shop on the northeast corner, and an unloading dock on the south side.  The facility is bordered by St. Louis Street and management parking to the west, an open field to the east, COMPEDCO to the north, and an automotive shop to the south.  Figure 1-1 shows the site location and Figure 1-2 shows the facility layout.\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is aff"

The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B '68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Concordia, Missouri facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\nAmmonia\nThe data provided in the document \"Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPA's \"RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\" (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid; the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the high pressure receiver in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 8,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 800 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the"

      "SummaryText": "worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the high pressure receiver is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 1.06 miles (1.71 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.  Figure 1-3 details the worst-case release zone.\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia system is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a condenser unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 57.6 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 57.6 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 41.3 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, and 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of Continental Deli operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 41.3 lbs/min, the duration for a 500-pound release is 12 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.06 mile (96.5 meters) from the release point.  \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Preve"

Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system.  Continental Deli employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nContinental Deli policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Continental Deli maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nContinental Deli is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.
