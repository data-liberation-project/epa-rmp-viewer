This program is organized into the following elements : 1)Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program wherever possible; 2) Training is provided for operators and maintenance personnel; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on ammonia hazards and the refrigeration system; 4) A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the refrigeration system was conducted and will be periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the system continues to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide operators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the system; 7) Contractors working on or near the refrigeration system are selected for safety performance, and are briefed on the hazards and safety requirements of the job; 8) Hot Work Permits are required whenever welding, cutting, grinding or other activities are conducted that could generate sparks and start a fire; 9) The Management of Change (MOC) program requires that the impact of changes to the refrigeration system be evaluated and approved prior to the work being conducted; 10) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted prior to restart of the system after modifications to ensure that impacts of the change are addressed; 11) Incident investigations are conducted for incidents involving ammonia releases and near misses that endanger employees or the public; 12) Compliance Audits will be conducted every three years to ensure that the prevention program is meeting its objectives; 13) Emergency Planning and Response ensures that employees and emergency personnel are prepared to respond to an ammonia release in accordance with the plant's emergency plan and that notifications are made to designated points of contact at local, state and federal levels depending on the extent of the release.",

All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nMiddleport Cold Storage, based in Middleport, NY refrigerates and stores fruit. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Middleport Cold Storage has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n3.Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Middleport Cold Storage facility.\n\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Middleport facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n5.Five Year Accident"

Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMiddleport Cold Storage expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the process hazard analysis are designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Middleport Cold Storage expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
