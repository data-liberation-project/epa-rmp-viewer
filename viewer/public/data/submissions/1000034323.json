Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed refrigeration equipment at the facility, which is common in the industry. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the refrigerant is removed and placed in a storage vessel at the end of each season.  The storage vessel is secluded from traffic and has a water sprinkler system to reduce temperature & pressure during very hot days in the Yuma area.   The system was constructed per the applicable codes at time of construction circa 2001.  Appropriate fire and life safety measures were engineered into the Plant, including an ammonia sensor and independently monitored alarm system.\r\n   \r\nInterconnecting piping and other associated equipment between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Additionally some vessels and the Cold Room evaporators are permanently mounted.  Portable refrigeration equipment is owned by or is leased in partnership with Western Precooling Systems.  Detailed information about stationary and portable refrigeration equipment is depicted on Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams, International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, Facility Diagrams and other Process Safety Information within the RMP Program.\r\n\r\n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe RMP Prevention Program is very similar to OSHA's PSM Program.

This correction is intended to more accurately reflect the policies & procedures of ACS, LLC and update the facility name, which is now ACS, LLC - Site #2, without re-setting the 5-year RMP update timeline.        \r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe ACS, LLC - Site #2 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  It is a primary goal of ACS, LLC to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations.  The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program which is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  The PSM program is a coordinated effort with ACS's refrigeration partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).

Entrance to the facility is monitored and limited.  Fencing, gates and retention basins around the facility perimeter help prevent un-authorized entry.\r\n\r\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualified incidents.

The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.  The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production workers, supervisors, managers, and operators.  The facility emergency plan (FERP) is reviewed and appropriate updates submitted annually to the AZ State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Yuma County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City of Yuma Fire Department.

This is an annual event that promotes safety, training and a stronger working relationship between Regulatory Agencies, the local Ammonia Refrigeration Industry and the Public.     \r\n\r\nUnder ACS's Emergency Response policy, ACS employees who have been trained as First Responder-Awareness may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  ACS will evacuate the affected area, begin notification process, and rely on qualified responders (e.g., the fire department, portable ammonia equipment supplier and/or refrigeration contractor).\r\n\r\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety are achieved through the continued implementation of the Plant's RMP/PSM Program.  The primary mechanisms used to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to): Compliance Audits, Process Hazard Analyses (PHA), and Mechanical Integrity inspections and maintenance, including IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections by qualified personnel.

Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a PHA, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by ACS's Management of Change Procedure.  If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, ACS has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, an ACS Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.  (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review).\r\n7. Verification of ACS's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and RMP) has been implemented and properly documented by ACS personnel.
