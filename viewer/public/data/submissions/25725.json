Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Oregon Freeze Dry are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement apropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are coordinated with the Albany Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Cource and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 82,593 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp program provided by the EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\nThe first Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Oregon Freeze Dry's Plant 1.  The scenario involves the release of 3,999 lb. Of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid and gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 400, and a distance to endpoint of 1.1miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 3,750 within this distance.\n\nThe second Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Oregon Freeze Dry's Plant 2.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interva"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We will continue our annual plant evacuation and emergency response drills.  In addition, a joint anhydrous ammonia emergency response training drill was conducted with National Frozen Foods Corporation and the Albany Fire Department on December 13, 2001.  This drill enhanced our mutual aid capabilities in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at our facility."

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergnecy shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading up to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP Rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, Oregon Freeze Dry hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed.  Oregon Freeze Dry has the strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.  5-Year Accident History"
