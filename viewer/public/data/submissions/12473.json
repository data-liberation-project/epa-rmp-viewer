Chlorine is the only chemical used that meets the EPA's RMP reporting requirements.\n\nChlorine is stored (a maximum of eight tons) in the Chlorine building, an area designated for the express use of the Chlorination Process.  Chlorine is used for disinfecting the plant's effluent flow (which is then de-chlorinated by the use of Sodium BiSulfite), for aiding in the settling of solids, for control of Filamentous Bacteria and for odor control.  \n\nThe Chlorine is purchased from reputable suppliers who are trained and competent in the safe handling and preparation of the chemical.  Storage locations are set up for each individual ton cylinder, with floor mounted blocks that prevent accidental cylinder movement.  A 3-ton overhead traveling crane is used to move the cylinders into position for use.  A ton cylinder is placed on a floor mounted roller trunnion in order to be placed in service.  The injection system is operated totally in a vacuum from the point of attachment at the ton cylinder to the point of injection into the water.  Vacuum must be realized by a two stage safety valve attached to the ton cylinder before the valve will open, allowing Chlorine to be passed into the system.  From that point, the Chlorine must travel under vacuum only about ten feet before being injected into a high velocity water flow.  After mixing with water, the Chlorine is no longer considered a hazardous chemical to the public.  \n\nAccidental releases other than from the cyulinder itself are remediated by shutting off the cylinder's service valve.  Service valves are only opened 1/4 to 1/2 turn, so the attached valve wrench can shut off flow with a single movement.  \n\nAny damage to the Ton Cylinder is handled with a B Emergency Repair Kit.  Plant employees are trained annually on Chlorine safe handling and ton cylinder emergency measures.  A Ton Cylinder Emergency Rep"
