The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of two interconnected storage tanks of chlorine (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, a distance of some miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a pipe leak on the ammonia storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 500 lb. of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class d atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.1 mile.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for bromine involves a release from a pipe leak at the bromine storage area in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 750 lb. of bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 11.3 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of bromine is 1.0 mile.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a pipe leak at the chlorine unloading area in the Bromine Refinin"

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass refining bromine from a feed brine stream.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses. Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for bromine recovery and scaveging.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of bromine at our facility is 3,000,000 lb. while chlorine, ammonia and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are present at our facility in quantities of 412,208 lb., 189,306 lb. and 147,084 lb. respectively.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables"
