Camp & Sons potato shed near Famoso, California.  The chlorination system incorporates many inherently safe design features.  These features include fail safe (vacuum open and spring close) flow valves in the vacuum feed regulator and ejector that fail in the closed position.  \n\nThe equipment handling chlorine at the D.M. Camp and Sons Potato Shed was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, codes, and ordinances in effect at the time of construction.  As such, the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nWhile it is D.M. Camp & Sons\u00bf objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the potato shed facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the D.M. Camp & Sons Potato Shed facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nD.M. Camp & Sons has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and CalARP regulations.  At least every three years, D.M. Camp & Sons audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nD.M. Camp & Sons owns and operates a potato shed located at 31999 Famoso Road.  Famoso is the closest population center to the rural D.M. Camp & Sons potato packing shed.  The rural facility is located between Highway 99 and the Southern Pacific railroad spur.  \n\nIn D.M. Camp & Sons chlorination system, chlorine is drawn from ton containers through vacuum feed regulators by a vacuum created by ejectors installed on the process water line.  Rotameters are ins"

This arrangement chlorinates the process water only when there is water flow through the ejectors. During normal operation, two one ton containers are connected to the process water chlorination system.  The maximum quantity in a one ton container is 2000 pounds of chlorine.  \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for chlorine as 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm).  This concentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by D. M. Camp & Sons to address the chlorination system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00bf Written operating procedures will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\n\n\u00bf If employees are involved in operating the chlorination system, they will receive initial training and refresher"

M. Camp & Sons. has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Potato Shed Manager.  The Potato Shed Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe D. M. Camp & Sons Potato Shed facility has not had any accidental releases from chlorination system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nD. M. Camp & Sons has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since D. M. Camp & Sons Potato Shed employees will not respond to accidental releases"

Camp & Sons does not have any changes planned to improve safety associated with the chlorination system."
