      "SummaryText": "This section reflects updated information that has been developed subsequent to the June 1999 and 2004 Risk Management Plans for this facility.  The purpose of acknowledging these changes is to provide a more accurate Risk Management Plan for use by the City of Lewisville for the five-year renewal commencing June 21, 2009, and for the following five-year period.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) under Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and subsequently finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This rule established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP. 40 CFR Part 68 is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances. In compliance with the Risk Management Program requirements, Lewisville submitted Risk Management Plans (RMP\u00c2\u00bfs) to USEPA in June 1999 and in 2004 for its water and wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nThe regulations require that these RMPs be resubmitted within five years following the initial submission of the plans.  In addition, while the resubmission is to reflect a general update of all sections of the risk management plans, specific elements of each plan, the Offsite Consequence Analysis and the Hazard Assessment, must be redeveloped prior to resubmission of the plans. Additionally, the regulations require that if any facilities are modified through improvements that change equipment, controls, or amount of chemical in use onsite, the risk management plans must be updated to reflect the changes. Effective April 9, 2004, the U.S. EPA issued Changes to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) in 2004; these changes were incorporated into the 2004 Risk Management Plan update for the Prairie Creek"

The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Lewisville Fire Department in case of an emergency. The plant staff will receive training to enable an on-site staff response prior to the arrival of either the City of Irving HAZMAT Team or the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team.  The City of Irving HAZMAT Team will respond to a major release while the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team will respond to a minor release.\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP uses chlori"

Both chemicals are in quantities that exceed the threshold limit set by the USEPA.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP is located at 897 Treatment Plant Road in Lewisville, Texas.  The wastewater is treated at the plant, disinfected by chlorine and dechlorinated by using sulfur dioxide, and subsequently discharged.  \nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the Prairie Creek WWTP consists of a storage facility, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves drip lines and filters to each, three manual feed chlorinators, and gas piping and ejectors.  Chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release in the chlorine storage area. The majority of the chlorine feed process operates through a water injection induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing potential pressurized leaks along the feed lines.  \n\nThe existing sulfur dioxide feed facility at the Prairie Creek WWTP consists of a storage facility, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves drip lines and filters to each, three flow proportionate feed sulfunators, and gas piping and ejectors.  Sulfur dioxide has a potential to generate a gaseous release is the sulfur dioxide storage area.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and process areas have associated hazards that can potentially affect onsite employees and the offsite population and environment.  The USEPA requires that a single worst-case release scenario for the facility and one alternative release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nA worst case release scenario was developed for this update.

Prairie Creek WWTP management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Prairie Creek WWTP was reviewed for a period from June 2004 through June 2009.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide had occurred.  \n\nPolicies were developed by the City of Lewisville that will cause a resubmission of the RMP within six months of the occurrence of a reportable chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe City of Lewisville has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  Back-up personnel are available in the event that the primary response personnel cannot be contacted. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide emergency, (2) information about frequency of employee emergency response training, and (3) a detailed description of the emergency response training underway. Emergency responders and equipment will be provided by either the City of Irving HAZMAT Team or the City of Lewisville HAZMAT Team; the HAZMAT Team will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant.\nPolicies were developed by the City of Lewisville that will cause a correction submission for the RMP for any emergency contact information changes within 30 days of t"
