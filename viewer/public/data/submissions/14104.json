The management and employees of Effingham Clay Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. 2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140,000 pounds. 3. The worst - case scenario and the alternative release scenario. The worst- case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tankas limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 miles. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. 4. The accidental release prevention program. This facility complies with EPA's Accidental release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirementsfor the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American Narional Standards Institute, Inc.as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". 5.
