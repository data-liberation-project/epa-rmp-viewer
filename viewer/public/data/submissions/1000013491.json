The owner, management, and employees of Hutchinson Co-op/Lester Prairie Site, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia if and accidental relaease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n    A. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\n    B.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored,and distributed for application on crops as fertilizer nutrients.\n\n    C.  The maximum quantity stored would be 79,560 pounds in an 18,000 gallon storage tank.*Note: Maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n    A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,560 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n    B.  The alternative release scenario is baased ona release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.59 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release, prevention program\n\n     A.  The facility has implemented the provisions of the safety requirement for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1, Published by the american national standards institute inc.\n\n     B.  The facility has implemented the standards fo the US occupational safety and health administration (OSAH) 29 CFR 1910.111, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5.
