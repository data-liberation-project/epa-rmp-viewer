Figure 2 shows the Facility relative to the WCRS maximum distance area depicted by a circle with a radius of 0.51 miles centered on the Facility.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The EPA document Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used to determine the consequences of an Alternative Case Release Scenario (ACRS) for the Facility.  The ACRS was selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  The ACRS represents a release that: 1) might occur at the Facility; and/or 2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  The ACRS is the rupture of a truck loading/transport hose between the truck and the propane loading pumps.  This scenario assumes that the regulated flammable substance (propane) is released from the ruptured hose for 30 minutes until Facility personnel detect the release and isolate the ruptured section.  The released propane forms a vapor cloud, resulting in an explosion.  This ACRS was reviewed and a new analysis performed as part of the update to this RMP.  The ACRS analysis should be reviewed at least once every five years, or sooner if changes in the regulated processes or stored quantities occur.  The maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure was determined to be 0.26 miles from the Facility.  Based on measurements taken from the Facility and surrounding area, and a visual survey of the adjacent properties within a 0.26-mile radius of the facility, the population within the ACRS area is estimated to be zero (0).

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  The accidental release prevention release policy employed by EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  This approach includes training programs for personnel; programs to guarantee safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Dragon Trail Gas Processing Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Dragon Trail Gas Processing Plant.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are typically followed.  The emergency response policy of EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and comply with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The goal of the spill policy of EnCana Gathering Services (USA)Inc. is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and that will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at the Facility is the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from a natural gas stream.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  There are several flammable regulated chemicals typically stored at the Facility.  The flammable regulated chemicals are generally present in mixtures and include methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and condensate (an aliphatic hydrocarbon mixture containing several flamm"

Figure 2 shows the Facility relative to the ACRS maximum distance area depicted by a circle with a radius of 0.26 miles centered on the Facility.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.180.  This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source. \n\nProcess Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis:  EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. maintains a written Emergency Response Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the Facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained in the RMP at the Facility. \n\nFive-year Accident History:  No release of a regulated substance occurred at the Dragon Trail Gas Processing Plant in the five years before June 21 1999, the effective date of the Risk Management Planning regulation.  No release of a regulated substance has occurred at the Facility since the implementation of the Risk Management Program. \n\nEmergency Response Program:  The Facility has an Emergency Response Program outlined in the Dragon Trail Gas Processing Plant Emergency Response Plan.

The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance. In the event of a NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure, as well as procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the appropriate local authorities.  A site map is included in the Emergency Response Plan.  This Emergency Response Plan is kept at the Facility separately and should be referenced in the event of a release.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes at the Facility and the covered process and the employees are informed of changes.\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  EnCana is committed to operating the Dragon Trail Gas Processing Plant in a safe manner with regards to personnel, the public, and the environment.  Maintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures and incident investigations will be continually used to identify changes to improve safety.

The regulated flammable chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The Facility handles and stores the flammable substances listed above in sufficient quantities to exceed this threshold quantity.  The Facility stores up to 77,820 gallons of natural gas condensate and refined liquids, and approximately 241,000 gallons of propane in above ground storage tanks and vessels.  The largest storage vessel contains a maximum of approximately 248,760 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  The RMP*COMPTM program developed by the CAMEO team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency was applied for the worst case release scenario (WCRS).  The worst-case release scenario analysis was reviewed and a new analysis performed as part of the update to this RMP.  The worst-case scenario analysis should be reviewed at least once every five years, or sooner if changes in the regulated processes or stored quantities occur.  The worst-case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 60,000-gallon propane storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which then detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is an overpressure condition of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions.  Using the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.51 miles from the Facility.
