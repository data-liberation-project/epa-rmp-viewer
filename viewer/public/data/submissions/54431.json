This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nBama Foods, LTD. maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Bama Foods, LTD. facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 9\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 180-200 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration proce"

The total ammonia inventory is 42,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Bama Foods, LTD. to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the Bama Foods, LTD. employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monit"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection.  The facility will notify the Maintenance Manager in the event of a release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility?s accident history in the last five years (February 2004 - February 2009) revealed that Bama Foods, LTD. has had one release involving ammonia, the regulated substance.  The amount of ammonia released from the system was less than the reportable quantity of 100 pounds.  The facility conducted an incident investigation of the release, which occurred on December 6, 2006.  The investigation showed that the evaporator coil of AU-24 had corroded, resulting in a pinhole leak.  An employee was sent to the hospital for ammonia inhalation.  Mitigation measures that resulted from the investigation consisted of the replacement of the evaporator coil and the inclusion of corrosion monitoring in the Mechanical Integrity section of the PSM program.  These changes were completed on March 12, 2007.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBama Foods, LTD. has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBama Foods, LTD. has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was completed in January 19 - 20, 2009 and a PHA Revalidation was completed in February 22, 2005. Recommendations were generated during the 2009 Compliance Audit to improve safety at the facility.  These include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues.
