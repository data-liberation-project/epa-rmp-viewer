A&AT LLC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Waynesboro facility is operated by A&AT LLC effective January 1, 2018 to produce Lycra(Trademark Registered) and Hyfit(Trademark Registered) brand spandex.  The branded spandex is made in a plant that was put into service in the early 1960s and is referred to as the Classic plant. The Classic facility is located near the center of the plant. It consists of three basic areas: polymer processing, spinning and recovery. The site also has the Benger R&D facility and a Chemistry lab. Both of these facilities have the primary responsibility of support for spandex operations.\r\n\r\nThe site also has its own Powerhouse and utility support. The Powerhouse has two <99MMBtu boilers, which burn natural gas, but can use small amounts of #2 fuel oil. Three coal boilers were permanently shutdown in 2014.\r\n\r\nIn the spandex facilities polymer processing uses an aromatic diisocyanate (Diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI) combined with glycol in a heated reactor to form the base polyurethane polymer, or"

The diluted capped glycol solution is transferred to a second reactor where various reagents are added to determine the properties of the polymer, such as chain length.\r\n\r\nEthylenediamine (1,2-Ethanediamine) is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Waynesboro facility in amounts above threshold quantity. This chemical is used as an additive in the spandex polymer process. The facility is regulated under the Program Level 1 requirements.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by A&AT LLC. These high standards include:\r\n\r\nOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\nOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\nOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\nCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Waynesboro facility is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\nA tank and delivery containment system that will easily accommodate a complete release of Ethylenediamine from both tanks if they we"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Virginia State Police, the Waynesboro police and fire department and Augusta Medical Center. The City of Waynesboro Fire Chief has the authority to assume Incident Command (IC) of any emergency scene or incident within the boundaries of the City of Waynesboro. In his absence, the Department on duty shift Commander will serve in his capacity. The A&AT LLC Emergency Services Team Leader shall act as the A&AT LLC Incident Commander. The A&AT LLC Plant Manager or his designate has overall responsibility for Site personnel, buildings, and equipment. A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.
