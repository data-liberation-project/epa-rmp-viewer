              "Description": "The Westbrook Energy Center burns natural gas in two gas turbines which are connected to generators that create electricity.  The exhaust heat from the turbines is sent through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) where its thermal energy is used to heat water and create steam.  The steam can then be utilized in a steam turbine which is also attached to a generator thereby increasing the ouput of electricity.  This type of plant set-up (known as \"combined cycle\") is extremely efficient and very common.  The 29.5% aqueous ammonia solution is used to reduce toxic emissions from exhuast gasses.  The gas exiting the gas turbines contains oxides of nitrogen.  These nitrogen oxides are almost entirely removed throughselective catalyst reduction (SCR) using ammonia.  The ammonia is drawn from a tank located outside of the power plant via transfer pumps to the ammonia skid.  There, it is diluted with flue gasses and heated in a vaporizer and injected into the gas stream, then into the catalyst bed.  It is in the catalyst bed that the ammonia reacts with nitrogen oxides forming nitrogen and water.  These harmless substances are then exhausted into the atmosphere via the plant stack.  An automatic control and monitoring system regulates the vapor flow.  The entire ammonia storage, vaporization, and injection cycle is relatively simple when compared to other ammonia systems.  It was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards and is operated per standard industry practices.",

      "SummaryText": "The Westbrook Energy Center located in Westbrook, Maine generates electric power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine.  As part of its emissions control it injects diluted ammonia vapor into the turbine exhaust and thus reduces NOx emissions.  The ammonia is stored in a 29.5% aqueous solution in a 20,000 gallon vertical tank.  The ammonia is piped in liquid form to a vaporizer where it is diluted with air and heated to gas.  This gas is injected into the turbine exhuast gases in the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used in an enclosed system as a heat reduction source to cool ambient air as the air flows into the turbine that is attached to a generator generating electricity.  This type of process is extremely efficient and commonly used.  Anhydrous Grade Ammonia serves as the most economically abundant and efficient heat transfer medium for industry refrigeration and heat reduction processes.\n\nThe facility has strictly implemented preventative maintenance procedures and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The release of ammonia is specifically covered in the ERP and contains all emergency contact numbers as well as employee safety and mitigation procedures.  As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted annually for all employees on Hazardous Materials Handling, Hazard Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operation, maintenance and emergency procedures.  There is a specific procedure for delivery and handling of ammonia, which includes specific operational guidelines as well as emergency actions.\n\nThe Westbrook Energy Center has had no ammonia related accidents or releases.\n\nFor Aqueous Ammonia, the facility modeled two off-site consequence analysis.  The first was a worst case scenario that consisted of a full release of the aqueous ammonia storage tank instantaneously.  The second analysis was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a delivery hose rupture.  \n\nFor Anhydro"

The second analysis was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a rupture disk/relief valve failure.  \n\nThe Westbrook Energy Center has completed and is actively implementing a Risk Management Plan.  The facility is in full compliance with all provisions of the RMP and with OSHA's PSM Standard.  The Facility has submitted a VPP Application and is scheduled for a VPP Audit in late October 2009."
