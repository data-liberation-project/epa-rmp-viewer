      "SummaryText": "   The Lumberton Municipal Utility District owns and operates this sanitary sewer wastewater treatment plant. The facility was built in 1995. The District is currently enlarging the plants treatment capacity. All of the latest safety concerns will be incorporated in the new construction design. This facility uses chlorine to disinfect the effluent. There is never over 6,000 pounds of chlorine on the facility at any given time. The District has implemented many safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine release. Additionally, the plants location is rather remote. Most accidental releases would not be a threat to the populace.                                                                                                                                                                Our personnel are, and will continue to be trained in emergency procedures. The Lumberton Fire Department would respond in the event they are needed. Installed at our plant are both audible and visual warning devices to alert our employees of any chlorine release problem. We are very proud of the fact there has never been a reportable chlorine leak at this facility. We believe, because of our dedication to safety awareness, operating and handling procedures, the possibility of a problem chlorine release is at it's minimum."
