Staff, support all the activities and proper actions required in order to comply with the regulations established by the Local Environmental Quality Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation and the Local Fire Department.  Our prevention program was develop mostly with information gathered from the different Chlorine Institute pamphlets and from our suppliers of Chlorine (Jones Chemical) , and Caustic Soda (PPG).  Our emergency response plan includes the participation of the Plant operators, the Engineer in Charge, the Fire Department (4 differente cities) and the Local Civil Defense Office.  All safety, health, prevention and emergency information is available to the public in the Fire Department, Civil Defense Office and the Local Health Department.\nWe consider that the most important element related to the accident prevention program and the emergency response plan, is the people knowledge of the , product - process - equipment (operational & safety), involved in this operation.  We expect to accomplish this thru continuous training and practice.\n\nII - The sodium hypochlorite manufacturing facility at our site, started in July 1997.  Our product is registered and regulated by the EPA and the Agricultural Dept. as a pesticide.  Recently was certified by the National Standard Foundation for drinking water disinfection and can be used also for waste water disifection.  \nThe location is outside-north (Road # 185) the urban zone of the city of Juncos, PR.  The manufacturing process combine the use of tanks, pumps, pipelines, valves, heat exchangers, chiller and process control devices.  Raw materials used are: Caustic Soda 50% liquid, Chlorine (liquified gas) in 2000 lbs. containers.  We store some 150 lbs. chlorine containers for resale.  Chlorine is a toxic g"

The process of manufacturing sodium hypochlorite is by the injection of chlorine to diluted caustic soda, at the required level.  We store aproximately 50 tons containers and 22, 150 lbs. cylinders.  There is a chlorine alarm detector and the proper safety equipment available in the plant.  Plant operators are well trained in the use of both, process and safety equipment.\n\nIII - We used the RMP*Comp version 1.06 to determine the distance endpoint for both, Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  The WCS assumes the complete failure of the largest vessel at the facility, in this case a 2,000 pounds cylinder, in 10 minutes.  The release rate of 200 pounds per min. with no mitigation measures in a rural zone was used.  Estimated distance to endpoint is 3.0 miles for toxic level of 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2).  Other assumptions were : wind  speed of 1.5 meters/sec., stability class - F and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The estimated residencial population to toxic endpoint obtained was 24,700, using the 1990 US Census.  Public receptors includes, schools, residences, hospitals, correctionals facilities, recreation, commercial, office and industrial areas.\n\nIII - The ARS assumes a break in a 1/2 in. pipeline.  Release duration of 10 sec., for a flow rate of 30 pounds/min. with no mitigation measures in a rural zone was used.  Estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.8 miles for 0.0087 mg/L (ERPG-2).  Other assumptions were : wind speed of 3 meters/sec., stability class D and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The estimated residencial population to toxic endpoint obtained was 1,100 using the 1990 US Census.

We review it every year and include trainings on the use of SCBA and Chlorine Institute Emergency Kits A and B.  We perform drills with our own operators.  We will conduct a drill every year in coordination with the local agencies starting in June 1999.\n\nVII - Only one major change has been implemented in the procedure since the start up of the operation.
