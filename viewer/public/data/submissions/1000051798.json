This equation applies to choked flow or maximum gas flow rate.  Choked flow generally would be expected for gases under pressure.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, a pipe containing a flammable gas is broken.  The release rate was estimated from the simplified equation.

(PAPCO) owns and operates a natural gas liquids recovery facility, the Warren Fractionation Plant, in Clarendon Pennsylvania.  The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, and refrigeration.  Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas.  The plant handles and stores process flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane, and heavier components.  Some of the flammables are in excess of the threshold quantities.  PAPCO management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids.  Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  The Warren Plant has no recordable accidents in the past five years.   \r\n\r\nPAPCO has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident.  A radius of impact has been calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software.  Global Positioning System (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within the impacted area.
