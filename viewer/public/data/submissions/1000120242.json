The building for the indoor storage of chlorine gas is fire resistant, has multiple exits with outward opening doors, and is adequately ventilated with a scrubber system to control the release of chlorine to the atmosphere in the event of a release. The building is also outfitted with a chlorine leak detection system and alarms to alert CUC staff when a leak occurs inside the building. Both empty and full cylinders are secured in the storage area. The building meets the applicable building safety codes adopted by the CNMI. Fire protection for the building includes automatic fire detection and alarm systems and an automatic sprinkler system. The assigned storage space is for 128 full chlorine gas cylinders and 48 empty chlorine gas cylinders.\nChlorine is a listed regulated substance under both RMP and PSM. Chlorine in its gaseous state has a greenish-yellow color and has a pungent irritating odor similar to bleach. Chlorine is neither explosive nor flammable, but as a strong oxidant supports combustion. Chlorine gas can react violently with greases, turpentine, ammonia, hydrocarbons, metal filing"

Dry chlorine gas will not corrode steel or other metals but is extremely corrosive to most metals in the presence of moisture. The compression of chlorine gas creates chlorine liquid. Liquid chlorine changes easily to a gas at room temperatures and pressures.\nThe maximum number of full (150-lb) chlorine cylinders to be stored in the proposed facility is 128, resulting in a maximum total quantity of 19,200 lbs of chlorine in the storage process. Because this amount of chlorine in the storage process exceeds the RMP threshold of 2,500 lbs, the chlorine storage building will be subject to USEPA\u0092s RMP and because this amount also exceeds the OSHA threshold of 1,500 lbs, the process will also be subject to PSM. Chlorine cylinders become part of the regulated process once they are delivered to the storage building by the distributor and received by CUC staff. Neither the transport from storage to the chlorination sites nor the chlorination sites themselves will be subject to PSM or RMP. This is because no more than 10 cylinders of chlorine would be transported at a time and each chlorination site stores less than 1500 lbs. of chlorine at any time.\nAs discussed below the RMP regulation identifies three separate sets of requirements for processes classified as Program 1, Program 2, or Program 3. A newly regulated process qualifies for Program 1 if its worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) would not affect off-site public receptors. For a Program 1 process, the owner/operator is required only to submit a simple RMP to USEPA and notify local emergency response agencies. In this case, Program 1 is not an option because public receptors are located very close to the storage building. All processes that do not qualify for Program 1 need to develop either a Program 2 or a Program 3 Risk Management Program, each of which is comprised o"

The consequences of these releases are determined by using mathematical models to estimate the distance to toxic or flammable endpoints specified in the regulation. A circle centered at the modeled release with a radius equal to the endpoint distance is drawn on a map satellite photograph and the types of public receptors that are located within that circle are determined and reported in the RMP.\nFor chlorine gas stored as a liquid at ambient temperature under its own vapor pressure, the worst-case is prescribed as release of the entire contents of a single cylinder (150-lb) in ten minutes. The worst-case release can account for passive mitigation factors (such as an enclosure) that may reduce the rate that the gas is released to the atmosphere. The worst-case release may not however account for active measures (those that require energy, mechanical action or human intervention). In addition, the worst-case release is assumed to be released at ground level into a weakly dispersive atmosphere, defined according to an atmospheric stability category of F (very stable) and a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec (nearly calm).\nFor the alternative release scenario, realistic release rates and typical dispersion conditions can be applied. Discussions that take place during the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) are considered in defining the alternative release. The alternative release scenario may account for both passive and active mitigation. According to USEPA guidance, an atmospheric stability category of D (neutral) and wind speed of 3 m/sec may be considered to characterize typical dispersive co"

If the PHA does not identify that such a release is likely, a more conservative release rate (such as used for the worst-case release) may need to be considered.\nBased on the conceptual design, the worst-case release was considered to be an accident inside the chlorine storage building releasing the entire contents of a 150-lb chlorine cylinder over 10 minutes, resulting in a release rate of 15 lb/min. The worst-case release of chlorine was modeled with EPA\u0092s RMP*CompTM computer program to estimate the distance to the Toxic Endpoint of 0.0087 g/m3 (3 ppm). In RMP*CompTM the surface roughness is specified as either urban or rural. In accordance with the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.22(e)), because the storage facility is surrounded by industrial and commercial buildings, the urban surface roughness was selected. The resultant RMP*CompTM Toxic Endpoint distance is 0.5 km (0.3 mi). The circle encompassing the estimated worst-case endpoint distance is illustrated in Figure 2. The types of public receptors in this circle include a public dock and commercial and industrial enterprises. It appears that one or more residences may also be located in the southeast portion of this area.\nPotential release scenarios were discussed during the initial PHA conducted on March 21, 2025, Chamorro Standard Time and is included as Appendix B.25. The possibility of the worst-case release (150 lbs. over 10 minutes) was considered to be extremely remote because the cylinders would normally be stored upright with their valve covers tightly secured. Other factors considered were that the ventilation and scrubbing system, if operating as designed would eliminate virtually any release of chlorine to the environment. However, there is an RMP requirement that the toxic endpoint concentration for the alternative release extend offsite. Given that consideration o"

      "SummaryText": "f mitigation systems at the storage facility will reduce the atmospheric release rate of chlorine to such an extent that the endpoint would not extend off-site, it is impractical to consider these systems in defining an alternative release scenario. Therefore, the alternative release selected for RMP assumes the same release rate and duration as the worst-case (15 lb./min for 10 minutes), but it is assumed that the release occurs when more typical, rather than worst-case, meteorological conditions are present. Because this causes the release to be dispersed much more rapidly, the estimated toxic endpoint distance is much shorter than for the worst-case release scenario. For the RMP alternative release scenario, RMP*CompTM supplies a wind speed of 3 m/sec and atmospheric stability category D, resulting in an estimated Toxic Endpoint distance of 0.2 km (0.1 mi).\n\n4.0\tACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe bulk storage of chlorine is subject to the OSHA PSM standard with which the CUC facility is in compliance. The Program 3 Accident Prevention Program under the USEPA RMP includes the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard and governs the same processes and regulated substances at the site that are subject to 40 CFR Part 68.

The reportable quantity (RQ) is 10 lbs. of chlorine as applicable under EPCRA 304 and CERCLA 103. The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity of any listed chemical needs to be reported to appropriate regulatory authorities.\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe purpose of the CUC\u0092s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is to identify the planning and specific actions to be taken during an emergency that would maintain the quantity and quality of water, protect employees, minimize disruption to the public, and preserve property. This plan\u0092s objective is to ensure employee safety and health and to protect the community in the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Prompt internal and external communications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel are the key components of the EAP.\nThe EAP accomplishes the following:\n\u0095\tDevelop an Emergency Response Team (ERT) and identifies responsibilities for each team member.\n\u0095\tResponding agency (Department of Fire Emergency & Medical Services) will establish an Emergency Operations Center.\n\u0095\tEstablish procedures for internal and external notification and crisis communications, including emergency contact information.\n\u0095\tCUC will support responding agency to minimize the impact of an emergency on its facilities by developing general actions and procedures and p"

The HMERP establishes the framework to ensure that the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana\u0092s Islands (CNMI) will be adequately prepared to deal with hazards. The HMERP outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth\u0092s agencies, special districts, and local governments in a hazardous material incident, spill or potential release situation and coordinates response and recovery activities with regulatory response organizations active in hazardous materials incidents and the business community. The HMERP unifies the efforts of these groups and provides a comprehensive approach to reducing the effects of an emergency and/or hazardous material incident. This Plan addresses the four phases of emergency management (preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation), and parallels federal activities set forth in the National Response Plan.\nThe HMERP delineates the roles of the following agencies:\n\u0095\tDepartment of Public Safety (Fire Division)\n\u0095\tDepartment of Public Safety (Police)\n\u0095\tHomeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM)\n\u0095\tCommonwealth Utilities Corporation (CUC)\n\u0095\tPublic Information Officer (PIO)/Office of the Governor\n\u0095\tBureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality (BECQ)\n\u0095\tCommonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC)\n\u0095\tDepartment Of Public Works (DPW)\n\u0095\tDivision of Fish and Wildlife (DFW)\n\u0095\tAttorney General\u0092s Office (AGO)\n\u0095\tCommonwealth Ports Authority (CPA)\n\u0095\tOffice of The Mayors (Rota, Tinian & Northern Islands)\n\u0095\tPublic School System (PSS)\n\u0095\tAmerican Red Cross (ARC)\n\u0095\tDepartment of Community & Cultural Affairs (DCCA)\n\u0095\tFederal Agencies\no"

The Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC) serves as the communications link for this program.\n\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe CUC, under the RMP and PSM programs, has designed the chlorine storage facility and organized its management system to effectively address hazards and potential risks. Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety process. These programs are all documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is continuously available to employees."
