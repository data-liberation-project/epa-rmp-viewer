Facility Policy:  The owner & employees of Kelso Milling Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility information:  The primary activity is the blending and storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 150,000 pounds in our 2 10,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maxiuum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tractor-trailer with the capacity of 30,000 pounds.\n3.  The worst case scenerio:  The worst case release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of one storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 75,000 pounds (85% of 1 tanks capacity).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion is 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles. \n4.  The accidental release prevention program.  Kelso Milling Co. has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n5.  The five year accident history.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.  Nor to our knowledge have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or invironmental damage.\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n   "

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community Right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\nc.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standar 29 CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.  We have training with employees several times annually.  Twice a year meetings are held with the fire department to bring to attention and review any changes made to the already existing systems and procedures.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  There have been recent updates to all the valves on our storage tanks.  We have added extra lighting and better locking capabilities in hopes of deterring any stealing of anhydrous ammonia which has become a major problem amoung dealers and storage facilities.  Aside from any assessed maintenance there are no recommendations at this time."
