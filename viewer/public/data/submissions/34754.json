      "SummaryText": "FACILITY NAME\nPrewitt Escalante Generating Station (Escalante Station)\n\nFACILITY POLICIES & PROGRAMS\nEscalante Station is a 250 MW coal-fired steam electric generating unit located near Prewitt, New Mexico.  Escalante Station is owned and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. (Tri-State).  As a Tri-State facility, Escalante Station operates under the direction of the Tri-State Board of Directors.  The Tri-State Board of Directors have developed environmental health and safety policies requiring compliance with all applicable regulations.  These policies have been implemented for the protection of the employees, the public, and the environment.  To further the goals of the environmentl board policy, Tri-State management has also implemented a company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS), which is used to help set and achieve environmental goals, as well as to ensure environmental compliance.  \n\nIn addition to the compliance policies of the board of directors and the EMS, Escalante Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prepare for and provide a coordinated response to emergency situations.  The integrated approach is used to coordinate all aspects of emergency planning and response to provide for a comprehensive response to emergency situations.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is incorporated into the ICP to insure that the Risk Management Plan requirements are taken into consideration in the facility emergency planning and response efforts.  Additional information on the ICP can be found in the Emergency Response Program section below. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe primary function of the Escalante Station is to generate electric power for use throughout the region. Steam electric power generation involves the burning of a fuel source to heat water and produce steam.  The steam produced is used to spin a large turbine, which in turn rotates a generator that converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into ele"

In addition to producing power for regional consumption, the station also produces excess steam that is used at the nearby McKinley Paper Company paper mill.  \n\nWater is used at Escalante Station as an integral part of the power production process.  The majority of the water used by the station is for cooling with a portion being treated to produce potable water and process water.  Raw water for the plant is pumped from groundwater wells in the vicinity of the plant to an on-site raw water pond.   The water then undergoes treatment to make it suitable for the required processes.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at Escalante Station in amounts greater than the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) thresholds, 1,500 pounds and 2,500 pounds respectively.  Chlorine is used at the station to disinfect the water and prevent biological growth within water systems.  The use of chlorine in the circulating (cooling) water system helps to increase the efficiency and lifetime of the process, as well as to reduce the maintenance demands of the system.  The use of chlorine in the water treatment (potable and process water) system ensures that the water is disinfected and safe for human consumption in addition to providing the above benefits.\n\nThere are two chlorine systems at Escalante Station.  One for the treatment of the circulating water and one for the treatment of the process and potable water. Both systems operate under a vacuum, which draws chlorine directly from the cylinder regulators into the process.  A vacuum type system is used to minimize the need for pressurized lines.  The elimination of pressurized lines minimizes the potential for a large release and helps ensure the safety of the employees and the surrounding community.  For additional safety, only one cylinde"

The most significant difference between the water treatment and circulating water systems is the use of liquid chlorine feed in the circulating water system and the use of gaseous chlorine feed for the water treatment system.  This difference is necessary due mainly to the size of the water streams being treated and the associated chlorine demand of each system.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nThe water treatment chlorine process and the circulating water chlorine process both require a level three prevention program due to applicability of the OSHA PSM standard to each process.  To meet this requirement Escalante Station has developed an integrated PSM/RMP for both chlorine systems. Due to the similarity of the RMP and PSM rules, an integrated approach was used to ensure compliance, eliminate redundancy, and simplify documentation.  \n\nThe Escalante Station RMP/PSM Prevention Program includes detailed information on the following topics:  program management, employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis requirements, standard operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and audits.  Each of the prevention program elements listed above is included as an integral part of the RMP/PSM program and the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). This approach ensures that the chlorine system requirements are considered during emergency planning and response activities at the station.  Portions of the PSM/RMP prevention program are also integrated into the facility work management system to insure that PSM/RMP activities and considerations are addressed during routine maintenance activities at the station.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nEscalante Station is committed to ensuring the safety of its workers, the safety of the surr"

To this end, Escalante Station maintains relationships and/or written agreements with the local fire departments, hazardous materials emergency response (hazmat) team, and local emergency planning committees.  In addition, Escalante Station has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to meet all OSHA and EPA emergency response requirements.  The ICP assists in the evaluation of risks and in the preparation for and response to all types of emergencies.  The ICP sets forth procedures for emergency response and notification requirements for the public and government agencies.  The ICP also details the emergency response organization, the training requirements, and the required maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents at the Escalante Station in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAt this time there are no significant changes planned for the Escalante Station chlorine systems, however, routine activities such as employee training, emergency response drills, and preventative maintenance are ongoing to ensure safe operation of the system."
