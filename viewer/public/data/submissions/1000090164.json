During an emergency, the notification system can be used to communicate critical information including security threats, fires, and chemical releases to local businesses, the Milwaukee Fire Department, and Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\n\nThe SmartNotice service will be capable of reaching out to people in minutes.  During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel will be able to send out a notification from the web or call a 24/7 phone number staffed by Emergency Communications Network (ECN), the provider of SmartNotice, who will facilitate sending out the message on U.S. Energy's behalf.

The City of Milwaukee has approved the installation of the system. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Milwaukee Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Milwaukee County Emergency Management or Wisconsin Emergency Management, as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.\n\nU.S. Energy has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Energy Milwaukee West Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of six locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Milwaukee Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Milwaukee Fire Department and Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged within 20 seconds, the terminal security company will be notified and a representative will call the terminal phone in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer at the terminal to confirm whether help is needed, they will contact the terminal's on-call number."
