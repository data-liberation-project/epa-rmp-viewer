The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These four core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning, and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery, and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, Human Resources, Finance, and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and dependable operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Oil Milwaukee West Terminal is a petroleum storage and distribution terminal which receives refined petroleum products by pipeline and tank truck, stores petroleum products in oil storage tanks, and discharges those products by tank truck. The facility stores gasoline, diesel oil, additives, transmix, and ethanol onsite in various tanks with capacities ranging from 18,000 to 6.3 million gallons.  In addition, the terminal stores butane supplied by truck transports in two 30,000 gallon pressure vessels that is then transferred via piping and associated equipment onsite and blended into gasoline.  The quantity of butane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP require"

      "SummaryText": "ments.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Oil Milwaukee West Terminal's regulated butane process complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) #58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes including the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services LPG System requirements, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, and DOT's Hazardous Materials regulations.  The City of Milwaukee has approved the installation of the system. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Milwaukee Fire Department by calling 911, which may trigger involvement by Milwaukee County Emergency Management or Wisconsin Emergency Management, as necessary.  All personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual refresher hazardous materials training.\n\n\n\nU.S. Oil has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Oil Milwaukee West Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of six locations depending on location of the release and is the policy of the terminal to initially contact the Milwaukee Fire Department and request their assistance (via 911).  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Milwaukee Fire Department and Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged within 20 seconds, CEC (Terminal Security Company) will be notified and a representative will call the terminal phone in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer at the terminal to confirm whether help is needed, CEC will contact the terminal's on-call number.  CEC "

      "SummaryText": "will continue calling terminal associates until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation (they will not leave a voice message).\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include implementing a web-based notification system (SmartNotice) to enhance internal and external communication in the event of an emergency.  During an emergency, the notification system can be used to communicate critical information including security threats, fires, and chemical releases to local businesses, the Milwaukee Fire Department, and Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nThe SmartNotice service will be capable of reaching out to people in minutes.  During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel will be able to send out a notification from the web or call a 24/7 phone number staffed by Emergency Communications Network (ECN), the provider of SmartNotice, who will facilitate sending out the message on U.S. Oil's behalf.  Notifications can be sent via email, text, and/or phone depending on each individual preference.\n\n"
