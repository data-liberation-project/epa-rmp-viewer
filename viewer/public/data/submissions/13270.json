If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Carroll County Fire Department and request that they respond to an emergency.\n\nThis facility is a family owned and operated farm supply facility.  We farm and sell anhydrous ammonia to clients in the surrounding area.  We use anhydrous ammonia to sell and apply to crops as a fertilizer.  The storage system consists of two tanks, one is an 18,000 gallon tank and the other is a 6,000 gallon tank.  Both of these tanks have associated piping, valves, and other associated equipment.\n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of one 18,000 gallon tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting 95,940 pounds of released gas.  The distance to the enpoint is calculated as 3.6 miles.  This could potentially effect a maximum of 628 people.\n\nThis facility complies with  all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings since we began using anhydrous ammonia at our facility in 1955.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Carroll County Fire Department, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWe have no planned changes to improve safety."
