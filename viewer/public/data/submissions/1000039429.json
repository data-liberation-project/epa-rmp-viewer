The tank storage facility is covered by Federal Regulation 40 CFR Part 68.

The Kutz storage tank is a single pressure vessel that receives mixed NGL from the transport truck unloading docks at the site.  This tank is used as a holding tank for subsequent injection of the mixed liquid product into the mixed NGL pipeline.  The tank level is administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 90% of its capacity.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following hazardous materials that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nMixed NGL is received from transport trucks and is delivered into the storage tank.
