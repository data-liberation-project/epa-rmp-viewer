      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been completed by CSC, Inc. (CSC) for GENCO in accordance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nIn preparing this RMP, CSC used USEPA's Guidance Document Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses (40 CFR Part 68 [EPA 550-B-00-009, March 2009]; as well as USEPA's RMP*Comp! software (Version 1.07).\r\n\r\nGENCO operates a warehouse facility with hazardous substances that are covered under 40 CFR 68 (commonly known as the RMP rule).  This particular facility is dedicated to products managed on behalf of Unilever, Inc.  In addition to other material, the warehouse facility contains different types of aerosol products.  These aerosol products include propellants such as propane, butane, isobutane, difluoroethane and methyl ether - which are flammable materials listed in the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThese products are stored within specially designed areas of the warehouse. These locations have been engineered to store aerosol products, following guidelines established by Building Officials Code Association (BOCA) Guidelines, and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Guidelines.\r\n\r\nWhen the flammable materials of each aerosol container are added together, the amount stored on site can be in excess of the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGenco's conclusion is based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n1.  The largest container is a 14-ounce can of hair spray containing 0.301 pounds of isobutane.\r\n\r\n2.  The facility has an inventory of 166,225 cases of aerosols.  At 12 cans per case, this is equivalent to 1,994,700 cans of aerosols containing the equivalent of 600,405 pounds of isobutane.  As stated above the RMP threshold is 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario, determined in accordance with the RMP rule and USEPA guidance, would be the rupture and complete release of all of the flammable material contained in the largest aero"

      "SummaryText": "sol container stored at the facility.  This has been determined to be a release of 0.301 pounds (all assumed to be isobutane for the purposes of this evaluation).\r\n\r\nIf this quantity of isobutane were to be released and form an explosive vapor cloud, and if a source of ignition caused an explosion, the release could possibly affect a radius of approximately 0.005 miles (26 feet).  This distance is referred to as the end-point by the RMP rule (and USEPA guidance).\r\n\r\nNo public receptors are within the 0.005 mile end-point radius.\r\n\r\nThese results are believed to be very conservative.  EPA's guidance suggests that the release of the entire quantity of a container into a vapor cloud that ignites and explodes is highly unlikely.  EPA's endpoint determination guidance is similarly conservative and protective. \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant or flammable material at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage on site or any damages off-site.\r\n\r\nGenco's ongoing goal is to prevent accidental releases of all materials, including regulated materials, through the proper design, operation and maintenance of our facilites and the proper training of our employees.  Our preventive measures include procedures and training programs for handling all materials - including aerosols.\r\n\r\nIf, despite our efforts, such a release would occur, our personnel would implement our Emergency Response Plan - which includes notification of the local Fire Department and others as necessary and appropriate.\r\n\r\nGenco maintains an excellent working relationship with emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response.\r\n\r\nOur written programs and procedures are updated as necessary to reflect changes in personnel or legal requirements.\r\n\r\nDuring the preparation of this Risk Management Plan, we have found our facility to be classified as a Program 1 facility.
