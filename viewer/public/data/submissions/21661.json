OUR PLANT IS IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR FACILITY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL OF THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nTHE PLANT CONSIST OF 1-12000 GALLON TANK WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 53,000 POUNDS.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A GAS RELEASE OF 53,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.63 MILES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 200 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE AND RELEASE A TOTAL OF 11,908 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES, ALSO EFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 182 AREA CITIZENS.  PUBLIC RECEPTORS IN THE AREA INCLUDE A SCHOOL, RESIDENCES AND A PUBLIC PARK.\n\nSINCE THIS FACILITY WAS RECENTLY PURCHASED AFTER THE FIRST OF THE  YEAR, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AN INJURY ACCIDENT OR CAUSE ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE.  OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN RECENTLY TRAINED IN THE DANGERS OF AMMONIA AS WELL AS THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATING PROCEDURES OF A TYPICAL ANHYDROUS AMMONIA PLANT.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, PROVIDE CLEAN SAFETY WATER DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DISTRICT (SOME EMPLOYEES ARE FIRE DISTRICT MEMBERS) AND THEY HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE DANGEROUS CHARACTERISTICS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'LL ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
