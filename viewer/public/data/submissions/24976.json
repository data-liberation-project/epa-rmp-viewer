THE FACILITY HAS 1-30,000 AND 1-11,000 GALLON TANKS WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 184,000 POUNDS.  THE TANK IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE  LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR TANKS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL OF THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 132,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.5 MILES AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 125 AREA CITIZENS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD RELEASE 11,908 LBS OF AMMONIA THROUGH THE TRANSFER HOSE AND WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 100 PEOPLE.\n\n THIS COMPANY'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRAIN EMPLOYEES IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON A REGULAR BASIS.   THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF THE TYPICAL FACILITY.  THE EMPLOYEEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  ABOVE ALL, THEY MAKE SURE TO HAVE CLEAN SAFETY WATER ON HAND DURING  AMMONIA OPERATIONS.   OUR SAFETY RECORD  ALLOWS US TO PROUDLY REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURY ACCIDENTS AT THIS PLANT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH OUR THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THEY ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'VE ALSO, AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
