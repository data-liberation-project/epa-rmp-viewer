Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThis facility is regulated under 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response and\r\n29 CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans. Chemicals Incorporated Bay city Site fully\r\ncomplies with these regulations with employee training and written plans. Additionally, the facility closely communicates with local emergency response group.\r\n2. Source and Substances Handled\r\nPrimary Activities: Organic Chemicals and specialty chemicals Toll Manufacturer\r\nUse of Substances:\r\nPropylene oxide: 10125 lbs (max), in cylinders (375 lbs net)\r\n3.I.a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario: Failure of 2 cylinders of 375 lbs each of propylene oxide (total: 750 lbs) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 10.8 minute period. The 750 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.4 miles.\r\nI.b. Toxic Alternative Scenario: Failure of transfer hose/line or cylinder releasing 375 lbs (one cylinder) of propylene oxide inside a diked area with sumps and deluge water available and resulting in the complete release of contents over a 10 minute period. The 375 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.1 miles.\r\nMethyl chloride: 45000 lbs (max), in tank\r\n3.II.a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario: Failure of tank holding 45000 lbs of methyl chloride with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 10 minute period. The material released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 2.1 miles.\r\nII.b. Toxic Alternative Scenario: Hole in liquid space of tank, 42 liquid above hole, releasing methyl chloride for 30 minutes at teh rate of 1070 lbs/min within a diked area with sumps and sprinkler/deluge water available. The material released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.4 miles.\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Sp"

Five Year Accident History Summary\r\nNo Accidents involving Propylene oxide.\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\nChemicals Incorporated's Emergency Response Program is tailored to the varied processes inherent to a small\r\nspecialty chemical toll manufacturer. The plan rests on response trained operators and a 24 hour a day\r\nemergency coordinator along with two alternate coordinators to handle notifications and request for\r\nresponse from outside agencies such as Matagorda Count LEPC, Bay City Fire Department, and ambulance services.\r\nSpecial equipment and personal protective gear is on hand for containing releases. Training of employees is\r\nconducted to repair any possible leaking lines, tanks/containers. Additionally, the facility has 2.4 million gallon fire water reservoir and associated fire suppression/deluge system for fire fighting service.\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAdditional passive and active mitigation strategies, including automated deluge systems, are being evaluated and installed for various equipment and tanks."
