The Terminal will use the Catano dock facilities to receive and ship product. PUMA is required to comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 because the facility will store propane and butane on-site in quantities exceeding the rule threshold quantity for these substances. The following executive summary is provided in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nPUMA is committed to operating and maintaining its butane and propane operations (generically referred to as liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) in a safe and responsible manner. PUMA has developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions at the facility, including those required under the USEPA RMP rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The facility is also subject to other emergency plan regulations such as those under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (ECPRA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) rules.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances\r\nPUMA operates a petroleum product terminal located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which will handle butane and propane, which are regulated flammable substances under R"

The LPG consists of 25 existing bullet tanks, and one existing (1) Sphere. The existing butane and propane bullets were upgraded and processes and safety system are newly built. No operation has been conducted by PUMA since the acquisition and no record from previous owner operation has been recorded of an RMP regulated chemical. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has developed an emergency response program, including a written emergency response plan with notification, emergency medical treatment, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPUMA continually strives to improve process safety. The facility's butane and propane processes are newly built and designed in accordance with recognized safety industry standards and/or government requirements. Trafigura expects that on-going programs such as process hazard analyses, compliance audits, and incident investigations will result in continual improvements to process safety."
