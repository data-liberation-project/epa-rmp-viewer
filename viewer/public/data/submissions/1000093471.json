The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nWestlake implemented a project that significantly modifies the potential footprint of a methyl mercaptan release from the site.  Historically, the site purchased methyl mercaptan as a raw material.  Due to the toxic nature of methyl mercaptan, Westlake invested in facilities to import an alternate raw material that dissociates into methyl mercaptan and other components on an as needed basis.  This resulted in no on-site storage of methyl mercaptan.  The alternative release scenario represented in the current RMP is from the potential in process losses of the generated methyl mercaptan.\r\n\r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility. Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n\r\n2.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.  PHAs are revalidated at least every 5-years by a team of process operators and unit engineers.\r\n\r\n3.  Following a maintenance turnaround or change implementation, Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews are conducted to ensure that the process is safe to operate, procedures are in place and affected personnel are adequately trained to operate or maintain the process.\r\n\r\n4.  The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, ins"

Westlake also works closely with the City of Deer Park's Department of Emergency Services and Harris County's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management (OHSEM).  \r\n\r\nThis coordination includes periodic meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, community members, and industry representatives. Shell, Pemex and Westlake maintain trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents. \r\n\r\nWestlake also maintains 24-hour communications capability with relevant public agencies, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire department, local pollution control agencies, federal agencies, etc.).  Westlake Health, Safety and Environmental personnel are trained to make required notifications to the public agencies as well as to the public via the CAER phone line and emails to the Deer Park Community Advisory Council in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nWestlake (through Shell and Pemex) maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment. This program consists of policies and procedures for responding to releases, including actions to be taken in the event of a fire, explosion, or chemical release. These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, and personnel accountability plans. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.

Part of our program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. This is accomplished through Process Hazard Analyses and periodic review of policies and procedures. Additionally, the site has various safety features to detect, contain and control, and mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\r\n\r\n1. Release detection\r\n   Process alarms\r\n   Operator surveillance\r\n   Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \r\n\r\n2.
