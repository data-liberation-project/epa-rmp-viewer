This commitment is demonstrated by MWC's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is MWC'S policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such releases do occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the St. Johns Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b))\r\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is ammonia (anhydrous). The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 65,000 pounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes).   \r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. Our ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nInformation related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the facility has been compiled. Prior to conducting the initial and subsequent hazard analysis, the process safety information was reviewed and utilized in identifying and mitigating recognized hazards. The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.   \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \r\nComprehensive studies are conducted to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and c"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: \r\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: \r\nIncidents that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are promptly investigated. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All incident reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: \r\nMWC strongly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. \r\n\r\nContractors: \r\nContractors are utilized to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
