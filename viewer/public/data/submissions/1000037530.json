A Compliance Audit was completed in November 14-17, 2011. The initial Process Hazard Analysis was completed in November 21, 2003 and the PHA was revalidated on December 1, 2008 and November 11, 2013. Recommendations were generated during the 2003 PHA session, 2008 and 2013 revalidation studies, and the 2011 Compliance Audit to improve safety at the facility."

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors throughout the facility which will alert plant personnel in the event of an ammonia detection.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that Bama Pie has not had any RMP reportable accidents in the last five years (June 2008 - June 2013).  Such accidents would involve serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  \r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBama Pie has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to 24-hour Hazmat Technician Level initially and receives an 8-hour refresher on an annual basis.  Incident Commanders also receive 8-hour initial training and 8-hour annual refresher training.  Emergency Response Team m"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.)\tTo save lives.\r\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\r\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nBama Pie maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Bama Pie facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  Prior to December 2003, the facility operated a small ammonia refrigeration system that was not applicable to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation.  The facility underwent a major expansion, and operations on the newly expanded system began in December 2003.  As a result of the expansion, the facility is required to comply with Program Level 3 of the EPA RMP.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 15.5 Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nThe to"
