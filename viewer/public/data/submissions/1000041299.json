Surfactants are used in household, personal care and industrial applications.  It is Croda's policy to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations. Croda is in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program, 40 CFR Part 68. The 5-year RMP submission is being made in accordance with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 68-190(b)(1).\r\n\r\nThe Croda Atlas Point site conducts hazard analysis reviews prior to the design, construction and operation of any process unit.  Records are kept of each hazard review and the actions implemented as an outcome of the review are documented.  Detailed information relating to Croda's accidental release prevention program is provided in the Accidental Release Prevention Program section.\r\n\r\nThe Croda site maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the emergency response program.  It is Croda's policy to respond in an efficient and effective manner to any emergency that occurs at the Croda Atlas Point site. Croda personnel regularly prepare for emergencies by conducting emergency drills that have included the local fire department.  A group of Croda employees have been trained to act as emergency responders, incident commanders and duty managers.  Croda emergency personnel can be reached 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nCroda has made safety performance a priority at the Atlas Point facility.  We have partnered with OSHA in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) a voluntary program for worksites that show excellence in occupational safety and health. This shows Croda's commitment to effective employee protection beyond the requirements of OSHA standards. As a VPP STAR Worksite, Cr"

As a result, the Atlas Point worksite has a lost workday incidence rate 50 percent below the average of its industry.\r\n\r\nThe Croda Atlas Point site also has a Community Advisory Council, which meets quarterly to foster communication with our neighbors and answer questions of concern.  Participants include the Delaware State Police, the Delaware Bridge and River Authority, a local school district, local businesses and government agencies, as well as local community organizations.  \r\n\r\n2.\tRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Croda Atlas Point site stores ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in quantities that exceed threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds, as defined in 40 CFR 68.115.  Both ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are listed as toxic substances under 40 CFR 68.130. The Croda site does not store any additional substances in quantities greater than those specified under 40 CFR 68.130.  Both substances are used on-site in chemical reactions to make surfactants, which are sold as ingredients for a variety of consumer and industrial products.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario determined by Croda involves the on-site storage of ethylene oxide in an aboveground tank. The alternative release scenarios reviewed by Croda include the transfer and unloading of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide from a railcar to the on-site aboveground tanks.  The largest quantities of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide that are stored at the Croda site are in the respective storage tanks.  Written procedures limit the quantity stored in the on-site tanks and both storage tanks are located outside in open areas to allow ample ventilation.  The tanks are located in diked areas which would contain potential spills and slow the release into the air.  An emergency spill retention area, or spill sump, is located south of the tanks and"

Due to the complex nature of the properties of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide when stored as liquids, Croda utilized the National Atmospheric Organization's ALOHA model for the alternative release scenarios for ethylene oxide and propylene oxide because it better represents substances liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nCroda obtained public and environmental receptor data through MARPLOT, a desktop mapping program sponsored by the EPA, US Bureau of Census, US Geological Society, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Transportation and Federal Emergency Management Agency.\r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3 specified in 40 CFR 68.65 to 68.87. The components include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor work.\r\n\r\nSome of the safety features in use, categoried as passive or active mitigation systems include the following.\r\n\r\n- A network of 35 combustible gas sensors located strategically to detect leaks or loss of containment. Leak detection by the sensors will automatically trigger a staged response, starting with an alarm and progressing to water deluge, depending on the extent of the leak.\r\n\r\n- Ethylene oxide gas sensors worn by personnel in the process area.  These sensors alarm if ppm levels of ethylene oxide are detected, allowing personnel to respond prior to exposure to harmful concentrations.  T"

The spill sump was designed to contain releases from a railcar and both the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.  The capacity of the spill sump is 18,750 cubic feet.  The spill sump confines the chemical and is equipped with a water spray system to dilute and contain the spill, thereby reducing the amount released to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n- A diked area surrounds the storage tank area and is approximately 65 feet long by 24 feet wide.  The diked area captures spills and directs the liquid to the spill sump.  The remote location collects leaks of flammable liquid away from process equipment to prevent the spread of fire.\r\n\r\n- A water deluge system is installed to quench fires and absorb leaks of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.  It is designed based upon the National Fire Protection (NFPA) standards.\r\n\r\n- A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is installed to improve system monitoring and control. This system monitors key parameters such as temperature and pressure and will automatically set the system to a safe state should an upset occur. A redundant interlock system, independent of the PLC, is in place to monitor and set to a safe state if critical conditions are encountered and the PLC does not respond. \r\n\r\n- Alarms are wired and controlled through the PLC and sound an audible alarm as well as a visual flag.  Alarms are early warning systems which send an alert of potential leaks. \r\n\r\n- Emergency backup power for storage tank area lighting and control components.\r\n\r\n- A packed column scrubber is installed to capture emissions vented during ethylene oxide and propylene oxide unloading operations. The scrubber was designed to remove emissions at a much higher than normal concentration and rate to insure that a potential upset condition would be controlled.\r\n\r\n- A dispersion stack for the relief valve outl"

The stack insures that the concentrations at the ground level would be less than OSHA's Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) levels. The modeling used to design the stack included scenarios provided by DNREC and incorporated worst case scenario features.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Croda performs a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR)inspection twice annually, which will detect small leaks and repair them before they become a hazard. \r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the last five years the Croda Atlas Point facility has had no accidental releases from the ethylene oxide or propylene oxide processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Emergency Response section, specified in 40 CFR 68.90 to 68.95.\r\nCroda maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the site's emergency response program. The local community emergency response organization, Hollaway Terrace Fire Department, has received a copy of the ICP and has included it in the community emergency response plan. The ICP includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n- Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\r\n- Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures.\r\n- Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance. This includes a public address system throughout the worksite used to give verbal instructions in the case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the site's emergency response program, as included in the ICP, includes procedures for the use of the site's emergency response equipment and for"

The emergency response plan includes procedures to review and update the ICP to reflect changes at the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks. Croda trains all employees in the applicable procedures and informs them of changes at the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.\r\n\r\n6. Recent Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThrough the Process Hazard Review that is performed every five years, the safety of the systems is continuously improved.  As recommended in the most recent Process Hazard Review, new equipment was purchased and installed to close railcar valves from a remote location.  In the case of a hose failure (the Alternative Release Scenario) this new equipment allows the flow from the railcar to be stopped without approaching the railcar, therby avoiding personnel exposure to the leak.  As new opportunities to improve safety are identified they will be evaluated and implemented as appropriate."
