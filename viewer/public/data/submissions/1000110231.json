      "SummaryText": "The Wemlinger Water Purification Facility treats drinking water for the City of Aurora.  Chlorine is used for disinfection to meet CDPHE and EPA drinking water regulations.  Chlorine is a reliable, powerful, and cost-effective way to protect public health.\n\nThe Wemlinger WPF was constructed in 1983 and was the second of three water treatment facilities built.  The facility has undergone three major construction projects for capacity expansion and facility improvements.  The first in 1987, the second in 2003 and the third in 2020.  During the 2003 renovation, significant improvements for the chlorine and other chemical systems were completed. In 2010 and 2012, a nitrogen purge system and an automatic valve closing system was installed.\n\nSafety is an integral part of Wemlinger's operation when it comes to chlorine.  Safeguards on the system include air monitoring, ton container auto closers, pressure and temperature monitors, video surveillance, restricted access, and multiple daily inspections of the equipment by staff.\n\nIn accordance with Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the facility has established a Program 2 Prevention Program as part of the Risk Management Program and Plan.  The overall goal for the program is to reduce the risk of injury or death to employees, the public, and the environment from accidental release of chemicals.\n\nRequirements for the Program 2 Prevention Program include:\nSafety Information\nHazard Review\nWritten Operating Procedures\nTraining\nMaintenance\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\n\nWemlinger has not had any accidents in the last 5 years which is a reflection of our commitment to chorine safety. Wemlinger's Emergency Response Program includes employee training and on-site training with the Aurora Fire Department."
