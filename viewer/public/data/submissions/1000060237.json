This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Jackson Terminal located in Jackson County, Minnesota, is owned and operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline and is stored in nine above ground storage tanks.  The tanks  are equipped with automatic level indicators and alarms and automatic inlet propane shutoff valves to allow for unattended filling from a remote pipeline control facility.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the tank filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection. The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tanks into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.    The trace odorant remains present in the propane when it is loaded into the transport trucks.  The flammable ethyl mercaptan at the facility is never present above the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation.  \r\n\r\nThe Jackson Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantit"

As has been noted earlier, ethyl mercaptan is also present in storage at the facility, but in only a limited amount which is well below the threshold quantity.  The terminal also receives and loads a gasoline product, but this material is not a covered flammable in the RMP Regulation.  \r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Jackson Terminal.  The operations at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation  and the OSHA PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the RMP accident prevention program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the program.  A complete fourteen issue safety management program, identical to the program in use at other OSHA PSM facilities, has been implemented at Jackson Terminal.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the terminal's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.

This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Jackson Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various operations are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each portion of the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Jackson Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of storage and terminal operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of any new equipment.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\r\n\r\nTanker loading operations at the terminal are primarily carried out by each individual transport truck driver.  Drivers are required to show that they understand the procedures required to safely load their trucks before they are allowed to load propane at the Jackson Terminal.
