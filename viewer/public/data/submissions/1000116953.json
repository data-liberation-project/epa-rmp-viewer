The Terminal stores and handles various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and petroleum based additives. This document pertains to the Butane Blending Process operated at this facility, which has been identified as a Program Level 3 process.\n\nThe Dallas Terminal in Dallas, TX is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Global believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding EHS performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Global has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe RMP regulated substance handled at this facility is butane, a flammable gas handled as a liquid under pressure (LPG). By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Global is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive trai"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\nPREVENTION MEASURES\n\nGlobal's accidental release prevention programs along with emergency planning and response programs allow affective management of the hazards posed by Butane to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Dallas Terminal:\n\n01) Employee Participation\n02) Process Safety Information\n03) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n04) Standard Operating Procedures\n05) EHS and Operator Training\n06) Contractors\n07) Pre-startup Safety Review\n08) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n09) Work Permits\n10) Management of Change\n11) EHS Accident or Potential/Actual Catastrophic Event Investigation\n12) Emergency Response\n13) Compliance Audits\n14) Trade Secrets\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of the Global Companies - Dallas Terminal prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Global and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs.
