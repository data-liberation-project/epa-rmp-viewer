Lima has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Lima began operations in 2009. This is the initial RMP Submittal for Lima.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nLima is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Lima uses unleaded gasoline as a denaturant to make ethanol produced at the facility unfit for human consumption. Lima also uses aqueous ammonia for pH control directly in the process. In the event of a significant emergency, including an accidental release of flammable or toxic materials, it is the policy of Lima to notify appropriate authorities and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAs previously mentioned, Lima's ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (most commonly unleaded gasoline) to render ethanol produced by the facility unfit for human consumption. The unleaded gasoline is stored in an aboveground tank as a liquid under atmospheric pressure and is mixed with ethanol prior to transport. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's on-site tank farm area which is equipped with secondary containment.  Denaturant used by the facility commonly contains pentane in varying percentages.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site would be approximately 56,400 gallons or 331,830 pounds (approximately 16,591.5 pounds of which is pentane).  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard at 29 CFR 1910.119, Lima has complied with the EPA requirements at 40 CFR Part 68.

      "SummaryText": " work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. A PHA for a variety of hazardous processes at the facility was conducted in April 2011. Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nLima does not have a history of accidents involving regulated chemcials which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nLima has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored and used at the facility. These efforts have been coordinated with state and federal regulating agencies and local responders. Lima also participates in the SING Group to ensure adequate fire suppression equipment are available in case of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs previously mentioned, Lima is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. Lima management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. Lima will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n"
