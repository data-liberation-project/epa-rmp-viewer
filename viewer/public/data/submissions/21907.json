Eastman has approximately 5300 customers worldwide and posted 1998 sales of $4.48 billion. With corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Eastman employs 16,100 people in more than 30 countries.\n\nThe Texas Eastman Division of Eastman Chemical Company has its main plant facility located on a 6000-acre site in Harrison County near Longview, Texas.  From its beginning in 1950, Texas Eastman has grown into one of the largest petrochemical plants in Texas.\n\nThe Texas Eastman plant site includes Huntsman Corporation's polypropylene unit within its plant boundaries.  The polypropylene unit was purchased from Eastman Chemical Company in 1994.  The polypropylene unit is integrated into the Texas Eastman Division safety and emergency response practices and processes and is considered part of the Texas Eastman plant site for purposes of compliance with this regulation.\n\nThe Texas Eastman plantsite purchases propane, ethane and natural gas for its principal raw materials.  From these raw materials, Texas Eastman manufactures over 40 different chemical intermediates, solvents, coatings, resins and plastics.  No consumer items are made directly at Texas Eastman.  Instead, the Texas Eastman and Huntsman products are supplied to industrial customers for use in the manufacture of hundreds of consumer items which enhance the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.  These products include automobile interiors, paints, tires, food preservatives, adhesives, furniture, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, disposable baby diapers, food packaging, toys, soft drink bottles, floor polish and waxes, printing inks, latex paint, fiberglass, fabric and many other consumer and industrial products.\n\nRegulated Substances Description\n\nTexas Eastman Division's Longview site uses and processes a number of flammable gases and liquids such as acetaldehyde, ethylene, and natural gasoline (a mixture conta"

In addition, Texas Eastman has seven toxic substances listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.  These are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia (30%), chlorine, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde solution, isobutyronitrile and titanium tetrachloride\n\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\n\nBasic Information:\nTexas Eastman Division uses flammable gases and liquids in many of its operations.  Three examples of flammables used include acetaldehyde, natural gasoline and ethylene. Acetaldehyde is a colorless gas with a pungent choking odor.  Natural gasoline is a colorless volatile liquid with a petroleum-like odor.  Ethylene is a colorless gas with a sweet odor. All three of these materials are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion. \n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division produces acetaldehyde for sale to outside customers who convert it into other chemicals found in common household items such as aspirin, mustard, ketchup, dill pickles and Vitamin B-12. Natural gasoline is used as one of the basic feedstocks for the Texas Eastman plant site.
