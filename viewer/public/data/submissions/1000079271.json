Helix Water District is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very dilligent about safety for its employees, the communities where its facilities are located, and customers.  Helix Water District staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.  \n\n \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 48,000 pounds of chlorine kept in 24 one-ton containers.  \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Chlorination System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, two alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Chlorination System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, Helix Water District has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event unlikely.  In addition to the safety practices of the"

Facility has a scrubber, rupture discs, and chlorine gas detection.  For protection of employees and responders, safety showers and respiratory equipment are available on site.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Helix Water District to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n\n\nA?68.65    Process Safety Information (PSI) \n\nA?68.67    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA?68.69 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\nA?68.71    Training (TRN)\n\nA?68.73    Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nA?68.75    Management of Change (MOC)\n\nA?68.77    Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\nA?68.79    Compliance Audits (CA)\n\nA?68.81    Incident Investigation (II)\n\nA?68.83    Employee Participation (EP)\n\nA?68.85    Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\nA?68.87    Contractors (CO)\n\nA?68.90    Emergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of chlorine at the facility in the previous five (5) years.  \n\n\n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\n\nThe use of flammable materials at Helix Water District is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.
