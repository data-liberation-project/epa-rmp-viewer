To supply treated water to its customers, raw water is pumped from the Houston County Lake, filtered, and purified to make it safe for human consumption.  In this process, chlorine is used to disinfect the water.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the treatment process.  As chlorine and ammonia are classified as hazardous chemicals, we have a Risk Management Program in place.\n\nThe Houston County WCID # 1 has always employed safety standards to prevent injuries and eliminate health hazards to our workers and others within our vicinity.  We have not had any chlorine related incidents, accidents, or injuries at our Plant.\n\nWe at the Houston County WCID # 1 are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, safe operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training, associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Houston County WCID # 1 was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard,1967 Edition.  The District maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs, associated with all processes.  We conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis are inspection and training.  The studies are indertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operation, and are validated annually.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a t"

These procedures address various modes of operation, such as startups, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  This information is reviewed regularly, and is readily accessible to operators and personnel involved.\n\nThe Houston County WCID # 1 has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees  are competent in operating procedures associated with the processes.  Refresher training is provided at least twice a year, and more often if needed.\n\nDocumented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations, are also carried out.  Equipment examined by these inspections include, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  These personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiecies, identified by the maintenance inspections, are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nProcedures are in place at the Houston County WCID # 1 to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  Reviews of maintenance procedures are conducted on a monthly basis.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee, whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions, are promptly made aware of, and offered training to deal with the modification.  Reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures, are suitable, prior to placing any new or modified equipment into operation.\n\nThe Houston County WCID # 1 conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under RMP rules are"

The employees at the Houston County WCID # 1 are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvement.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis.\n\nThe Houston County WCID # 1 has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the past five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nA written Emergency Evacuation Procedure dealing with accidental releases of hazardous materials is in place.  This plan includes the procedure in notifying the Houston County Emergency Management Office, the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality, and Chemtrec.   To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Our Plan is also updated, as needed, to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The Plan will also be modified to address any other safety issues that arise.\n"
