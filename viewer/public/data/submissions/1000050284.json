This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule.  The facility is covered by the rule because it processes anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory thresholds.  The facility is a meat processing plant that uses anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is a listed chemical due to toxicity.  The facility's anhydrous ammonia inventory is 112,162 lbs.   \n\n\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years.  The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity.  The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement.  The RMP will be made available to the public.  The purpose of this project was to compile the information and materials necessary to submit an updated RMP.\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia.  The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that 74,000 pounds of ammonia was released from the intermediate accumulator and associated piping to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP Comp software program.  The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 4.1 miles.   It was further determined that within 4.1 miles of the facility there is a population of 6,789 people.  The public receptors id"

      "SummaryText": "entified within 4.1 miles of the facility are residences, schools, a hospital, recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas.  A state wildlife management area was the only environmental receptor identified within 4.1 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario used for this analysis was the release of the largest relief valve on the system from overpressurization. The largest surge relief valve has a capacity of 1,706 lb/min air or 1,018 lb/min of ammonia. For the analysis, the full release was 10,180 lbs of ammonia over a 10 minute period. This scenario was chosen due the more common probability of release from these types of relief valves.  In this scenario, 10,180 pounds of ammonia are released over a 10-minute period. The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 0.6 miles. The population within 0.6 miles of the facility was determined to be 89. Commercial/industrial areas were the only public or environmental receptors identified within 0.6 miles of the facility. \n\n\n\nOther alternative releases considered a release of ammonia from the intermediate accumulator and associated piping under more normal operating conditions (approximately 38% operating capacity) and the release from piping due to fire in equipment. Alternative cases not selected were those due to transfer hose releases, process piping failures and shipping container breakage. After careful consideration of the potential to occur weighed with the impacts of the scenario, the alternative scenario as stated above from vessel overpressurization through relief valves was determined to be the most probable occurrence with greatest impact.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analyses data and information concerning the facility and the facility's implementation of the risk management program are included in the risk management plan documented in this report.\n\n\n\nThe facility's 5 year accident history includes three incidents:  \n\n\n\nA release of approximately 21,660 lbs of ammonia o"

No injuries or deaths were associated with this release.\n\n\n\nAn equipment failure on an Evapco air unit caused a release of approximately 5 pounds of ammonia on June 29, 2014.  One contractor was injured on-site due to this release.\n\n\n\nA release of approximately 350 lbs of ammonia occurred on July 25, 2014 when a pressure relief valve lifted before the factory set point.  No injuries or deaths were associated with this event.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan in place to provide a limited emergency response to a release situation.  A hazmat team is available on site to respond to emergency releases.  The facility also coordinates with the Schuyler Fire Department and Colfax County LEPC to respond to emergency releases.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nProcesses to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions facility is continuously working to improve process safety at the facility.  Facility practices to improve safety include:  \n\n\n\nFacility Tours are completed with the local Fire Department on an annual basis. \n\n\n\nFacility holds a Safety Day to recognize all employees and support safety efforts.\n\n\n\nThere are quarterly PSM meetings that are held with the upper management group at the facility.\n\n\n\nAnnual PSM training is completed with all Cargill employees at the facility\n\n\n\nNew Hire employees receive PSM orientation training during their initial training period.\n\n\n\nFacility conducts regular HazMat drills and annual training for on-site HazMat team.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts regular plant evacuation drills.\n\n\n\n   "
