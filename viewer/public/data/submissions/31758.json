The facility is committed to continue meeting its compliance obligations with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps to prevent the release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from these processes. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nThe City of La Porte Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 2101 Boyd Boulevard, La Porte, Indiana, 46350-6745 . The facility has several distinct processes that treat wastewater prior to discharge. Two of those processes, the chlorination process and the dechlorination process, utilize chemicals regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program Rule: chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The chlorinination process adds chlorine gas to wastewater to reduce bacteria. The dechlorination process adds sulfur dioxide to the wastewater to remove excess chlorine prior to discharge. The City of La Porte Wastewater Treatment Plant is required by its NPDES permit to chlorinate and dechlorinate during the period April 1 through October 31 annually. Administrative procedures have been established to ensure that neither chlorine nor sulfur dioxide is on site when chlorination and dechlorination is not required. The chlorination and dechlorination processes were designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes at the time of construction. Each process has a gas detection / warning system, providing an alarm should concentration of chlorine or sulfur dioxide exceed 1 part per million. The chlorination and d"

The plan is coordinated with the City of La Porte Fire Department. Emergency response drills simulating chemical release and subsequent injuries have been conducted at the facility. These drills have involved the La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee, the City of La Porte Fire and Police Departments, the La Porte County HAZMAT Team, the La Porte Hospital, and local Red Cross representatives."
