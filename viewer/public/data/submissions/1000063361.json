Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Mayfield Dairy Farms (MDF) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of MDF\u00bfs high degree of commitment to public safety and service, MDF is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Mayfield Dairy Farms facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe general accidental release prevention program"

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nA five-year accident history has been updated and included in the RMP.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future incidents, Mayfield Dairy Farms has improved training practices to ensure all employees understand the proper procedures for dealing with any ammonia release.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.
