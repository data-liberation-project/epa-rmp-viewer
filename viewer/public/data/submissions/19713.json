It is Marinovich \nCold Storage, Inc.'s policy to comply with all applicable governmental \nregulations.  Further, it is Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc.'s objective to be a \nresponsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. emphasizes safe and environmentally sound \noperating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In \naddition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive \ntraining in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency \naction plan has been prepared for Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc. and a chain of \ncommand to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit \nChecklist which is used to evaluate compliance with Process Safety \nManagement (PSM) and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three \nyears, Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc. audits these programs and any findings of \nnoncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are \ncorrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. owns and operates a cold storage facility located \nat 303A Salinas Road in Pajaro, California.  There are two refrigeration systems \ncurrently at the facility, the original (or main) refrigeration system and a second \nsystem based in engine room #2.  The original refrigeration system was installed \nin 1946.  The second refrigeration system (based in engine room #2) was \ninstalled in 1970.  Both refrigeration systems have been upgraded and \nmodernized several times over the years.\n\nIn both of the refrigeration systems at Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc., anhydrous \nammonia is used as t"

Although the systems normally operate independently, it is \npossible to shut down engine room #2 and operate the cold storage rooms \nserviced by engine room #2 from the main refrigeration system.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the \nrefrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, portions of \nthe refrigeration system can be pumped down to evacuate the ammonia from \nthe system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver in the original (main) \nrefrigeration system is 4,930 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could \nimpair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc.'s ammonia-based refrigeration systems are \nconsidered Program 3 processes, both release scenarios were evaluated in the \noffsite consequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must"

The circle \nalso defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the \ncontents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc., the alternative \nrelease scenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard \nAnalysis (PHA) for the ammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release \nevent with a high discharge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite \nimpact.  A failure of one of the pump seals was identified in the PHA as having a \nmedium probability of occurrence with a possible high discharge rate, and \ntherefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.    \n\nMarinovich Cold Storage, Inc. has analyzed the offsite consequences of the \nworst-case and alternative release scenarios.   For the worst-case release \nscenario, the release of 4,930 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period within the \nengine room, the plume would travel 0.6 miles at concentrations at or above the \nendpoint.

For a release of 350 \npounds of ammonia at a rate of 7.3 lb/min of anhydrous ammonia within a \nbuilding, the model calculated that the plume would travel 0.1 mile at \nconcentrations at or above the endpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the \npopulation potentially affected within this alternative release scenario circle is 62 \npersons.  There were no environmental receptors within the alternative release \nscenario circle. \n\nAll of the refrigeration equipment involved in the above described release \nscenarios is physically located within buildings.  As such, the results of the \ndispersion modeling performed as part of this offsite consequence analysis \nincorporate a mitigation factor which assumes that the release is within an \nenclosed space, in direct contact with the outside air. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release \nprevention program, has been developed at Marinovich Cold Storage, Inc. to \naddress the anhydrous ammonia system.
