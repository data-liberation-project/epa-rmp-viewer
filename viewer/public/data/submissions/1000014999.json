Improved storage and building techniques along with continued research by Cornell University staff on site has allowed the company to meet industry demands for Controlled Atmosphere (CA) storage in the continuously evolving and changing agricultural and produce industry.\n\nIn CA storage, the temperature, humidity, oxygen and carbon dioxide are controlled in order to keep the fruits and vegetables in harvest-like condition.  During the annual harvest season, produce goes into cold storage for used within two to three months and is locked into the 63 air tight CA (Controlled Atmosphere) rooms and held until ready for shipment worldwide into the winter, spring and summer months.  Controlled Atmosphere is one of the most advanced methods for keeping raw fruits and vegetables fresh.  The CA method is better than any other means of preservation, both in terms of time period and keeping the fresh quality. \n\nK.M. Davies utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in its closed loop refrigeration plant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in its closed loop refrigeration plant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is above the applicable threshold quantity under the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  This facility has responded to these federal regulations by developing this PSM/RMP Document, which summarizes the facility's compliance efforts.  Using a systematic approach, the process technology and design, process changes, operational, maintenance and non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans, training programs, and other elements that affect the regulated process have been considered by the facility in its evaluation.  By merging the program requirements as mandated by these two sets of regulations, K.M. Davies has attempted to achieve concurrent c"
