Union Carbide Texas City Operations (Texas City) has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets U.S. EPA Risk Management Plan (EPA RMP) and OSHAA's Process Safety Management Program (OSHA PSM) requirements.  Key elements include process hazard analysis, written operating discipline, training and operator qualification, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, compliance audits, incident investigation and an emergency response program.\r\n\r\nTexas City is a major petrochemical production facility. The products manufactured at Texas City include: Oxo alcohols and aldehydes, organic acids, acetic esters and vinyl acetate. The regulated substances handled include: vinyl acetate, propylene, ethylene, propane, and methane.\r\n\r\nThis update is being submitted to remove a process whose assets have been sold.     \r\n\r\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\nThe worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for Texas City are as follow:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical\r\nFailure of a storage tank with vinyl acetate releasing 183,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation includes design and construction codes and standards for transportation equipment are met or exceeded as well as the equipmetn insepction at the required refulatory intervals.  Foam is used by the Emergency Response Team to minimize vapor releases.  \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Toxic Chemical\r\n1) A leak develops in transfer line due to weld crack or gasket failure releasing 6,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  The storage tank is in Texas City's mechanical integrity program.  The storage tank is monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical"

The scenario is mitigated by the fact that the tanks are located in above ground earthen bunkers.  The storage tanks are in Texas City's mechanical integrity program.  The storage tanks are monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  Computer controlled emergency block valves isolate the system in the event of tank failure.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario - Flammable Chemical\r\nFailure of on the propane line resulting in a release of 47,100 lbs of propane.   This is mitigated by Texas City's mechanical integrity program and the fact that this is in a low traffic area.  Operators rounds verify that the line and its associated components continue to be in good operating condition.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\r\nTexas City is committed to operate and maintain its facility in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.  Texas City uses Dow Chemical's Global Management Systems and Emergency Response Plan to comply with applicable rules and regulations (EPA RMP and OSHA PSM) and to protect the safety of employees and public.\r\nTexas City designed its accident prevention program to comply with both EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.  Texas City incorporates the Dow Chemical Operating Discipline Management Systems (ODMS), which globalizes all Dow/Union Carbide facilities with the same environmental, health, and safety regulations.

Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Texas City/La Marque Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nTexas City has not had any chemical releases resulting in any known off-site deaths, injuries, significant damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place in the past five (5) years.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nTexas City continually strives to improve its safety-related systems.   Dow Chemical's ODMS requirements provides continuously improving  means of managing process hazards.  In addition, the implementation of Layers of Protection Analysis and the closure of any gaps determined in this analysis, using safety instrumented systems or other independent protection layers, will assure that all plant hazards are appropriately managed."
