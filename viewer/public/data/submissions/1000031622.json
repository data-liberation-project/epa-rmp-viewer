      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nArkalon Ethanol, LLC\r\n\r\nArkalon Ethanol, LLC (Arkalon) is an ethanol fuel production plant located in Liberal, Seward County, Kansas.  The plant has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nArkalon has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nArkalon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release if incidental.  In the event of an emergency, Arkalon's employees are not responsible to respond.  The facility will utilize the local fire department as first responders.  In the event of a non-incidental oil release, Arkalon has contracted with an off-site spill response contractor to assist first responders with containment and clean-up.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe facility is a stationary source and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Locally grown grains are used as the feedstock.  Denaturant is added to the fuel alcohol to make it unfit for human consumption.  Anhydrous ammonia is used onsite to assist with pH control.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\n\r\nArkalon has developed a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan with the purpose of identifying the most likely spill locations at the facility and implementing strategi"
