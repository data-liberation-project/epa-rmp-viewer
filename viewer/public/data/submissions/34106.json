      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to provide the Water Department, City of Fall River with a procedure to be followed for containment/control of massive discharge or reaction of Chlorine stock in the water treatment plant and its potentially toxic effect on employees and adjacent populations. The plan has enhanced the water departments commitment for a comprehensive written emergency response plan and an employee safety training program to mitigate the consequences of an emergency. The city of Fall River's water filtration plant produces an average of 15 million gallons per day (MGD) and provides safe drinking water to the residents of Fall River and other adjacent communities. The use of chlorine in water treatment is required to control the presence of bacteria and assist in the removal of certain dissolved chemicals from the surface water. It's use is essential to protect the public health and assure water quality. in normal use in drinking water operations chlorine is a safely contained and expertly handled substance. Chlorine is delivered in one ton cylinders and stored inside the chlorine storage room. The storage room has a maximum capacity of (7) one ton cylinders of liquified gas. Two units are on line at any one time. Empty tanks are labled and stored. To be used, the chlorine must be allowed to expand to a gaseous state and be fed into the treatment plant process in carefully measured amounts. Ths is accomplished in a chlorinator. Both the delivery system to and from the chlorinator is stressed under pressure. Leaks involving delivery systems to or from chlorinators or valves in the apparatus are not uncommon in water treatment plants. Despite the apparently sturdy construction of both cylinders, piping systems and chlorinators, it must be remembered that all components are subject to fatigue by  corrosion or continued pressure on weakened plugs or improperly prepared joints. The major chlorine emergency considered is if a tank in operation sever"

I t is theoreically possible to produc a chlorine emergency by excessive chlorination of the water. If demand exceeds the safe daily draw upon a tank (approximately 400lb./24 hr) a line freeze up may occur. Attempts to correct this situatuion may result in accidental release of chlorine. The worst case release scenario would have an offsite impact to schools,hospitals,state forest,industrial park and in circumference of 5.0 miles, which would effect 283 thousand people. The alternative case would circumference an area of 3.4 miles effectiong 95 thousand people. The main treatment plant is equipped with an atmospheric chlorine detector. This must be tested at least quarterly; the alarm will sound internally to the apparatus (located in front of the chlorinator room window) as well as on the air horn. There is a trouble light (for chlorine gas in atmosphere) on the operating console display panel. In the event of a presumed chlorine leak or chlorine alarm from the detector, the operator in charge and attendant shall investigate the leak; other personnel will go to the entrance and prepare to evacuate the building. The EPA's RMP comp. model and Aloha was used to conduct the worst case and alternative release scenarios. The water department is evaluating the system to revalve the distribution system and install excess flow valves and a total vacuum gas chlorinator/dechlorinator system using multiple vacuum regulators. There are vents near the floor in the chlorine storage room and chlorine sensors to abate the accidental releases of chlorine. The water department intents to install a sample access port in the wall of the room to take samples with a probe and meter.
