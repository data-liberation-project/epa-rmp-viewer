Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  Lilly's accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\nLTC has an Integrated Contingency Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  This plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  Additionally, individual business units at the plant maintain local emergency response procedures which focus on the actions of local personnel in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nLTC plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

The plan is available for public inspection.\r\n\r\nLTC actively supports community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Lilly Technology Center (LTC) is bounded by Raymond Street on the South, Harding Street on the West, and Morris Street on the North (plus one property to the north of Morris Street which totals 9 acres); the LTC Site is comprised of 267 total acres.

The emergency response plan spells out the hows of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  It includes response procedures that are applicable for each building/area of the plant.  Periodic tabletops, functional drills and exercises test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.  The emergency response plan has been written based upon the one-plan EPA guidance and covers all topics based on that guidance.\r\n\r\nRAVE System\r\nThe Lilly Technology Center implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996.  The RAVE system is an automated phone messaging system that can send a recorded message to everyone who lives or works within one mile of the plant site.  The system calls every number up to three times if there is no answer initially.  It also generates a report advising what phones were not answered.\r\n\r\nLilly Fire Rescue (LFR)\r\nThe Lilly Indianapolis plant sites have a trained emergency response team, Lilly Fire Rescue (LFR), made up of full time emergency staff and trained extended staff members (volunteers who have other job duties but can be called as needed). LFR is trained as an all hazard response team including Fire, Rescue, HazMat and EMS. LFR will respond to any emergency situation on the plant site when called. When Security has been notified that an emergency has occurred via telephone (555), radio, alarm or other means, Security dispatches the LFR full time staff along with the LFR extended staff who are in or near the incident area to immediately report to the incident scene to verify that an emergency exists and respond as necessary.  \r\n\r\nLFR undergoes regular training to meet Local, State, Federal and Company requirements.
