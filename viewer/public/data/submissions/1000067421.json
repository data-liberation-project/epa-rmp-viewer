The facility has policies and programs for accidental releases and spills and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe facility conforms to and has been certified to RCMS 2008; Environmental, Health, Safety and Security Management System.  RCMS stands for Responsible Care Management System offers an integrated, structured approach to improve company performance in the following key areas: community awareness and emergency response; security; distribution; employee health and safety; pollution prevention; and process and product safety. \r\n \r\nThe facility manufactures Ammonia salts and many other specialty chemical products.\r\n\r\nThe facility handles anhydrous ammonia to produce ammonia salts.  The facility may store up to 51,840 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is stored in tank that has a maximum volume of 12,000 gal. Unloading procedures require operators to fill to no greater than 80% of capacity or 9600 gallons.  Based on a density of 5.4 lb/gal at 20\u00b0F, that corresponds to a weight of 51,840 lb or 23,600 kg when converted to kilograms and rounded up to the nearest 100 kg.\r\n\r\nManagement places a strong emphasis is placed on worker safety and accident prevention.  Conscientious efforts by trained personnel ensure that the facility operates within the guidelines established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and its Process Safety Management Program.
