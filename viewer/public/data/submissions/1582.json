Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Top of Iowa Coop - Joice Ammonia Facility in Joice, IA are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Joice Fire\nDepartment, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two 30,000-, one 12,000-, and one 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our\nfacility in Joice (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 76,500 gallons (393,669 pounds) at the\nmaximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (393,669 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-\nminute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and "

The\nscenario involves the release of 7,616.42 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of\nammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTop of Iowa Coop - Joice Ammonia Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all\nprocesses (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTop of Iowa Coop - Joice Ammonia Facility maintains written operating procedures to ensure that\nactivities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various\nmodes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators\ninvolved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nTop of Iowa Coop - Joice Ammonia Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to\nensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures\nassociated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTop of Iow"
