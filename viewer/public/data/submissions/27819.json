Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Holt County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n       The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. This facility is an unmanned satellite storage plant. Employees are there only to load and unload on an irregular basis. Emergency phone numbers and contact personnel are posted.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The opereation consists of 1 18,000 gallon tank and associated piping, valves, and compressor. The maximum quantity stored is 365,000 pounds in the storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n       a. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 3.3 miles.\n\n       b. The alternate release scenario, a 2-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervene(s) or remote manuel shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 12,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .50 miles (The most likely potiental incide"

The maximum quantity released with this scenario would be 5800 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .37 miles).\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling os Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.     Five-Year Accident History\n\n       There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injures,, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injures, evacuations, property damage, or environment damage.\n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan.\n\n        The facility has:\n\n         a. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n          b. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evaluate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n        Safety is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility. With ongoing safety training and maintainance programs, and under present regulations, there are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
