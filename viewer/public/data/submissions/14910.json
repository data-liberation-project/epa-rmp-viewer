The facility is a part of the Chemical Distribution Business Unit of hci USA Distribution Companies, Inc. headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.  hci USA Distribution Companies is an advanced distribution company serving customers worldwide products, chemicals and advanced materials.  The company ranks among the top 10 chemical distribution firms in North America.  hci USA Distribution Companies has approximately 1,000 employees at more than 50 facilities in 21 states and Mexico.  hci USA Distribution Companies may be found at its Web Page: www.hollandchemical.com.  \n\nIt is a worldwide policy of hci USA Distribution Companies to design, blend and distribute its products and to handle materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers and the public from unacceptable risk.  It is also company policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations.  The facility is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and participates in the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process.  The Community Outreach and Emergency Response Plan of Responsible Distribution brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communications and cooperative emergency planning.  The facility assists with emergency planning by maintaining active membership on the Greene County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  For 15 years, the company has been a member of the Chlorine Institute, which fosters the continuous evaluation of improvements to safety and the protection of human health and the environment.\n \nThe hci Safety Program is designed to prevent fires, explosions and accidental chemical releases.  The program requires safety audits and inspection and maintenance programs as well as safety training for employees and contract workers. The emergency progra"

Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems and emergency programs.  \n\nThe hci Chemtech facility located at 2235 W. Battlefield Road in Springfield, Missouri employs 15 people from the Springfield community.  The primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute industrial chemicals.  The facility stores Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  hci USA Distribution has 50 years of experience handling Chlorine and 10 years of experience handling Sulfur Dioxide at various facilities.  The Springfield facility only stores the two products at the facility until they may be delivered to end use customers in the Springfield area.  Chlorine is widely used in the purification of drinking water, wastewater treatment and in household cleaning products.  It is also commonly used to sanitize swimming pools.  Sulfur dioxide is used in industry for the manufacture of chemicals as well as a fumigant, insecticide, preservative, fungicide and bleaching agent.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling and storage to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to that of the people in our company. \n\nThe EPA was mandated by law to define the Worst Case Scenario (WCS), as an unlikely event: the largest single storage vessel losing all of its contents in 10 minutes. The WCS also assumes that the liquid Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide immediately vaporize to gas, the safety controls do not work and there is no strong wind or moderate breeze to quickly dilute the vapors.  If the largest vessel on site of Chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "or Sulfur Dioxide lost its entire contents in 10 minutes, the resulting release would result in off-site consequences.  \n\nThe EPA calls a more likely incident, many of which will have limited off-site consequences, an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  An ARS could be a hose or small vessel leak.  For this facility the ARS for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide will also have off-site consequences in the immediate vicinity of the facility.    \n\nAt hci Chemtech several release prevention techniques are implemented in order to prevent off-site impacts.  Some examples of release prevention include investigating all unusual operations and small leaks or spills to prevent recurrence and conducting routine audits of the process.  Also, operators are trained and tested to ensure that safe operating procedures are followed at all times. \n\nhci Chemtech maintains Health, Safety and Environmental manuals, which contain company policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach and Hazard Communication among others.  The manuals also include Emergency Action Plans, Emergency Response Plans and Transportation Emergency Plans.  The facility is also in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard which requires careful reviews of the associated hazards and the necessary safeguards that must be implemented to prevent releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide from the facility in the past 5 years.  No one on-site or off-site has ever been injured from a Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide release at the facility.  Evacuation measures have never been taken due to a release.  \n\nThe facility has emergency plans, which have been coordinated with local fire departments and the Greene County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  If a chemical emergency occurred at the facility, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) would be initiated.  All emp"
