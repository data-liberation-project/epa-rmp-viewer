It is our intent not only to comply with the mandatory parts of these safety regulations, but also with the spirit of them.  We have designed this PSM/RMP program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.  We are committed to its' purpose.  We ask all employees and contractors to perform to the spirit and requirements of this program by learning how your job is an integral part the PSM/RMP program, by performing your work to the PSM/RMP Program requirements, and by making suggestions to improve the Program.\n\nThe Williams Station Power Plant is located on the Cooper River in lower Berkeley County in the Bushy Park Industrial area near Charleston.  The power plant generates 680 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in a single unit.   In addition the plant can produce 50 megawatts of electricity from two No. 2 fuel oil combustion turbines.\n\nThe Williams Station Power Plant is currently in the process of installing a SCR de-NOx system to lower its NOx emissions.  The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the NOx compounds producing nitrogen and water.  The requirement for the addition of anhydrous ammonia necessitates the storage of large quantities of the ammonia.  The RMP program is initiated when a facility stores 10,000 lb. or more of anhydrous ammonia, which the Williams Station Power Plant will be doing.  The Williams Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be stored in two tanks each having a capacity of 60,000 gallons.  Administrative procedures will limit each tank to a maximum of 51,000 gallons or 85% of tank capacity.  The two storage t"

      "SummaryText": "anks will be located inside a concrete secondary containment dike to limit the spread of liquid ammonia in case of a tank rupture.  The liquid ammonia will be delivered to the facility by tanker truck.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was identified to be a rupture of one of the storage tanks.  The result of this scenario was modeled using RMPCOMP version 1.07 and Landview 5 to determine the offsite impact.  In the analysis administrative controls (written procedures) and high level alarms will limit the maximum volume of stored anhydrous ammonia to 51,000 gallons.  In addition the tanks are located inside a concrete secondary containment dike, which limits the release rate to 13,300 lb/minute.  The model was run using a rural surrounding and predicted a radius of 6.9 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.  Landview 5 predicted the effected population to be approximately 36,300 people.\n\nThe alternate release scenario was identified to be a break in the transfer line during the unloading of a tank truck of anhydrous ammonia.  The result of this scenario was modeled using RMPCOMP version 1.07 and Landview 5 to determine the offsite impact.  In the analysis it was assumed that the operating pressure in the transfer line was 130 psi.  The release rate was estimated to be 19,700 lb. per minute for two minutes.  The model was run using a rural surrounding and predicted a radius of 2.5 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l. The effected population is estimated  to be 20 people.\n\nThe Williams Station Power Plant complies with the regulations of OSHA 1910.119 (PSM Regulations) and 40 CFR 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions Regulations - RMP).  The facility has an emergency response team on site.  As part of complying with the above regulations an Emergency Response Plan will be developed in compliance with the regulations.  Many of the components of the plan currently exist as company operating procedures.   As part of the requirement for the RMP the following"

Since the facility does not currently use or store anhydrous ammonia on site there have not been any release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response plan provides the contact name and phone number of the Berkeley County Emergency Management department (LEPC) as well as the phone numbers of the local fire department, hospital, police station and a hazardous waste response company to assist the company emergency response team on an as needed basis.  The plan also includes the following information:\n\n* Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment procedures to treat accidental human exposure to anhydrous ammonia.\n* Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n* Procedures for the use, inspection, testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment.\n* Training for employees response during an accidental spill.\n* Procedures to review and update the emergency response plan.\n* Coordination with the LEPC.\n\nSince this is a new facility regarding the use of a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) there are no planned changes to improve safety.  Prior to start-up of the system all employees will have received the appropriate training and all equipment will have been checked for proper operation.
