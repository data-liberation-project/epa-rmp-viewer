The plant provides electricity, steam and chilled water to meet current and future campus demand. The CUP contains two gas turbine generators rated at 4.75 megawatts (MW) each, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGA?s) and associated duct burners, two steam turbine generator (rated at 3.75 MW), two auxiliary boilers (each rated at 90,000 lb/hr of steam), and three diesel generators (each rated at 2 MW) for emergency electric power.\nIn order to meet the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions limit required by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 7, the two HRSGA?s and two gas turbines are equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system.  The SCR system uses ammonia, in the presence of a catalyst, to convert NOx contained in the gas turbine exhaust into nitrogen gas and water vapor.  The ammonia gas is obtained from a 29.5% solution of aqueous ammonia (aqua ammonia) which is stored in an 8,000-gallon steel underground storage tank located on UCSF property at the corner of Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way.  Aqua ammonia was chosen over anhydrous ammonia because it is significantly less hazardous.  The aqua ammonia system consists of unloading, storage, transfer, vaporization and injection systems. \n\nThe aqua ammonia unloading system will receive and transfer the contents of the delivery tanker truck from the unloading station to the underground double wall steel storage tank in the containment structure.  This tank is anchored to a concrete slab in a pit filled with pea gravel and covered by the containment building floor slab. All lighting and equipment in the building are designed as A?explosion proofA?.  Smoking and other ignition sources in the vicinity of the containment structure w"

Outside the containment structure, bollards (steel cylindrical posts filled with concrete) are placed at strategic locations to prevent traffic from impacting the containment structure. \nDeliveries to the containment structure are prescheduled between UCSF and the deliverer.  The route of the delivery truck to Parnassus Avenue have been discussed with interested UCSF neighbors and representatives from the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD), Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCA?s), and San Francisco Department of Public Health Hazardous Materials Unified Program Agency (SFDPH/HMUPA).  The delivery truck is met by a UCSF plant operator at the entrance of the containment structure.  Prior to delivery, appropriate containment structure systems are activated such as the ventilation system.   The UCSF plant operators remains at the containment structure until the unloading process is completed.   After the delivery truck reaches Parnassus Avenue, it proceeds easterly crossing Medical Center Way and entering the west end of the containment structure.  \n\nOnce the truck is inside the containment structure, the doors are lowered, hose connections are made, and the driver and UCSF operator enter the vestibule/observation room.  From the vestibule/observation room, the driver and UCSF operator initiate the unloading process (transfer by gravity) and monitor its progress until completion. The filled storage tank contains an approximate thirty-day supply of aqua ammonia; however, regular deliveries to refill the tank are planned at 30-day intervals by a 3500-gallon tanker truck.  The 30-day supply provides for potential deferrals of deliveries in inclement weather without depleting the tank supply.  Upon completion of delivery, the hose is uncoupled.  It should be noted that the hose coupling is a dry lock coupling type similar to those used in gasoline transfer hoses. The east end door is then raised and the delivery truck will drive out and p"

No backing maneuvers are required by the driver nor is the delivery truck required to drive on Medical Center Way.  The A?drive-throughA? procedure minimizes impact on both vehicle and pedestrian traffic.\nThe aqua ammonia transfer system will convey aqua ammonia as needed from the storage tank to the CUP facility via a 700 foot, 3/4 inch, double-walled underground pipe.  The aqua ammonia transfer system consists of two pumps and associated piping.  The pumps are self contained and located inside the containment structure.\nThe injection system is located at the CUP is computer controlled to minimize NOx emissions.  The system receives, vaporizes, and regulates the rate of ammonia fed into the SCR catalyst bed.  Ammonia emissions from the plant are limited by BAAQMD permit to less than 20ppm.  \n\nThe administering agency, SFDPH/HMUPA, has required UCSF to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the federal, state and local laws.  The federal law is provided under the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r); state law is specified in the California Health and Safety Code (Article 2,  Chapter 6.95, Division 20) and in the California Code of Regulations (19CCR2735-2785.1); and the local law is found in the San Francisco Municipal Health Code (Article 21, Chapter 5). \n\nThe RMP has been reviewed and evaluated by design, construction, operations, and health and safety personnel.  The prevention program has resulted in the identification of potential problems and allowed for  modifications to upgrade the facility.  UCSF is committed to maintaining the highest standards in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. \n\nThe following information is presented as required in 40CFR68.155 and 19CCR2745.3 and their subparts.\n(a)   UCSF policy requires adhere"

The safe handling of ammonia is enhanced by designing the facilities to include multiple safety devices and engineering controls, by implementing effective training programs for personnel, and by following standard operating procedures.  Both passive and active mitigation measures have been incorporated into the facility design.  \n  These measures are complemented by the presence of a robust emergency response program.  In particular, UCSF maintains an Emergency Response Team (ERT) that is knowledgeable and trained to handle hazardous material spills such as aqua ammonia.  The ERT can resolve accidental releases of a hazardous material by controlling and mitigating the release to allow a safe return to normal operations. This RMP identifies the system/process controls to further clarify the extent to which UCSF has identified and implemented the necessary measures to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the facility. The UCSF accidental release prevention program has been established to provide to the maximum extent possible a risk free environment for employees, patients, visitors and neighbors.\n(b)   The stationary source consists of an aqua ammonia unloading facility and underground storage tank located on the corner of Parnassus Avenue and Medical Center Way on the Parnassus Heights campus.  A transfer pump and piping delivers the aqua ammonia to the selective catalytic reduction unit located on the first floor of the Central Utilities Plant. The regulated substance is 29.5% aqua ammonia, an ammonia solution consisting of just over 70% water.  The regulated substance has a maximum inventory of 8,000 gallons at any given time.

The structure itself also acts as a passive mitigation device. \n  Active mitigation measures include a foam spray vapor suppressant system, fog misters, fire sprinkler system, emergency response program, and process controls.  In addition, the interior air is exhausted to the outside atmosphere through a gaseous ammonia scrubber (impregnated activated charcoal) system.\n  An ammonia leak detection system is provided to monitor the ambient air concentrations near the aqua ammonia storage tank.  In particular, gaseous ammonia detectors are located inside the containment structure, inside the catch basin, outside the structure at the vent exhausts and other selected ambient air locations, and in the interstitial annular space of the double walled storage tank and piping. Ammonia concentrations above 25 ppm will be alarmed at the control room of the ammonia facility and CUP.  \n  The CUP is staffed 24 hours a day.  A visual inspection of the exterior components of the aqua ammonia system will be performed daily by plant operation personnel.  Preventative maintenance procedures will be followed and documented.  Low and high-pressure alarms are provided to monitor the underground storage tank, transfer system, and the ammonia injection unit.  If a leak (release) is detected in the aqua ammonia system, the extent of the leak will be identified and the entire system will be rigorously inspected.
