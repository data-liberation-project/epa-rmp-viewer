Ullrich Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Austin, Texas and operated by Austin Water Utility. The location of the facility is 1000 Forest View Drive, Austin, Texas 78746 in Travis County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act 112(r). The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 288,000 pounds of chlorine in three (3) 48 ton tanks. The facility utilizes 2 cylinders \"in-service\" and 1 cylinders \"stand-by\" with automatic transfer as the cylinders become empty. The cylinders are filled, through piping from a truck delivering the chlorine as needed. The cylinders are filled, through piping from a truck delivering the ammonia as needed. The facility also stores anhydrous ammonia which is a covered process under the Risk Management Program. The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 20,600 pounds of ammonia in two (4) 1000 gallon cylinders. All cylinders are \"on-line\". The cylinders are filled, through piping from a truck delivering the ammonia as needed. Procedures require that all cylinders are filled to 85% capacity. \n\n\n\nThe facility has not had a release event associated with either covered process involving chlorine or ammonia. The facility is equipped with several mitigation systems and process controls to respond to an emergency in the event of system failure.\n\n\n\nThe Albert H. Ullrich Water Treatment Plant maintains a Risk Management Plan containing all of the elements required for a program 2 facility under the Clean Air Act section 112(r) regulations. The plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the potential hazard zone under both the Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios.

The facility operates under a current Risk Management Plan which details both the dangers associated with using chlorine and ammonia and the precautions implemented to ensure the safe use of chlorine and ammonia in the chlorination process of treating water for public consumption. Precautions include routine inspection of the equipment, proper stock of emergency response and personal protection equipment, and training of facility personnel on proper operating and emergency response procedures. The most probable type of release may occur when there is a transfer hose failure in the chlorine or ammonia lines. AWU has trained a number of workers who know how to use emergency equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and other personal protective equipment to repair such leaks. AWU hires outside contractors to inspect the equipment on a routine basis. The RMP includes current standard operating procedures for preventative maintenance on the chlorination system. \n\n\n\nAny Emergency Response is to be done in conjunction with the Austin Fire Department. All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the likely types of leaks are available on site. Further, AWU personnel audit the facility to maintain the integrity of emergency equipment, communication systems and the training status of its employees. Austin Water Utility has worked with the local emergency responders such as the Fire Department, their HazMat group, the local police departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that all parties are aware of the emergency response plan and know what to do in the event of an accidental release of chlorine or ammonia. \n\n"
