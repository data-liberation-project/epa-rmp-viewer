One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation, 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Ashdown. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine) - see topic 1.2\n \n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n \n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n4. A management system that assigns responsibility for specific elements of the program.  These elements include the preparation and maintenance of the hazards assessment, accident prevention program (including OSHA PSM), and emergency response plan; RMPlan preparation, submittal"

This system ensures that Georgia-Pacific Ashdown employees work as a responsible and accountable team, ensuring that the Mill operates in a safe and reliable manner, protecting workers, the community, and the environment.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at G-P/Ashdown. In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\nG-P/Ashdown minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nG-P/Ashdown limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to reduce the potential for injuries and/or environmental damage to occur in the event of a release. \n\nThe safety program at G-P/Ashdown consists of a number of elements, of which, only some are required by the RMP Rule. This RMP is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nG-P/Ashdown is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accident"

These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment. G-P/Ashdown provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Pulp and Paper /Ashdown Operations.\n\n\n1.2 Georgia-Pacific Ashdown Operations and Our Regulated Substances\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Ashdown Operations is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (C102) for the use of bleaching pulp. The facility stores and transfers chlorine for use in bleaching pulp, in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP Rule. Chlorine usage and storage will be eliminated by the implementation of the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) regulations on or before April, 2001.  The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide and the Chlorine System, which includes the 90 ton railcar and distribution system for the Bleach Plant, are considered RMP covered processes in Program Level 3.\n\n\n1.3 Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nG-P/Ashdown performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of reg"

The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like G-P/Ashdown and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the end- point distance). The various health effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects could be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Ashdown Operations. These requirements include:\n\n           one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario  representing chlorine)\n           one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n \n The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Ashdown Operations.\n \n \n 1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process- Chlorine (C12) Systems and the Chlorine Dioxide (C102)"

The RMP Rule mandates, that for the worst-case scenario, the analysis assumes loss of the largest storage vessel in ten minutes. The released chlorine would evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA Lookup Table approach, is greater than 25 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 129,750 people live within this distance from the facility; several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., several industrial facilities, several public and private elementary schools and high schools, several nursing homes, several churches, several recreation parks). \n \n The alternative release scenario for chlorine is the rupture of the chlorine unloading hose, releasing 212 pounds per minute for 30 minutes before it could be isolated. The released chlorine will evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA Lookup Table approach, is 2.1 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 1,300 people live within this distance from the ruptured line. Several public receptors are also located within this distance including, the Ashdown Junior and Senior High Schools, the Pleasant Manor Nursing Home, Little River Memorial Hospital, Little River Nursing Home, Ashdown City Park, and several local churches and public shopping parking lots. There are also several environmental receptors.\n \n The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide solution line located at the discharge side of the C102 transfer pumps' header.

Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System and the Chlorine System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3-prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n \n \n 1.4.1 The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Georgia-Pacific Ashdown Operations Program Level 3 prevention program that addresses the EPA RMP Rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine System and Chlorine Dioxide Solution Systems.\n \n 1.
