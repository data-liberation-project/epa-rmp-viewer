THE PLANT OCCUPIES AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE ACRES IN THE BAYPORT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. THE PROPERTY IS BORDERED ON ALL SIDES BY OPEN LAND.  FACILITIES IN THE NEAR VICINITY OF THE AERIFORM PLANT INCLUDE DUPONT TO THE WEST, CELANESE CORPORATION TO THE NORTH, HOYER TO THE SOUTH AND BEELINE TO THE EAST.  THE AERIFORM PLANT IS BOUNDED ON ALL SIDES WITH A 6 FOOT CHAIN LINK FENCE WHICH IS TOPPED WITH 3 STRANDS OF BARBED WIRE.  THE  MAIN ENTRANCE GATE AND THE SECONDARY GATE ARE ON THE EAST SIDE WHERE ACCESS IS VIA CHEMICAL ROAD.\n\nTHE PRIMARY BUSINESS OF THE AERIFORM PLANT IS FILLING AND DISTRIBUTION OF HIGH PRESSURE CYLINDERS FOR INDUSTRIAL GASES, MEDICAL GASES, AND SPECIALTY GASES, INCLUDING CALIBRATION GASES.  ANNUAL GAS USAGE VARIES DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMERS.  EQUIPMENT OPERATED INCLUDES CRYOGENIC STORAGE TANKS, BULK LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS STORAGE VESSELS, HIGH PRESSURE STORAGE TUBES BANKS FOR VARIOUS COMPRESSED GASES AND VARIOUS PUMPS, COMPRESSORS AND VAPORIZORS.  THE PASADENA PLANT EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY 29 EMPLOYEES AND WAS PURCHASED BY AERIFORM IN THE SUMMER OF 1996.  THE AERIFORM PASADENA PLANT IS CURRENTLY ISO 9002 CERTIFIED AND HAS BEEN CERITFIED SINCE 1994.\n\nTHE PASADENA PLANT UTILIZES LIQUID PUMPS  TO FILL THE PROPANE AND OTHER LP-GASES INTO CYLINDERS.  RAW MATERIALS IN THE  LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES ARE DELIVERED BY TRUCK INTO THE PLANT.  LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES ARE PUMPED FROM BULK TANKS IN TO CYLINDERS.  ALL CYLINDERS ARE FILLED BY WEIGHT ON SCALES CALIBRATED EVERY 6 MONTHS AND PRIOR TO USE. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS ARE INPLACE TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION OF  EQUIPMENT.  \n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TOTAL RELEASE OF 2400 GALLONS OF PROPANE INTO A VAPOR CLOUD.  RESULTING IN A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION WITH A ESTIMATED DISTANCE OF 0.2 OF A MILE TO THE ENDPOINT.  AT THAT POINT THERE WOULD BE AN OVERPRESSURIZATION LEVEL OF ONE POUN"

PNEUMATICALLY ACTUATED EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVES ARE UTILIZED DURING THE TRANSFER OF PRODUCT FROM THE LIQUID TANKER TO THE STORAGE VESSELS.  THE AREA UTILIZED TO FILL THE CYLINDERS IS EQUIPPED WITH EXPLOSION PROOF FIXTURES AND SWITCHES.  EXPLOSION PROOF EXHAUST FANS ARE UTILIZED WHEN FILLING CYLINDERS.  SAFETY RELIEF VALVES ARE PLACED WERE NEEDED TO PREVENT OVERPRESSURIZATION OF THE STORAGE VESSEL AND ARE CHECKED ANNUALLY.  EXCESS FLOW VALVES AND BACK PRESSURE CHECK VALVES ARE USED ON EVERY VESSEL TO PREVENT A UNEXPECTED RELEASE OF PRODUCT.\n\nTHE AERIFORM CORPORATON COMPLIES WITH ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS ENFORCED BY THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, AND ANY OTHER STATE OR LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
