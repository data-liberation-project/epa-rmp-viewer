The prevention program at this facility consists of seven (7) elements (safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation).\nUp to 60 times per year 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank.",

Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Action Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for wholesale to member cooperatives.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used for manufacturing 10-34-0 fertilizer.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 130,000 pounds stored in one (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  This facility is loaded by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.    \n\nUp to 60 times per year 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized abovegrou"

The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 130,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.12 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the storage tank is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from a delivery truck to the storage tank.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.56 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Sections 8 through 19 briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process. \n\n1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed"

Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n14) Pre-Startup Review:  When modification to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and, training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed.\n\n15) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.
