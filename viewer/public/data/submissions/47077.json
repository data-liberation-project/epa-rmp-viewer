The company has developed and implemented a process safety management plan (\u00bfPSM\u00bf/29CFR 1910.119) and a risk management plan (\u00bfRMP\u00bf) pursuant to US EPA regulation 40 CFR 68 under the Clean Air Act.  Facility is presently updating its RMP prior to its five\u00bfyear anniversary.  The PSM written program incorporates Pennant Foods\u00bf emergency response plan (ERP) and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.  The emergency action plan (EAP) is updated periodically to incorporate modification and changes to the plant.  Training on implementation of the EAP is given to all the employees on an annual basis.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPennant Foods, located in Northlake, Illinois and a subsidiary of Fresh Start Bakeries, is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing a variety of gourmet baked products to the food service industry.  Pennant Foods employs 300 people and manufactures products such as muffins, croissant rolls, Danish pastries and cinnamon rolls. The principal raw materials used at the facility are wheat flour and sugar.  For refrigeration and cooling, the company operates a mechanical refrigeration system charged with anhydrous ammonia.  The quantity of ammonia in the refrigeration system has increased from 10,000 lbs to 21,000 lbs due to recent expansion of the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nFor the ammonia system, Pennant Foods followed the ANSI/IIAR Standard and manufac"

Pennant Foods has implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program that is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur. The Company backs up its commitment to safety by developing and implementing procedures for critical operations and communicating hazards of the process and chemicals used through Hazard Communication Programs.  The Company has ongoing safety programs implemented with the help and participation of specialized consultants.  All safety programs are implemented under the direct supervision of senior management personnel.  Pursuant to the Risk Management Plan regulation and Process Safety Management standard, Pennant Foods has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect the employees and surrounding community from accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The facility used a \u00bfWhat-If\u00bf technique for process hazard analysis (PHA).  Further, the implementation of the PSM program includes education in the hazards of ammonia, a preventive maintenance program for the ammonia system, program for pre-startup safety reviews and management of change.  The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as hot working procedures) and contactor safety training.\n\nTo accomplish the company\u00bfs goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  A Safety Committee implements the Plant Safety Program. The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance; eliminate human suffering, losses and property damage resulting from injuries and accidents. \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, there was one reportable accident of ammonia being released. This release occurred"

      "SummaryText": "on June 27, 2005.  Pennant Foods was installing a new product line and had contracted the installation of the refrigeration equipment to an independent company.  The company selected to perform the work was considered highly reputable with many years of experience in the refrigeration industry.  However, upon investigation, it was discovered that the refrigeration contractor did not follow proper PSM procedures of equipment testing as mandated by Pennant Foods prior to start up of a newly installed equipment.  This resulted in release of 3,000 lbs of ammonia over 6 hours duration.  The release occurred from two valves and a pressure switch connected to refrigeration equipment.\n\nThe area where the release occurred was isolated, the operator immediately shut down the refrigeration system and the Emergency Action Plan was implemented with the involvement of the local fire department.  All the plant personnel were safely evacuated.  No evacuation of the surrounding community was deemed necessary, however as a precautionary measure one neighboring facility to North was evacuated.  There were no injuries or exposures reported associated with this incident.  As a result of the incident investigation and corrective action recommendations, Pennant Foods retained an independent PSM Consultant and extensively reviewed all elements of PSM with emphasis on Management of Change Procedures and Contractor Safety Procedures. Company personnel involved in PSM implementation have been retrained. Revised Contractor Safety Procedures are in place and include reviews of contractor performance and the inclusion of safety performance and programs in selecting contractors for work on or adjacent to the ammonia process.\n\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario:\n\nThe Pennant Foods facility is located in a commercial and industrial zoned section of the City of Northlake. The expressways I-294 and I-290 are located on the west side of the facility at close proximity"

      "SummaryText": ". The setting is urban.\n\nThe worst case scenario is considered to be a rupture of the high pressure receiver, which contains most of the ammonia in the system at any given time.  It is contemplated that a rupture such as this would cause loss of all the ammonia in the receiver (10,000 lbs.) over a period of 10 minutes, being released at a constant rate.  The toxic endpoint is taken to be an ERPG-2 of 0.14 mg/1 and was estimated to be 1.2 miles from the source.  The consequences are modeled in atmospheric stability category F, at a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The modeling has been developed by using EPA\u00bfS \u00bfRMP Comp\u00bf Software. However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a tank rupture such as this, there will be offsite impact of the toxic chemical release.  The released ammonia fumes will travel in the direction of the wind.  The distance of travel will depend on the prevailing weather conditions.  Ammonia concentration in the air will be significant so as to warrant the evacuation of surrounding population.  In this case, the company will implement the Emergency Action Plan.\n\nIn a less severe but most likely situation - referred to as a alternative scenario, a release can occur due to gasket rupture, pump seal leak, relief valve leak or broken hose equivalent; this would go through an orifice, which has a diameter of \u00bc to \u00bd inch.  A typical rate of release would be 7.5 lbs/minute and typical weather condition would be Atmospheric Stability Category D with a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour.  The toxic end point of 500 feet was derived from the EPA\u00bfS RMP Comp Software as a typical urban site and the smallest rate of release with minimal off-site impact.

      "SummaryText": "e mitigation to a release of 100 lbs/minute is considered to be the building housing the refrigeration equipment.  Such a release could be contained until automatic and manual shutoff systems could be activated.  Responders could further mitigate the release by absorption in water from a fire hose, and neutralizing the resulting mixture with an acidic media or chemical.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPennant Foods has updated its emergency response program in August, 2005 to include response procedures addressing the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The update of the plan was done to include modifications to the building due to addition of a new product line.  As required, various scenarios have been analyzed.  Company personnel are trained to respond to minor releases and minor repair/maintenance problems.  However, in the event of a release having offsite impact, the facility will work with a HAZMAT team of the Northlake Fire Department to control the emergency and protect the surrounding community.  Notification will be done through the local police and fire department in case evacuation becomes necessary.  The facility has identified public receptors in the area of potential impact and this information is included in the Emergency Action Plan.  A copy of the emergency action plan will be available with the Northlake Fire Department."
