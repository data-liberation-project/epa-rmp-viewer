Possible causes of the worst case release or the probability that such a release might occur, are not considered.\n\nThe worst case release scenario that Sentry Industries selected was a complete failure of the railcar and the release of 90 tons of chlorine in a 10-minute time frame.  This release could potentially effect the community up to  14 miles. An alternative (most likely) release scenario would be up to a 10 pound release from a gasket, valve or flange leak and could effect the community up to .1 miles. This alternate scenario is based on the only two leaks experienced within the last five years.\n\nSentry Industries has taken the following steps to ensure our safe handling of chlorine in the community:\n\n7 All manufacturing processes are Y2K compliant.\n7 Only purchase chlorine in railcars from suppliers that conform to all Federal safety requirements for railcars and follow the Chlorine Institute recommendation for railcar loading and maintenance.\n7 System was designed per industry codes.\n7 Have procedures in place for the safe movement of railcars in and out of our secure railcar siding.\n7 Equipment checks and preventative maintenance program in place.\n7 Only trained personnel are allowed to receive, connect and disconnect chlorine railcars.\n7 Written Standard Operating Procedures for operators to follow.\n7 State of the art valve closure system to close the valves on the railcar and the piping system in case of railcar movement, detection of chlorine released to the atmosphere, safety equipment failure, power failure and manual shut down.  \n7 Redundant safety systems.\n7 Chlorine gas monitor system that will warn plant personnel and shut the railcar car valves if it detects as little as 1 ppm chlorine released to the atmosphere.\n7 Annual auditing of procedures and operations.\n7 A chlorine scrubber system to pull a vacuum on hoses and piping systems.\n7 Comply with OSHA Process Safety Management rule and EPA's Risk"

      "SummaryText": "Management Plan.\n7 Work with all state and local agencies to improve not only our safety, but also the industries safety commitment overall.\n\nIn the past five years we have had two accidental release of chlorine.\n  \n7 Approximately 2 pounds of chlorine was released on 8/16/95 from a hose connection that leaked from a faulty connection when the railcar was opened.  No one on site or off site was injured.  A business directly behind our facility evacuated 4 to 6 persons from an outside work area as a precautionary measure.  This incident was investigated and a scrubber system and automatic valve closure system was installed as a result.\n\n7 Between 2 and 4 pounds of chlorine was released on 4-29-99 from a flange under a safety  expansion chamber.  All safety systems worked, the railcar was shut down and a vacuum was pulled on the piping system.  From the area effected and the physical conditions observed, the amount of the release was approximately 2 to 4 pounds but could not be determined exactly.  This release was reported as a release between 2 and 10 pounds.  As of this writing this release was still under investigation.   Preliminary corrective actions have been to inspect all flanges in the piping system, inspect all gaskets and flanges in inventory, and send the flange, gasket, and disc holder to the vender/manufacture for inspection.
