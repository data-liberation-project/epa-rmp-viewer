The County's proactive approach to implementing new policies for emergency management and accidental release prevention has been a keystone to their success over the years.  The gaseous chlorine system (Process) at the Tropical Farms WTP & WWTP has not had an accidental release since the plant went into service in 1996.  The current prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Tropical Farms WTP & WWTP is located in Stuart, FL and utilizes chlorine gas process via vacuum injection for the disinfection of water and wastewater.  The Process is maintained in an enclosed structure.  The equipment in the Process is maintained per the maintenance procedures.  The gaseous chlorine is stored at the Process area in one-ton cylinders (2,000 pounds per cylinder).  The gaseous chlorine is liquefied under pressure when full.  The Process can have a maximum of 10 full cylinders on-site at one time.\n\n\n\nThe County and its employees have an impeccable performance history regarding the handling, storing, maintenance and operation of gaseous chlorine.  The Tropical Farms WTP & WWTP is staffed by 5 full time employees.  The operational staff is state certified and is trained to safely handle, maintain, and operate the Process so that they comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The Process is designed by making use of the most recent technologies and Process specific design codes and standards.  The emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community emergency re"

      "SummaryText": "sponse officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The operational staff has been trained to react to a release according to these response plans.\n\n\n\nA gaseous chlorination system used within the Tropical Farms WTP & WWTP has yielded many benefits, including the prevention of water borne diseases.  While the treatment process has some risks associated with its use, the County has an exceptional record regarding its history of accidents, yet remains observant regarding the attention to safety of the Process.  The County has supported this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general vicinity of the Tropical Farms WTP & WWTP of the risks associated with accidental gaseous chlorine releases since its inception.  The County realizes that the Process can potential become a public health and environmental risk if an accidental release were to occur.  With this possibility in mind, the County has initiated plans to convert the gaseous chlorine system to a sodium hypochlorite system.  The liquid chlorination system will eliminate the risk of a gaseous release, which could affect public health and environment, due to the fact that the chlorine is in liquid form and not in gaseous form.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the information presented in this summary, please contact the offices of Martin County Utilities & Solid Waste Department, 2378 S.E. Ocean Blvd, Stuart, Florida 34996, (772)-221-1442.\n\n"
