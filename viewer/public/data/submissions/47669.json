      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the Little Rock Wastewater (LRW) policy to operate Adams Field Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the chlorine system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  Safe operation depends on proper storage of chlorine, proper handling of the chlorination system, and inherent safety features in the design of the chlorination system.  Safety in storage and handling is achieved through the use of safe handling procedures and training of personnel.  \nThe policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Adams Field WWTP.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Little Rock Fire Department. \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities:  The primary activity is municipal wastewater treatment.  The Adams Field WWTP originally was constructed in 1936 and has a current capacity of 24 million gallons per day (mgd).  The sludge from the facility is pumped to the Fourche Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) as a solution.\n\nUse of Regulated Substances:  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling of biosolids settling in the clarification process.\nSubstance Handled or Stored:  Chlorine:  \nTotal Amount Stored:  18 one-ton containers, equivalent to 41,400 pounds.\n\nHazard Assessment\nThe LRW's Adams Field WWTP has conducted a Hazard Assessment and Off-site Consequence Analysis for the chlorination process in accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program Rule. The results of this Hazard Assessment have been appropriately communicated with the local emergency response agencies.\n\nAccidental Releas"

      "SummaryText": "e Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe LRW's Adams Field WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as of administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What If\" analysis and the hazard review has been recently updated according to the requirements of the standard utilizing the \"What If/Checklist\" methodology.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe LRW's Adams Field WWTP has never had a release of chlorine resulting in offsite injury or dispersion, or in onsite injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe LRW's Adams Field WWTP has an Emergency Response Program, which coordinates response efforts with the Little Rock Fire Department's HAZMAT team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the LRW's Adams Field WWTP has the necessary equipment and operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system.  The following recommendations for improving the safety of the chlorination process were made:\n1. Prepare a comprehensive chlorine emergency response and training program.\n2. Implement a chlorine shipment quality assurance program."
