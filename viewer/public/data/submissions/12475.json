A primary aspect of this commitment is the Keynes Bros., Inc. system to help ensure the safe operation of the Flour Chlorination Process. This commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention in the operation and maintenance of  processes, as well as in the  extensive training of operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Keynes Bros., Inc. has procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment. Keynes Bros., Inc. emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases. An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee any response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Keynes Bros., Inc. established a management system headed by William W. Keynes, Jr. to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n2.0     REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nKeynes Bros., Inc., located in Logan, Ohio, is primarily involved in Flour Milling. Keynes Bros., Inc. utilizes Chlorine which is a regulated substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. The following is a table which lists the Keynes Bros., Inc. RMP covered processes and the associated Regulated Substances with maximum quantities:\n\n     Process Description       Program Level        Regulated Substance        Pro"

Chlorine was evaluated for a possible worst-case scenario and two (2) alternate scenarios. The alternate release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence. By identifying these potential releases, Keynes Bros., Inc. has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment because of an accidental release. This point is called the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances less than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n     3.1 Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n          The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is the catastrophic failure of all six (6) one-ton cylinders and the release of 12,000 lbs. Of Chlorine in a 10-minute period.  No credit for administrative controls, passive mitigation or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for this WCS is 3.32 miles. U.S. Census records indicate that approximately 6500 people live within this distance from the point of the release; several public receptors (e.g., schools, residences, etc.) are located within the distance; environmental receptors within this distance is the Hocking Hills.\n\n         An alternative release scenario (ARS) for Chlorine is the release of the entire contents of one (1) one-ton cylinder at the rate"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for this ARS is 0.30 mile. U.S. Census records indicate that approximately 1000 people live within this distance; several public receptors (e.g., residences and commercial buildings)) are within the distance; no environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\n        A second alternative scenario for Chlorine is the release of the entire contents of one (1) one-ton cylinder at a rate of 110 lbs/min due to the failure of a valve or of piping.  This scenario takes into account the passive mitigation of the building, thus reducing the release rate of 200 lbs/min by 45% (200 x 0.55 = 110).  The stability class is assumed to be D and the wind speed is assumed to be 3 m/sec.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm is 0.20 mile for this ARS.   500 people live within this distance.  Residences and commercial buildings are located within this distance.  No environmental receptors are located within this distance. \n\n     3.2   Hazard Assessment - Flammable\n\n                 Not Applicable\n\n4.0     ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\nThe Keynes Bros., Inc.
