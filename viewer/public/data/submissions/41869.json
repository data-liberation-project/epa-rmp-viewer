      "SummaryText": "\nThe company has coordinated its Risk Management Plan with the Sumter County LEPC. The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigerous mechanical mixing of polyols with water, catalyst and surfactants. The resultant polmeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide formed in the reaction between water and TDI. The facility stores and uses quantities of 2,4 toluene diisocyanate and 2,6 toluene dissocyanate in excess of the threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR 68.115, wich is 10,000 pounds. The 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate are stored as a 80/20 mixture in storage tanks as follows: Two 10,000 gallon storage tanks. The action taken by this facility to prevent accidental releases includes the following: periodic inspection of all lines, pumps, valves for leaks, corrosion, operational failures. Manual inspection of tank levels prior to loading to ensure adequate space is available. Unloading operations are not left unattended. Storage tanks are indoors to reduce corrosion and protect from accidental rupturing. Storage tanks are all diked with concrete floors. There have been no accidental releases of TDI from this facility in the past 5 years that have caused on site or off site impacts.The local LEPC has been informed of the dangers associated with TDI and has been provided with sufficient information to enable them to deal with a release accident."
