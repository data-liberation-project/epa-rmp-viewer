It is our goal to achieve and sustain \" Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Tiverton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nTiverton Power is a combined cycle power plant. The regulated substance handled here is Anhydrous Ammonia used as a refrigerant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency. Approximately 57,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the \"Chiller System\".\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the Chiller System. This facility is located in a rural area and there may be off-site consequences in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Tiverton Power are to comply with EPA's accidental prevention rule, OSHA's process safety management rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Each system and equipment at Tiverton Power is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the afformentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\nTiverton Power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use.\n\nThe emergency response program at Tiverton Power is to contact the Tiverton Fire Department. It is our policy to request the fire department's response to an emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familiar with our systems and materials.\n\nCurrently there are no plans to revise existing safety programs being administered at Tiverton Power."
