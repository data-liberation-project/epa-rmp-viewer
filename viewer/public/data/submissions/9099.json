At the pump stations, raw wastewater from the Jefferson Interceptor, Oakwood Interceptor and North Interceptor-East Arm receive coarse screening and grit removal and is then pumped to the primary tanks.  Ferrous chloride is added to the raw wastewater for phosphorous removal.  The wastewater is pumped from the Intermediate Lift Station to the secondary treatment facilities where  treatment is provided by the activated sludge method.  Following final clarification, the wastewater is disinfected by the addition of chlorine and discharged to the Detroit River.  Treated wastewater can be discharged to the Rouge River if hydraulically or structurally necessary. The primary solids and secondary activated solids are gravity thickened and dewatered by either centrifuge or belt filter presses.  The main sludge disposal method is by incineration and landfill of the ash.  Excess sludge is lime stabilized and landfilled.\n\n\tThe primary components of the chlorination process are four (4) 90 ton rail cars, two (2) steam vaporizers, nine (9) hot water evaporators, one (1) auxiliary steam boiler, two (2) hot water circulation pumps, one (1) gas fired hot water heater, eleven  (11) chlorinators, one (1) chlorine contact chamber, and the caustic soda air wash system. The Plant keeps one spare chlorine tank car as a back up unit.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and The Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n\tThe gas dispersion model ALOHA ( Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres ) which is recommended by the EPA has been employed by our facility to conduct the worst case and alternative case scenarios. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  \n\n\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario involves the release of 90 tons of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.

The training consists of reviewing the chlorination manual and actual hands-on field operation of the equipment.  Leak detection and equipment isolation procedures are also included in this training.\n\n\tThe preventive maintenance program consists of equipment calibration and replacement of components to maintain process performance.  The chlorine monitoring devices are calibrated monthly and after each alarm event.  Rupture disc replacement is performed annually to prevent premature chlorine releases caused by eroded or fatigued disks.  A total inspection and/or replacement of the process piping are performed at 5 year intervals.  \n\n5.\tThe five -year accident history.\n\n\tWe have had 13 accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years (from June 1994 to June 1999) and they were all small and  contained within the chlorination building.

Flashing red lights are provided at all the entrances to the chlorine building and at the junction chamber to indicate the presence of chlorine.\n\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tDWWTP has planned several modifications to the chlorine facility such as relocation of the current facility and installation of new equipment to improve the overall safety of the chlorination process. HAZMAT training will be provided to more plant personnel to be the part of the emergency response program.

As specified in ' 68.155, the owner or operator must provide an executive summary that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Plan. At Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant (DWWTP), chlorine is the only regulated substance that is being handled above the EPA threshold of 2,500 lbs. The following elements describe the Risk Management Plan as per ' 68.155, for the Chlorination Process at the Detroit Wastewater treatment Plant.\n\n1.\tThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\n\tDetroit Water and Sewerage Department, under which DWWTP is being operated, is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The chlorination process in Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant  has been designed and constructed per the applicable codes and engineering standards.  Currently, the process is working and meets the good engineering practices.  Also, a preventive maintenance program consisting of equipment calibration and replacement of components to maintain process performance has been implemented.  Chlorine tank car inspection, cleaning,  repair, interior system tests and relief valve tests  are made by the supplier.  \n\n\tAt DWWTP, a set of nine (9) detectors are placed throughout the roof of the administration building and at the junction chamber.  Their function is to warn of chlorine gas in the air and to activate the automatic shut off mechanism of the air intake to the various parts of the building affected.  These detectors are set to detect one part per million (1 ppm) chlorine gas by volume in air; activate an alarm and shut off heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems at 5 ppm of con"

Two of these sensors have an activation level of 1 ppm and the third one has the activation level of 3 ppm of chlorine gas.  When the chlorine gas content exceeds the activation level, visual and audible alarms are triggered.\n\n\tThe caustic soda air wash system chemically neutralizes chlorine from a leak inside the chlorination building before the gas escapes to the outside atmosphere.\n\n\tFlashing red lights are provided at all the entrances to the chlorination building.  This is to alert the area personnel that  there is or was a leak inside the building. Flashing red light at the Junction Chamber is a signal that indicates that there is or was chlorine in the vicinity of Chlorine Chamber.  \n\n\tDetroit Wastewater Treatment Plant has an emergency response plan. We are in the process of training personnel to form an emergency response team.  The fire department will be notified for assistance.  The plant supervisor will also notify the police to be prepared for an evacuation of the neighboring residents if the need occurs. Other agencies to be notified in the event of an accidental release of chlorine are City of Detroit Local Emergency Planning Committee ( LEPC ), Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Pollution Emergency Alert System, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The National Response Center (NRC) which will notify the appropriate federal agencies, Ontario Ministry of Environment, Canada Consulate General Office, and Detroit Water and Sewerage Department's Systems Control Division.\n\n2.\tStationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\tDetroit Wastewater Treatment Plant provides secondary treatment for flows up to 930 MGD.
