This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n-A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n-An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n-A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n-An overview of our emergency response program\n-An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occuring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces a number of products that include propylene oxide (PO), styrene monomer (SM), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), polyether polyols, and an assortment of products from the butanediol unit, including allyl alcohol.  A variety of chemicals and processes are used to produce these products.  There are two PO/SM units, one MTBE unit, one Polyols unit, and one BDO unit on site.  These units/processes use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nTOXICS\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO): Approximately 35.2 million lbs are on-site based on storage, production, and use.  PO is the major product of the facility and is also a"

AA is a product produced in the BDO Unit.\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO):    Approximately 1.54 millions lbs are stored and used on-site.  EO is a primary feedstock of the Polyols Unit.\n\nFLAMMABLES\n\nPropylene:  Approximately 950,000 lbs are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is the primary feedstock for both PO Units.\n\nPropane:  Approximately 75,000 lbs are stored and used on-site.  Propane is a chemical used in the production of PO.\n\nMethylamine:  Approximately 740,000 lbs are stored and used on-site.  The methylamine is stored in an aqueous solution that is approximately 40% MA and 60% water.  MA is a feedstock in the Butanediols Unit.\n\nEthylene:  Approximately 71,000 lbs are contained in a pipeline and used as a primary feedstock in the production of ethylbenzene in both PO/SM Units.\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 414,000 lbs are contained in a surge drum in the MTBE Unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nREGULATED TOXIC CHEMICALS\n\nWorst-case Scenario - Propylene Oxide\n\nThe worst case scenario for propylene oxide (PO) assumes the complete rupture of the largest PO storage tank releasing 17,250,000 pounds of liquid PO into a containment dike, leading to a vapor cloud release.  This release would impact off-sit"

This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail including the emergency shutdown.  The total release would be 20,200 pounds of PO, the vapor could would extend past the fence line and impact neighbors closest to the fence line.\n\nCredit was not taken for safety systems in place that would minimize the release.  These systems include:\n\n-Emergency shutdown switches\n-Drains that lead to a chemical sump\n-Water spray/sprinkler system\n-Deluge system\n-Remote isolation valves\n-Emergency Team response\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Allyl Alcohol\n\nThe alternative release scenario for allyl alcohol (AA) assumes failure of a 6\" loading hose or loading arm.  This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail including the emergency shutdown.

The overpressure would extend past the fence line and impact neighbors closest to the fence line.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables assumes a flange separation on a 12\" propylene recycle line.  This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail.  The total release would be approximately 163,000 pounds of propylene, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The overpressure would be contained on-site, but would have an impact on a cogeneration facility owned by a different company and located on-site.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess H"
