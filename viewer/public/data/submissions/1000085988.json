Mockingbird Central Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic Mockingbird Central Facility release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Mockingbird Central Facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Mockingbird Central Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Mockingbird Central Facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility located: Section 34, Block 58, Township 1, T&P Railroad Company Survey, Culberson County, Texas, operates a liquid recovery process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquids) from natural gas. The Mockingbird Central Facility has regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Mockingbird Central Facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) from a catastrophic vessel failure involving the inventory of the inlet slug catcher natural gas and natural gas liquids. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.3 miles and there are no offsite receptors. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was considered in evaluating this WCS.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Mockingbird Central Facility. Because processes at the Mockingbird Central Facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Healt"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Mockingbird Central Facility's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented on the China Draw PSM SharePoint that is maintained at the Loving Field Office and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the Mockingbird Central Facility has several initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include weekly team meetings to promote both process and personal safety. These meetings include members from various areas of the Mockingbird Central Facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, safety, and plant management.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Delaware Process Safety Coordinator for the Mockingbird Central Facility is assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Mockingbird Central Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the China Draw PSM SharePoint. The Mockingbird Central Facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility primarily uses the HAZOP/LOPA technique to perform these evaluations.

New employees receive basic training in Mockingbird Central Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors\r\nThe Mockingbird Central Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Mockingbird Central Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Mockingbird Central Facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
