This company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place.  Our owners, managers and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOur plant consists of one 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank and when filled to 85% capacity will hold approximately 140,250 pounds.  With the addition of 17 nurse tanks with a capacity of 79,475 pounds makes the company's total capacity of 219,725 pounds.\n\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program.  More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis company maintains and operates their anhydrous ammonia plant in strict accordance with all state and local authorities.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Changes or improvements in the facility's equipment will be acted upon imediately following the enforcement agency's request, or as found to be necessary by our maintenence staff.\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and the employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank loading operations.\n\nWith the above-men"
