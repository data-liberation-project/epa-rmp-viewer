The Wallula mill handles one or more regulated substances listed in Appendix A of Part 68.\n\n \n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\n\n\nBoise Cascade owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Wallula Washington, which is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The regulated substances handled by this facility is chlorine dioxide, which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\n\n\nThe Wallula mill uses Kraft and neutral sulfite semi-chemical (NSSC) pulping processes to produce pulp and paper from wood chips. Chlorine Dioxide is regulated under the Risk Management Program, and used at the mill to bleach the Kraft pulp.  Paper, the final product of the mill, is made from both bleached and unbleached pulp.\n\n\n\nChlorine Dioxide is generated at the mill using the R-8 generation process. Chlorine Dioxide is stored in an aqueous solution in two 272,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide that is stored in the tanks is 52,220 pounds.\n\n\n\nBoise Cascade also stores the following listed chemicals on-site, in quantities below the RMP thresholds for each process: aqueous ammonia, propane, hydrochloric acid, acetylene, and chlorine for process water treatment.\n\n\n\n3.0 Accidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nBoise Cascade takes a systematic , proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Wallula mill's management systems, which cover the chlorine dioxide process, address each of the following key features of "

RMP Management System\n\n\n\nA management system was established to identify responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP is required to be updated every five years, or any time a covered process modification involves Process Hazard Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program development, implementation, and maintenance is the responsibility of the following team members:\n\n\n\nKevin Scott, RMP Manager, Environmental Department\n\nKen Arnold, Hazmat Assessment Coordinator, Power and Recovery\n\nKris Lagers, Emergency Response Coordinator, Power and Recovery Department\n\nAmy Cruz, Communications Coordinator, Public Affairs Department\n\nKen Arnold, Prevention Program Coordinator, Power and Recovery Department\n\n\n\nThe RMP Manager has the responsibility for the administration of the program.\n\n\n\n2. Process/Chemical Safety Information\n\n\n\nA comprehensive chemical data base has been assembled to include regulatory reporting, action thresholds, health hazard and chemical exposure limitations, and list the physical properties of regulated substance.  This information was compiled from numerous sources for easy access by a reader seeking data on these substances.\n\n\n\nProcess safety information was carefully assembled for the chlorine dioxide processes. Process specifications on each process are collected in one area for easy reference.  Detailed specifications on such items as maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the processes are on file at the mill.\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nA hazard analysis was conducted for each of the covered processes.  The hazard analysis team was made up of representatives from plant management, maintenance experts, process and project engineers, and process operating personnel.

Process changes that are determined to be replacement in kind are allowed without completing a full management of change procedure.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change procedure to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Pre-startup Review\n\n\n\nBoise Cascade performs a safety review of a new or modified process at the Wallula facility before it is activated for operation to ensure the process is safe to operate.  To ensure that the appropriate issues have been addressed, a pre-startup review checklist is complete to document the review.\n\n\n\n9. Internal Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the Accident Prevention Program.  Boise Cascade assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The audit results are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n10.   Incident Investigations\n\n\n\nAll incidents are investigated at the Wallula mill that could have resulted in an injury to personnel, the public , or the environment to ensure that similar situations can be prevented.  Boise Cascade trains employees to recognize unsafe situations and report the incident for follow-up investigation.

Employee Participation\n\n\n\nBoise Cascade has developed a written program for the covered processes to ensure that safety concerns of employees are addressed.  The facility personnel are encouraged to actively participate in the prevention program activities for all the processes. Employees are consulted and informed about all aspects of t e RMP rule prevention program including process hazard analysis and operating procedures.\n\n12 Hot Work Permits\n\nBoise Cascade has established  a hot work program to manage spark or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions at the mill. A hot work activity requires a hot work permit to be filled and properly signed by the appropriate  personnel before work commences. Training in the hot work permit procedures is included in the Wallula mill's safety training requirements.\n\n\n\n12.  Contractors\n\nBoise Cascade has established a contractor safety training program that ensures that all contract work is performed in a safe manner.  The Wallula facility provides safety training for all contractor personnel on the hazards of the process, emergency response procedures, safe work practices, and personnel protection.  The contractor and their employees are required to have this training before beginning work at the facility.  All the contractor training is documented by the safety department.\n\n\n\n4.0 WORSE CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires that Boise Cascade provide an off-site consequence analysis for the worse-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios for the facility.  The only covered processes at the Wallula mill are the Program 3 covered chlorine dioxide generation and storage.  Therefore, Boise Cascade must submit a single worse-case release scenario for the RMP covered substance at the mill, and an alternate release scenario for the covered process.\n\n\n\nThe worse-case scenario for the Wallula mill  is"

This would involve a 30 minute spill from the rupture of an 8-inch diameter pipe used to transfer chlorine dioxide from one of the two storage tanks to the bleach tanks.  The amount of aqueous chlorine dioxide released under this scenario is 500 gallons per minute, at a chlorine dioxide concentration of 11.5 grams per liter (g/L).  The total amount of chlorine dioxide released is 9.5 to 11.5 g/L.  The release rate from the liquid pool was modeled using the Kawamura-Mackay evaporation model, modified to account for the changing concentration of chlorine dioxide in the remaining liquid.  The release was than modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion model for dense gas releases.  The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration (2.8 mg/m3) is 1.61 miles.  Approximately 19 people live within this distance of the mill, as estimated using the U.S. Census Bureau's LANDVIEW3 software.  Additionally, the Columbia River is located within this distance of the release.\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBoise Cascade keeps records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the Wallula mill.  This history indicates a good record of accidental release prevention over the last five years.  No releases of Chlorine Dioxide have occurred from Boise Cascade that have resulted in the consequences of interest (i.e. deaths, injuries, or significant damages on site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in -place, property damage, or environmental damage off site). The Wallula Mill continues to stress the importance of safety and achieving no reportable incidents within it's next five-year accident history.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn addition to the prevention program, Boise Cascade maintains a written integrated emergency response plan to safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
