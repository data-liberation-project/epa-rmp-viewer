Formaldehyde is one of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk Management Planning rule and is included as part of this submission because it is stored at the facility in excess of 15,000 pounds.\n\nPentaerythritol and Trimethylolpropane are used in the production of resins for paint and coatings, inks and adhesives, lubricants and urethane foam. Sodium Formate is used for paper bleaching, leather tanning, cattle feed and in the production of liquid detergents.  Acetaldehyde is a raw material used in the production of Pentaerythritol.  Storage of acetaldehyde is included in this submission because acetaldehyde is one of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk Management Planning rule and it is stored at the Toledo facility in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\nPrevention program\n\nPerstorp Polyols considers prevention of accidental releases at all stages of the plant operation.  This prevention program begins with designing for safety in the processes.  All systems are designed according to accepted industry codes.  Perstorp Polyols plants and operating systems are designed and operated with redundant safety systems and instrumentation.  The purpose of these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the event a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology is used in the design and construction of processes.  All new or modified plants are inspected and reviewed before start-up.  Tanks used to store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary containment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases from reaching soil, ground or surface w"

Most tanks are equipped with high level alarms that alert operators that the tanks are nearly full and some of these alarms are equipped to shutdown the pump that is supplying the tank to prevent overfilling.\n\nAnother step of the prevention program includes the maintenance of the plants and their safety systems.  Preventative maintenance on processes is regularly conducted to protect against equipment failures.  While this does not guarantee that equipment will not occasionally break down, it reduces the risk that a problem will occur.  Safety systems are inspected and tested regularly to ensure that they will be operational if a problem develops within the process.  This includes annual or semiannual inspection and testing of fire suppression systems by outside contractors as well as inspection and testing of pressure relief devices within the processes.  Systems that are designed to shutdown when an upset occurs are often tested during plant downtime to ensure they will function to shut the process down if the upset condition occurs.\n\nPerstorp Polyols employees prevent accidents by operating the processes in a safe and efficient manner.  Our operators are well trained in operating instructions for the processes.  They were involved in the development of many of these operating instructions, either by reviewing the instructions when they were being written or by writing the instructions themselves.  Written unloading and operating instructions are regularly reviewed and kept up to date.\n\nPerstorp Polyols believes that safe design, good maintenance practices, and well-trained operators are very important parts of the prevention program.  However, we have found that a key part of managing our processes is taking a critical and independent look at our operation on a regular basis.  These reviews are designed and used to ensure that we do what our procedures say that we are doing.  Therefore, Perstorp Polyols conducts audits and reviews on safety and environment"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nPerstorp Polyols, Inc. is submitting this Risk Management Plan to fulfill the requirements of Section 112 of the Clean Air Act.  This plan contains information on the processes involving Formaldehyde and Acetaldehyde at the Perstorp Polyols' facility, the prevention programs for the processes, the emergency response program for the facility, the necessary release scenario using EPA criteria and guidance documents for modeling, and the facility's five-year accident history.  This section is designed to summarize the information contained in the plan and describe the approach to prevention of releases used by Perstorp Polyols in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nPerstorp Polyols is committed to operating the facility in a safe and environmentally friendly-manner.  We have committed to making continuous progress toward the vision of no accidents, injuries, or harm to the environment.   One way that Perstorp Polyols demonstrates this commitment is by participating in the Responsible Care initiative.  Responsible Care is an initiative developed by the American Chemistry Council designed to improve performance in the areas of safety, health, and the environment.  Perstorp Polyols signed the Guiding Principles of Responsible Care in 1988 and reaffirmed our commitment in 2005 with achievement of certification to RC14001&reg;.  Responsible Care includes a management system that addresses performance in the areas of process safety, community outreach and emergency response, distribution of products and raw materials, prevention of pollution, employee health and safety, security, as well as product stewardship.\n\nPerstorp Polyols in Toledo has earned certification under the International Standards Organization (ISO) 14001:2015 standard for environmental management systems and the ACC RC14001:2013 standard.  These certifications mean that the Toledo facility has a functioning environmental, health, safety and secur"

By addressing these matters this way, Perstorp Polyols is incorporating the management of EHSS issues in our work every day to reduce the risk of accidents that could result in harm to our employees, the public, and the environment.  Perstorp Polyols is also certified under the ISO 9001-2015 standard for Quality Systems.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Planning process, Perstorp Polyols has worked closely with the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This close working relationship helps educate our emergency responders of the risks that are presented by our facility, the work that is on-going to prevent accidents from occurring and reduce the potential impact of an accident if it occurs, and make them more familiar with our facility.  We also benefit from this relationship in that we learn from the experience of our emergency responders in dealing with incidents at other facilities and the preventative actions that can be taken to further reduce the risk of an accident at our facility.  \n\nPerstorp Polyols annually reports its EHSS performance in a Sustainability Report that is issued by the Perstorp Group separately from the annual financial report.  The annual Sustainability Report for the Perstorp Group can be found on the Perstorp web-site at www.perstorp.com.\n\n\nPerstorp Polyols' Toledo facility\n\nPerstorp Polyols, Inc. is part of the Perstorp Group, a global company active in the application areas of chemistry and materials technology. Perstorp Polyols Inc began operations in Toledo, Ohio in 1977 with the purchase of a Pentaerythritol and Sodium Formate manufacturing facility. Since 1977 the operations have expanded to include manufacturing of Trimethylolpropane, Formaldehyde and concrete admixtures.\n\nIn 1997, Perstorp Polyols completed construction and started a new state-of-the-art Formaldehyde plant.

We use internal reviews of procedures and operations to verify they reflect the appropriate level of safety, quality and environmental protection.  Independent third-party verifiers regularly review our quality and EHSS management systems to ensure that Perstorp Polyols continuously improves the operation of the facility.\n\nIn addition to the work under the ISO standards described earlier and the Responsible Care initiative, Perstorp Polyols incorporates the requirements of government requirements such as the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Plan in the overall management system for safety, health and the environment.  This ensures that protection of the environment and employee safety is a part of every day operations at Perstorp Polyols.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDespite the prevention program described earlier, Perstorp Polyols must prepare and plan for emergencies that may occur.  There are many government regulations that require emergency plans.  In 1996, OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard, and Department of Transportation worked together to develop a uniform plan for emergencies.  That plan, called the Integrated Contingency Plan, is used at Perstorp Polyols to provide a single source of information and procedures in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the plan have been provided to the Toledo Fire and Police Departments, several local hospitals, the City of Toledo Division of Environmental Services and the Ohio EPA so they are aware of the emergency plan at Perstorp Polyols.\n\nTraining is provided to our employees on the plan at least once a year.  Evacuation drills for employees are conducted annually as well.  The facility is equipped with an emergency alarm that sounds throughout the facility to alert employees.  This alarm is tested regularly to ensure that it is operational and can be heard throughout the facility.  Occasionally drills are performed on-site in conj"
