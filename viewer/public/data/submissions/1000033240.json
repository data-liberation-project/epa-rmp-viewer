This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nNesika Energy, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nNesika Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Scandia, Republic County, Kansas.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn and grain sorghum.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Nesika Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.4 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored on site.\n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 218,400 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\n\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Residential homes are located within this 0.4 mile radius.\n\n\n\nAlthough Nesika Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario."

There has also been limited need for Management of Change, therefore the original program is still in place and reviewed when needed.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nNesika Energy, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on site.  There have been no accidents that have released any substances since the establishment of Nesika Energy, LLC.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nNesika Energy, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Nesika Energy, LLC 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
