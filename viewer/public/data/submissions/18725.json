This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \n\nWe have one regulated substance, chlorine, that is above the threshold quantity as specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68, therefore we must comply with the RMP program. This program provides our facility with an integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazards posed by chlorine. Under this program, our facility has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment. \n\nLike the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the UF WRF facility to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated wastewater before its reuse. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community and the environment.   \n\nThe UF Physical Plant Division's commitment at the UF WRF facility is to store, handle and use chlorine to achieve the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks. This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process, operating safely, and training the operatoers. The UF WRF also has three chlorine detectors in the chlorine storage room and an emergency chlorine scrubber which will activate automatically in case of a releas and nutrelize the storage room's air before emitting to atmosphere. Our commitment to safety is demonstrated in the fact that over the UF WRF's operating history, no chlorine accidents have occurred that "

The registration has been submitted to the proper authorities and is attached to this written plan. The University has also registered the process with the Department of Community Affairs in Tallahassee, the lead agency for RMP Program 3 enforcement in Florida.    \n\nManagement System \n\nThe management system at our facility oversees the implementation of the RMP elements. The plant superintendent is responsible for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements. He requires adherence to the risk prevention program, arranges for periodic compliance audits, updates to process hazard analyses, updates process safety information to keep the program current, and delegates the day-to-day responsibility of the various program components according to job type. For example, the management of change program is the responsibility of maintenance employees who might change out process equipment,  plant operators are responsible for ensuring that the process operating procedures and training are revised to reflect such change in equipment.  \n               \nHazard Assessment\n\nOur written hazard assessment program evaluates the impact of significant accidental releases on the public health and environment and develops a history of such releases including:\n\nOffsite Consequence Parameters: The off-site consequence parameters are the factors that define the offsite significance of the worst-case and alternative scenarios. For toxic substances, the most significant parameters are the endpoint specified in the regulation for each toxic substance, the release rate for each scenario, and the meteorological data that determines the distance that a release will travel before it reaches the designated endpoint. For chlorine, the endpoint is define"

The release rate for the worst-case scenario is specified by rule as a chlorine cylinder being released over a 10-minute period, while the release rate in the alternative (more realistic) scenario is based on the release from a lead washer leak over a 30-minute period. \n\nThe EPA default meteorological conditions were used for the worst-case and alternative scenarios to arrive at a distance to endpoint, which is the radius of the circle of impact used to identify potential human and environmental receptors.             \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario: The following summarizes the worst-case scenarios of a substance release at our facility:  \n- Release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine (entire cylinder) over a I0-min period.                          \n- Release occurs to open air. \n- The wind speed is 1.5 meters per second, and the atmospheric stability class if \"F\", which is very stable and therefore able to carry a gas release the greatest distance.                      \n- The distance to the chlorine endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is estimated by RMP*Comp to be 0.9 miles from the release.    \n\nAlternative Release Scenario: The following summarizes the alternative release scenarios of a substance release at our facility:\n- Release of chlorine gas around a lead washer used to seat the yoke to the cylinder.        \n- Gas detection and alarm, and Gainesville Fire Department response leading to the leak being fixed, is conservatively estimated to occur within 30 minutes from the time the release occurs.\n- The wind speed is 3.0 meters per second, and the atmospheric stability     class is \"D\" which is moderately stable atmosphere that provides some chlorine gas dispersion.   \n- The distance to the chlorine endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is estimated by RMP*Comp to be less than 0.

The analysis will be updated as necessary to reflect any new insight gained from periodic compliance audits (every 3 years) and updates to the process hazard analysis (every 5 years).  \n\nOff-site Consequence analysis Documentation: The documentation for the UF WRF hazard assessment is contained in the report entitled Hazard Assessment For The University of Florida Water Reclamation Facility kept on file at the Plant, the Physical Plant Division/Operations Engineering and the Environmental Health and Safety Division.       \n\nFive-year Accident History: There have been no serious accidents involving chlorine at UF WRF in the 5 years prior to this RMP Plan.             \n\nPrevention Program \n\nOur prevention program ensures that the elements of the risk management program are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the overall program and for each element of the program.\nThe following paragraphs provide a brief summary of each element and its function in the overall risk prevention program at University of Florida WRF:  \n\nProcess Safety Information: Prior to conducting any process hazard analyses, our facility compiles written process safety information regarding process chemicals, technology, and equipment.
