This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.\n\n\n\nFREEPORT LNG POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY\n\n\n\nRisk management and safety are core principles at Freeport LNG. Freeport LNG is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reduce risks to health and the environment.\n\nCommitment to environment, health, and safety (EHS) starts with the CEO. Senior management routinely dedicates time to review EHS matters. Emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Department regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions and strive for continuous improvement. Freeport LNG's EHS programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Freeport LNG's commitment to health, environment and safety. These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to assist our facilities to prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents. Should an accidental hazardous substance release occur, we also have implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Program to promptly respond, address, and minimize the consequences of the release.\n\n\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\n\n\nThe Freeport LNG natural gas Storage and Trucking Facility is located at 1914 FM 523 , Oyster Creek, Texas. The facility will receive Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) through an underground pipeline from the Freeport LNG Pretreatment Facility approximately 1 Mile to the north.

The stored NGL Condensate will be pumped through loading bays into tank trucks with a capacity up to 10,600 gallons. The NGL having varying percentages of the above listed hydrocarbons constitutes a flammable mixture at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Freeport LNG STF has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases. This program is designed to address the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, - OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) and 40 CFR 68 - EPA's Risk Management Program. This prevention program addresses processes that handle the regulated substances. The accidental release prevention program includes the following components and activities:\n\nIn depth hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel;\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\nOperators, mechanics and contractor personnel are qualified and trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n\n\nA management of change system is in place to ensure that process-operating changes are managed safely;\n\n\n\nPre-start up reviews are performed to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n\n\nIncidents are investigated and actions taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; Routine audits are conducted to ensure that safe practices are being followed;\n\n\n\nStorage vessels are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry-standard practices of construction.
