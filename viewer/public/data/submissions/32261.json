Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Stephenson Service Company are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental \nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Pearl City fire \ndepartment, Stephenson County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release\n and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for \ndirect application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system \nconsists of one 26,000 gallon and one 18,000 gallon storage tank(s), loading risers, associated \nplumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to \nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \ncontractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be \n741,000  pounds,  this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be \nstored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \napplicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions \nof \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-\n61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted \nby state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous \nAmmonia\". The propane facility was designed and constructed in accordance with \nNFPA-58. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees\nmake up our accident release prevention program.  \n\n4. Five year accident history.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five \nyears th"
