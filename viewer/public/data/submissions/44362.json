The entire inventories of all six tanks are simuilated due to the fact that all of the valves on the individual banks are normally open and tied into a single header.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the public would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting data elements of the Risk Management Plan\r\n \r\nAlternate Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this scenario is 0.2 miles.  This scenario assumed that a tuck loading pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 255 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.
