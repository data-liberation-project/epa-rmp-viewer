(Milkco) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Asheville, North Carolina facility.  Milkco's operations include the processing and packaging of milk products, orange juice and flavored drink products.  Milkco has been in operation at this facility for over 34 years and provides over 260 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nMilkco is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Milkco policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nMilkco is required to maintain low temperatures in the milk processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Milkco uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the 55,000 sq ft storage area within the required range of operating temperatures.  Milkco's refrigeration system consisting of a high-pressure receiver, recirculator, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain a quantity of anhydrous ammonia in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold given in 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Milkco has implemented several precautionary measures.  Milkco has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program.  As such, the anhydrous ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a system has been evaluated for release potential.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, relief valves, check valves and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (leak detection sensors, interlocks and automatic shutoffs via remote switch or computer modem).  \n\n\n\nMilkco has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) with incorporated safety measures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  Milkco encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the plant.  Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, questions, or ideas during the monthly training sessions or during the quarterly safety meetings.  Conversely, Milkco employees may approach their supervisor directly or place suggestions in the suggestion box for topics that require more immediate attention.\n\n\n\nMilkco understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  As such, an independent engineering company conducts preventive maintenance on the process equipment on a monthly basis.  The preventive maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  In addition, an independent third party conducts testing (thermographic studies) semi-annually to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components.\n\n\n\nTo confirm that control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.  In accordance with the PSM program, Milkco will conduct compliance audits every three years.  The local fire department does not conduct formal audits; however, Milkco occasionally invites the fire department to tour the facility.  In addition, the following agencies audit the Milkco facility on a regular basis:\n\n\n\n* Nor"

Included in the emergency response program are measures to be taken internally by Milkco and procedures to inform local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nMilkco has trained approximately 40 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases and other emergencies.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  Six of these personnel are trained to the level of Incident Commander and 34 personnel are trained to the technician level.  They receive annual update training.\n\n\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with Milkco's emergency response procedures, copies of the emergency response document have been submitted for review and approval by the local agencies.  Buncombe County Emergency Management Committee (EMC) has reviewed Milkco's emergency response procedures.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release resulting in offsite consequences, the general public will be notified by the EMC.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMilkco has installed a fire sprinkler system with automated and manual controls.  Also, Milkco has implemented a continuous training program to improve safety awareness.\n\n"
