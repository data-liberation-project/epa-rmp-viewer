Equipment inspection prior to use is emphasized.  \n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years at the facility; and to our knowledge no off-site consequences reported.  \n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  \n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided the state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll. \n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews are performed to assess the maintenance and operations to establish safe operating conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."

      "SummaryText": "1.  FACILITY POLICY.\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Blick's, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Adams County LEPC or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.  \n\nThe primary activity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for wholesale purposes.  Anhydrous ammonia is not normally stored on site.  It is received and stored on- site on a  temporary basis for use only by a portable pipe reactor that visits the facility periodically.  The ammonia is stored in an ammonia tanker trailer that has been disconnected and set up a temporary feed tank and as a receiver for make-up ammonia as needed.  The portable pipe reactor is covered under OSHA'S PSM and it maintains its documentation.  This documentation is blended with the site RMP information to meet the overall requlatory requirements for this operation.  The maximum quantity ever stored on-site is 42,000 pounds (approximately 9,000 gallons).  The tank is refilled using tanker trucks as needed.  During the downtime between operation of the portable reactor, the tanker trailer/feed tank is removed from the site.  \n\n3.WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tanker trailer/feed tank.  this could result in the release of up to 42,000# of liquid ammonia over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.6 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is the rupture of an ammonia feed hose that is being used to transfer liquid ammonia from the feed pump to the portable reactor.  This could result in an ammonia release of about 200 #/minute over a 5 minute period.  The distance to the end point i"
