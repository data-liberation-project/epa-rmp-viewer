      "SummaryText": "TG Missouri Corporation (TGMO) manufactures automotive parts at its facility located at 2200 Plattin Road in Perryville, Missouri.  As part of its operation, TGMO utilizes hydrochloric acid (HCL) at a concentration up to 38% for use in the Chrome Plating Line 4 (PMF4).\n\n\n\nStorage of HCL occurs in an outdoor, 6,500-gallon double-walled above ground storage tank.  The process includes this tank and associated indoor piping leading to PMF4.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves failure of the tank and release of the entire contents to the ground.  The facility uses administrative controls to allow the tank to only be filled to 4,500 gallons.  This scenario would spill 4,500 gallons with a release rate of 1700 pounds/minute.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 7.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves accidental uncoupling of the transfer hose during tank filling.  Assuming a typical pumping rate of 100 gallons per minute and a release duration of 10 minutes, this scenario would result in 1000 gallons of material released at a rate of 377 pounds per minute.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 1.6 miles.\n\n\n\nAll employees involved in handling HCL are trained upon hire and annually thereafter in safe handling procedures.  Additionally, written procedures are in place for loading operations and TGMO personnel are required to be present during any loading/unloading operations.  TGMO has developed an emergency response plan and it is on file with the Perry County LEPC. "
