Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n    The management and employees of Conserv FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of\n    any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\n     the facility is prepared to work with the Durand Fire Department, Winnebago County Local Emergency \n     Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release                   \n     to people and the environment.\n\n2.The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility, which is located at 10945 Pecatonica Rd, is the storage of fertilizers          \n     for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop   \n     production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of one 30000 gallon storage tank, \n     nurse tanks, loading risers and associated plumbing.  Access to the site is                \n     restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \n     contractors.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 260,000\n     pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable\n     state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety\n     Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by\n     The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards\n     of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(osha), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage\n     and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our   \n     employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n4"
