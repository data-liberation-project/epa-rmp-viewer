The Cantril facility receives propane from the pipeline to two 90,000 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.  All of these tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 85% of their capacity.\n\n\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropane is delivered into two storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline.  This material is routed from these tanks to the two truck transport loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers.\n\n\n\nEthyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks.\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ?

Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The entire inventories from both tanks are simulated due to the proximity of the tanks relative to mitigation to the simulation.  This scenario assumes there would be no mit"

The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 21,267 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address a reasonable range of contingencies.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.

The 9-1-1 system will be used to notify the Van Buren County Emergency Communications Center which will make notification to the local law enforcement and Fire Department(s).  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Enterprise?s Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shut down remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.  A third-party contractor, 3E Company is under contract to contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.
