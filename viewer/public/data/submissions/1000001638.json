      "SummaryText": "Cornish Creek Executive Summary\n\nThe Cornish Creek Water Treatment Facility was constructed as part of the Newton County Cornish Creek Water Supply Project. The project, which began operation in 1992 consists of the 820 acre Roy Varner Reservoir and the 15 MGD Cornish Creek Water Treatment Facility. The facility provides potable water to all residents of Newton County and some residents of Walton and Jasper Counties. The facility consists of intake pumps, pulsating clarifiers, dual-media filters, a gaseous chlorination system for disinfection, two clear wells and distribution pumps. An expansion to 25 MGD is underway and will be completed in early 2010. The facility is owned and operated by Newton County Water Resources.\n\nNewton County Water Resources observes and complies with the Risk Management Program as set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. Compliance is accomplished by compiling a hazardous chemical list, using Material Safety\nData Sheets, ensuring that containers are labeled, and providing employee training. The purpose of the program is to alert and educate employees about chemicals in the workplace by giving them greater access to information on the physical and health hazards of chemicals, safe handling and storage precautions and emergency first aid procedures. It applies to all employees who may be exposed to hazardous substances during the scope of their employment.  The Water Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the Program and provides reviews and updates as needed. \n\nBecause of the safety policies and procedures in-place, an accidental release of\nChlorine has not occurred at the Cornish Creek Water Treatment Facility within the past five years. The Cornish Creek Water Treatment Facility is included in the community's emergency response plan. Responses to incidents are handled by the Newton County Fire Department. The Cornish Creek Water Treatment Facility will continue to provide operator training and periodically review its policies and procedures, b"
