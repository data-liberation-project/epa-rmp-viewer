If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Taylor County LEPC, and/or any other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the peoples and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\nThis facility is a retail Farm Supply Distribution Center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and ferilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved by truck, handled and stored  on site.  It is a regulated substance by the EPA, requiring us to comply with the risk management program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertiliizer for growing agricultural products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a stationary storage  tank(s).  See RMP COMP for maximum storage capacity of stationary storage and storage vessel size.\n\n     The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  the ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standardss and ASME codes.  The facility compliews with the NSI K61.1 standards EPA's aaccidental release prevention rule, IA Fertilizer Law Part 21 Chapter 43 Rule 43.6(200) as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\nOur ammonia system is protected from major  releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut offs and emergency shut off valves.  The load out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nFive-year accident history.\nThere has been"

      "SummaryText": "no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evac;uations on or off-site.\n\nThe emergency response program.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to  ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the communtiy emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.  In addition, Taygold Cooperative has an emergency responese and contingency plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
