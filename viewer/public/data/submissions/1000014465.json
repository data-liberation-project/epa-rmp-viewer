The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 18,000 gallons (water capacity).  The storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall season.\n\nPrairie Home Cooperative has several key elements in their accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Missouri.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes a discussion of properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nPrairie Home Cooperative has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases, it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nThe emergency re"
