      "SummaryText": "rous Ammonia is received and promptly mixed with Phosphoric Acid to create a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer (10-34-0). The 10-34-0 is stored sold and distributed to area farms as a source of land applied nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizer.\n\nAccidental Release Program\n         \nThis Anhydrous ammonia facility has implemented the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years there have been no or accidental releases at this site. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194.
