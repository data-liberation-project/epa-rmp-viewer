      "SummaryText": "SGS Executive Summary \n\n\n\nTucson Electric Power Company (\"TEP\") operates the Springerville Generating Station (\"SGS\") located near Springerville, Arizona.  SGS uses an ammonia system process at Generating Units 3 and 4 that contains Anhydrous Ammonia in inventories greater than the RMP and PSM threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs. The ammonia system supplies the Selective Catalytic Reduction (\"SCR\") system with a consistent and reliable source of Anhydrous Ammonia. The ammonia system includes the storage and injection areas. The storage equipment consists of two (2) storage tanks (each having a maximum capacity of 22,840 gallons with an 85% administrative control), rail tank car unloading station, truck unloading station, tank heaters and ammonia supply vaporizer. The injection equipment in the SCR area consists of vapor dilution skids, balancing manifolds, and Ammonia Injection Grid (\"AIG\").\n\n\n\nSGS's Anhydrous Ammonia covered process is subject to the Program 3 prevention program requirements of the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") rule, and aligns with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") standard (1910.119). SGS takes the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Release Prevention Program that are in place at SGS.\n\n\n\n1.1. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nProcess Safety Information pertains to highly hazardous chemicals in the process, technology of the process, and equipment in the process. Examples of Process Safety Information include but are not limited to Safety Data Sheets and Piping, and Instrumentation Diagrams. SGS updates its Process Safety Information using a Management of Change (\"MOC\") process to ensure critical safety information remains accurate for safe operation of the site. Employees can verbally request access for Process Safety Information to the Program Manager.  The Program Manager provides access to approved r"

The purpose of a Process Hazard Analysis (\"PHA\") is to perform a systematic review of existing and/or proposed processes to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.\n\n\n\nThe SGS management team (\"team\") with expertise in engineering and process operations conduct the PHA. The team is comprised of the SGS Station Manager and his/her direct reports (i.e. Superintendents and select supervisors).  This team reviews and approves recommendations. Once approved, the team assigns the appropriate personnel corrective actions for follow-up. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as the control measures (prevention and mitigation) currently in place and makes recommendations for additional control measures as appropriate to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable. \n\n\n\nSGS tracks action items to closure as outlined in the PHA Policy to ensure it completes follow-up items in a timely manner.  Personnel document completed items and save a copy of the document with the PHA.  SGS revalidates the PHA at least once every five years. The revalidation includes a review of any changes, MOCs, and incidents that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes recommendations for the addition of control measures as appropriate. \n\n\n\n1.2. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nSGS maintains written operating procedures for each process area that address initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency oper"
    },
    {

These operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised and are stored electronically on an internal server for employee access.  \n\n\n\n1.3. TRAINING\n\n\n\nSGS's training program includes formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, and safety training. SGS provides each employee involved in operating a covered process with initial training and refresher training, including an overview of the process and the hazards and the operating procedures developed for that process. The training supervisor or their designee is responsible for scheduling and coordinating the following training for PSM/RMP affected employees.\n\n\n\n1.4. MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment. SGS's written program details mechanical integrity practices and procedures for inspecting, testing, monitoring, and maintaining process equipment. SGS conducts routine maintenance training for maintenance personnel, and periodically reviews and updates procedures.   \n\n\n\n1.5. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe MOC program applies to changes that affect the process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process. SGS reviews and approves a proposed modification at conception under the MOC and pre-start up safety review (\"PSSR\") process prior to implementing the change. SGS tracks the MOC requests and once all the required technical reviews are completed, approves the MOC for change implementation. Training requirements for affected personnel vary depending on the significance of the change. For changes requiring significant updates to procedures or equipment, special training sessions (meeting the training requirements of the company's RMP/PSM programs"

      "SummaryText": ") may be necessary for operators, mechanics, and/or contractors. For less significant changes, communicating information about the change and its anticipated effects on operation/maintenance may substitute for training sessions.\n\n\n\n1.6. PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nNew facilities and modified facilities (when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information) must conduct a PSSR. The PSSR process is used in conjunction with the MOC  process. If the change triggers a PSSR, then approval for startup also satisfies the site's PSSR requirements. The PSSR process requires the appropriate personnel to verify that the change was constructed and installed per the approved design and equipment specifications following the completion of the installation and prior to startup.\n\n\n\n1.7. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nSGS audits the RMP/PSM program every three years and verifies that the procedures and practices developed to comply with the RMP Prevention Program and PSM regulations are adequate and followed.  A team knowledgeable in the process, but impartial to the facility or area being audited, conducts compliance audits.  The audit team develops findings and forwards them to SGS Management for resolution.  SGS tracks corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings to closure as outlined in the Compliance Audit Policy, documents the final resolution of each finding and saves the two most recent audit reports on the internal server.  SGS communicates the audit results to relevant personnel and identifies additional training opportunities.   \n\n\n\n1.8. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nSGS conducts an investigation for every incident that results, or could reasonably have resulted, in a release of Ammonia from the Ammonia System according to the Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure. SGS shares the results of the investigation and lessons learned with appropriate personnel to prevent future recurrence, tracks any corrective actions resu"

To date, SGS has not had an incident that required investigation. \n\n\n\n1.9. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nSGS encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and develops cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses, incident investigations and compliance audits. SGS makes all new employees aware of the RMP/PSM program as a part of the initial orientation process.  At least one hourly employee or representative of the hourly employee directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the site operations is in all meetings and/or formal discussions concerning RMP/PSM policies and procedures. All files associated with the RMP/PSM program are available by request to the Program Manager.\n\n\n\n1.10. SAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\n\n\nSGS has safe work practices in place to identify, evaluate and eliminate or mitigate risks associated with high-risk operations to ensure safe and reliable operations. Examples of these include but are not limited to: \n\n     \n\n     Confined Space Entry  -  the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous  work areas; \n\n     \n\n     Energy Isolation  - a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of hazardous energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; \n\n     \n\n     Line Opening/Breaks - procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance; \n\n     \n\n     Hot Work Permit - a permit procedure to control activities that may be a source of ignition (i.e. hot work); and \n\n     \n\n     Security Entry and Control - the controlled entry of personnel into process areas.  \n\n\n\nSGS work practices and training of personnel involved in these types of work ensure safe operations and maintenance activities. \n\n\n\n1.11.
