Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWhenever a change in process occurs, our management of change procedures ensure that we evaluate the impact on health and safety, modify the operating procedures and safety information as necessary, and inform and train our employees.\n\nPre-Startup Review\nWhenever a process change is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the management of change procedures, we will perform a pre-startup review prior to initiating the process.  The pre-startup review includes a confirmation of design specifications, operating procedures, process hazard analysis and employee training.\n\nCompliance Audits\nWe conduct compliance audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are performed at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nWe have consulted with employees and their representatives regarding development of the Process Hazard Analysis and other elements of process safety management to ensure that they have access to all information to be developed under this rule.\n\nHot Work Permit\nWe have a Hot Work Permit program in place to meet the requirements of OSHA 29CFR1910.252(a).  This program minimizes the likelihood of an accidental fire by requiring planning and preparation for hot work conducted on or near a covered process.\n\nContractors\nIn order to ensure a safe facility, we check the safety performance o"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n(Site: 6200)\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:\n\nThis facility handles ammonia, which is considered to be a regulated toxic substance by EPA.  We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  This facility is subject to Program 3 of the Risk Management Program because it is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for ammonia storage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is fertilizer production.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck and store it as a liquid in a pressurized vessel.  We receive aqua ammonia (44.8% solution) by transport truck and store it in an atmospheric vessel.  Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 15,000 gallons (water capacity).  The maximum amount of aqua ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 22,000 gallons (water capacity)\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of the 15,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60 F).  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 1.81 miles, based on the dense gas dispersion model Dega"

This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 12,837 residents, commercial/industrial areas, recreation areas, schools and cemeteries within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to a cracked hose or failed fitting.  The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by closing the shut-off valves.  The contents of the hose are released over a period of ten minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 317 feet, based on the dense gas dispersion model Degadis.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 12 residents and a business within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for aqua ammonia is failure of the 22,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity.  It is conservatively assumed that the ammonia is released from solution over a period of ten minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 1.80 miles, based on the dense gas dispersion model Degadis.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 12,695 residents, commercial/industrial areas, recreation areas, schools and cemeteries within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for aqua ammonia is a pipe leak.  The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by closing the shut-off valves.  Fifty-one pounds of aqua ammonia is released over a period of ten minutes.  It is conservatively assumed that the ammonia is immediately released from solution.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 317 feet, based on the dense gas dispersion model Degadis.
