The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\nAt General Chemical's Augusta Plant, one listed chemical, Oleum, is managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria. As identified in this plan, the Augusta Plant is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for management of Oleum.\n\nThis RMP describes the Augusta Plant's risk management program which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance"

However, if a release does occur, the Augusta Plant has prepared employees, in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release.\n\n2.0\tDescription of stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGeneral Chemical's Augusta Plant produces Oleum and Sulfuric Acid in a state-of-the-art production process that was designed and built by Monsanto Enviro-chem.  The initial start-up of this new plant was on September 15, 1997. Oleum and Sulfuric Acid are used in many applications including water treatment, papermaking, detergents, batteries, nylon and computer chips.\n\nOleum is transferred off-site via pipeline to a neighboring chemical company. The Oleum inventory on-site is 14,400,000 pounds.\n\n\tProcess:  Oleum Production\nRegulated Chemical : Oleum\nUse:  Product\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) :  14,400,000\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions require that General Chemical provide information about the worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenario for Oleum handled at its Augusta Plant.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n3.1\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fail and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time. A USEPA designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Augusta Plant assumes that a storage tank containing Oleum fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems simultaneously fail, except for the secondary containment currently installed around the Oleum storage tank, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The USEPA- designated table states that th"

      "SummaryText": "e material released would travel 4.3 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n3.2\tAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case release scenario; is calculated from a USEPA-designated table; and, is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for Oleum at the Augusta Plant assumes Oleum would be lost due to failure of a transfer line during the transfer process.  It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release.  The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 0.47 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at the Augusta Plant includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\n* Standard Operating Procedures - Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\n*"

The incident occurred during the course of start-up of our Sulfuric Acid plant when some cooling equipment was not properly engaged.  This caused the release of approximately seven pounds of Sulfur Trioxide and 78 pounds of Sulfuric Acid mist through our stack during a 10-minute period.  Both of these quantities are below the reportable quantity identified by the USEPA that triggers release reporting. \n\nAs a result of this release, a complete incident investigation was performed.   This included a detailed process hazard analysis to identify the root cause of the release.  Process modifications have been made in response to this release to reduce the risk of reoccurrence.\n\n6.0\tEmergency Response Program\n\nGeneral Chemical's Augusta Plant maintains an integrated contingency plan which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

The Augusta Plant, the LEPC and the local fire departments have coordinated communication to notify the public quickly, if necessary, as well as facilitate quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Augusta Plant conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve emergency response organizations.    \n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Augusta Plant performs periodic process hazard analysis to evaluate and to strive continuously to improve health, safety and environmental performance as technical developments, scientific understanding, consumer and community needs, and regulatory requirements evolve and change, some of which result in process modifications.  For example, the following improvements are currently planned for the Augusta Plant:\n\n* Installation of process equipment to produce 99% Sulfuric Acid within the process to eliminate blending Oleum in the storage tank.\n* Installation of additional process control equipment and alarms.  \n* Standardization of plant operations by implementation of ISO 9000 procedures.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.0\tCertification\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Donald W.
