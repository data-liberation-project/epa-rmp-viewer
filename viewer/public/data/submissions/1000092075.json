Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Stephenson Service Company are committed to the \n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental \n\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Pearl City fire \n\ndepartment, Stephenson County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release\n\n and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 3675 IL Rt 73 South, Pearl City IL 61062, is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for \n\ndirect application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for \n\ndirect application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system \n\nconsists of storage tank(s), loading risers, associated \n\nplumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to \n\nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \n\ncontractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be \n\n760,000  pounds,  this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be \n\nstored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario. \n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is\n\nsecurity-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by\n\nEPA regulations.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \n\napplicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions \n\nof \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-\n\n61.1\", published by The American National St"
