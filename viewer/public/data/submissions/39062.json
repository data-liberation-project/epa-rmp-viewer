      "SummaryText": "The Millington Wastewater Treatment Plant (MWWTP) has chlorine on site that requires protection as defined under Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The City of Millington, TN, has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the worst case scenarios for a release of chlorine, the management systems and monitoring systems in place to prevent such a release, and the training and employee participation in the PSM program.\n\nThe MWWTP treats and disposes of all sanitary waste discharged to the City Sewer System.  The facility utilizes 1-ton cylinders to treat the wastewater in the chlorination room.  One cylinder is always connected to the chlorination system and one cylinder is always stored as a backup. The MWWTP also uses sulfur dioxide cylinders to treat wastewater, but stores less than the 5,000 pound threshold for RMP reporting.  \n\nThe RMP calculates that the worst case scenario for a release involving the storage of chlorine would be caused by vandalism of both the chlorine cylinders in the chlorine room.  Because only one of the cylinders are connected at a time, a process failure could only release no more than 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  Vandalism or terrorist activities could cause the release of chlorine from both cylinders, potentially releasing 4,000 pounds of chlorine. The worst-case release scenario is further detailed below.  EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp was used in the consequence analysis.\n\nWorst Case\nChemical and Amount Released: 4,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes inside the Chlorine Room of the Maintenance Building.\nWeather Conditions:77 \u00baF with a 3."

Security systems around the property and chlorine detection sensors would prevent this scenario from occurring. \n\nThe alternate release scenario is more plausible than the worst case scenario, but measures are in place to prevent and mitigate such a release.  The alternate release scenario involves the simultaneous failure of a piece of chlorine handling equipment (piping, valve, etc) and the vacuum breaker.  The vacuum breaker is attached directly to the chlorine cylinder and is designed to fail shut if a leak in the lines develops. If the vacuum breaker fails open (sticks) and a leak develops in the piping, chlorine would be released into the Chlorinator Room.  The leak would be detected by the chlorine monitoring system and facility personnel or the Millington Fire Department would be able to respond quickly and shut off the cylinder at the main cylinder valve. \n\nAlternate Case\nChemical and Amount Released: 500 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes inside the Chlorine Room of the Maintenance Building.\nWeather Conditions:77 \u00baF with a 6.7 mph wind in Class D atmospheric stability\n\nThis release would impact the area around the MWWTP within 0.1 mile radius and affect less than 10 people and a pet cemetery. \n\nThe MWWTP is in compliance with OSHA PSM and emergency action plan regulations, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 rules.  The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the MWWTP in good condition.  There have been no accidental releases at the MWWTP during the last five years.\n\nShould there be a significant chlorine release, the Millington Fire Department (MFD) will respond.  The MFD has several trained Hazardous Material technicians that can handle any accidental chlorine release.  The MFD provides emergency response tra"

The NSA can respond with a HAZMAT team within 10 minutes.         \nAnnual waste water operator certification and continuing education maintains and continually improves safety at the MWWTP."
