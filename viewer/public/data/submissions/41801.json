This variation of the worst-case scenario is considered more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  The impact area must still include off-site receptors.  However, it is important to understand that although the occurrence of the alternate release scenario is considered as more realistic, the FCWA considers it still to be highly unlikely due to engineering and administrative controls at the Occoquan WTP.   \r\n\r\nEPA regulations encourage facilities to select the alternate release scenario from one that has occurred at some point in the past at the facility or from one identified through the process hazards analysis.  Due to no historical off-site releases at the Occoquan WTP within the last 20 years, the alternate release scenario selected, although still unlikely, was one identified through the process hazard analysis.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, the alternate release assumed that the largest vessel of chlorine (1-ton cylinder) is released. \r\n\r\n\tFigure 1 presents the alternate case release scenario  estimating a 0.1 mile radius and approximately 200 people to be effected.\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC FILE DELETED\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n \r\nThe EPA RMP regulations require each regulated facility to report all ac"

The Occoquan WTP is located at the end of Mill Street in the Town of Occoquan, approximately 1 mile north of Interstate 95. \r\n\r\nThe Occoquan WTP is a drinking water provider and has an average capacity of 26 million gallons of drinking water a day.   Operations at the Occoquan WTP fall into the 22131 Standard Industrial Classification.\r\n\r\nAt the Occoquan WTP, the FCWA pumps, treats and distributes water from the Occoquan River Reservoir to customers in the Northern Virginia Region.  To ensure the highest quality drinking water is available to its customers, the FCWA uses chlorine as a disinfectant to remove and control the growth of otherwise potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens in the drinking water supply.  Because of its relative toxicity, chlorine is listed as a regulated substances under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  Under the provisions, EPA requires that facilities having regulated chemical processes above the following threshold implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) covering the regulated process.\r\n\r\nChemical\tThreshold Quantity\r\n\r\n\tChlorine\t2,500 pounds\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to the facility in one (1) ton containers v"

There is a maximum inventory of 24 containers for a combined inventory of approximately 48,000 pounds of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe FCWA's RMP describes the potential environmental impacts and the toxicity hazards presented by the chlorine inventory at the Occoquan WTP.  Moreover, the RMP describes the FCWA's procedures to minimize the risk and prevent unwanted releases of the chemical into the surrounding communities.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\n\r\nThe FCWA has adopted policies that comply with applicable federal, state, local, and institutional regulations for design, construction,  operation, and modification of the water treatment plant facilities.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Chlorine\r\n\r\nWhile chlorine releases are rare at WTPs, the FCWA has conducted an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to evaluate the potential impacts on the surrounding \r\ncommunities should an unwanted release occur.  As directed by EPA regulations, the FCWA assumed a worst-case release scenario to consist of a 1-ton cylinder depleting its contents over a 10 minute release period.  Such a chlorine release would tend to sink, hug the ground, or follow low lying areas due to the fact that chlorine is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air.  Depending on the ambient weather conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) and the topography of the surrounding land, the chemical plume can impact the surrounding region and cause damage to human health and the environment.    \r\n\r\nTo determine how far from the Occoquan WTP a chlorine plume would travel from a 1-ton cylinder over a 10 minute release period, the FCWA utilized RMP Comp version 1.07.  Additionally, the FCWA utilized the Fairfax Joint Local Emergency Planning Committee's (FJLEPC) modeling conducted consistent with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  These approaches conservatively estimate a potential impact area that is circular with the center being the point of release.\r\n\r\nFor"

The tiers are established as Program 1, Program 2 and Program 3.  As a rule of thumb, since the FCWA's off-site consequence analysis affected off-site receptors, the FCWA falls into the Program 3 tier requirement.   Moreover, the WTP is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety therefore making compliance with Program 3 criteria mandatory under the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nThe FCWA has established a management system to assign responsibility for the development, implementation, and modification of the RMP.  The overall responsibility for implementation is assigned to the Supervisor of Water Production, with specific responsibilities assigned to management level personnel with organizational responsibility for the individual tasks (i.e. plant maintenance).\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\n\r\nThe FCWA maintains up-to-date process safety information on the chlorine and  processes at the Occoquan WTP.
