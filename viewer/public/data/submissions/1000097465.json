Hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas, and is also delivered by truck from remote locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in the part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA:  Liquid hydrogen, which is vaporized (converted) to a gas and supplied via pipeline to an on-site customer for the use in silane and polysilicon manufacturing processes. Hydrogen is also produced on site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that assure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Hemlock MI facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nAt the Hemlock facility we have installed additional process isolation valves to enhance our capability to shut down the process safely in the event of an incident. We have also upgraded our fire detection system to increase our ability to detect and respond to minor problems before they can become major incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Hemlock facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years.
