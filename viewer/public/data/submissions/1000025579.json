Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Kingsburg Apple has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Kingsburg Apple, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Kingsburg Apple has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nNorth System            Anhydrous Ammonia           45,000\n\nSouth System            Anhydrous Ammonia            9,200\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has two ammonia refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\nProcess 1 - North System\n\n(12) Rooms\n\n(2) Precools\n\n(3) Fumigation Rooms (used as precoolers)\n\n(4) CA Rooms (used as storage rooms)\n\n(2) Hydrocoolers (one hydrocooler for chilling water for packing house area)\n\n\n\nProcess 2 - South System\n\n(2) Rooms\n\n(1) Precool\n\n(4) CA Rooms (used as storage rooms)\n\n\n\nAll refrigerated spaces (both systems) are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation to the exception of the Process 1 Mezzanine coils (DX). Both hydrocooler systems are equipped with water-cooling evaporators (bare coils) and accumulators required for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nControl valve groups are in various locations, but no valve groups are on the roof. All refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room. \n\n\n\nEach flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to each main suction accumulator.  From each main"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to either a thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver or directly to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nEach system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere (Process 2) or the ammonia diffusion tank (Process 1) if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside P2 north machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area (except P1 Precool, P1 Rooms 1-2, and P2 Precools 1-2) that provides at least every 15-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the east exterior wall of each machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere (Process 2) or ammonia diffusion tanks (Process 1). The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at Kingsburg Apple consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, each refrigeration system at Kingsburg Apple is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meet"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nKingsburg Apple has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processeses. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Kingsburg Apple facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 52,400  (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nKingsburg Apple has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nKingsburg Apple's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n- California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n- Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

Nevertheless, Kingsburg Apple continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Kingsburg Apple's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Kingsburg Apple's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nKingsburg Apple has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Kingsburg Apple has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Kingsburg Apple now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Kingsburg Apple employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Kingsburg Apple will continue to maintain overall pl"
