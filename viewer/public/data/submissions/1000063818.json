      "SummaryText": "- Facility and Covered Process Overview -\r\nZF Transmissions, which is located at 2846 North Old Laurens Road in Gray Court, South Carolina, is a commercial facility that manufactures transmissions for passenger automobiles.  The facility operates under North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) of 336350.  ZF currently does and has since 2013 used the chemical anhydrous ammonia, which is used in a heat treating process known as nitro-carburizing. ZF has recently made a strategic decision to store a larger quantity of ammonia on-site.  This decision was predominantly based on the fact that, from a site (and public) safety and release prevention perspective, the most likely event in which a large quantity of ammonia has the potential to be released is during the delivery of the chemical.  In order to minimize the frequency of these deliveries, ZF has elected to begin filling its 9,200-gallon storage tank to 85% capacity (7,820 gallons), which means up to approximately 40,300 gallons of ammonia may be on-site at any given time.  Storing this amount of ammonia triggers two separate safety-focused federal program requirements: the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to ensure safety in the workplace, and the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68), which is designed ensure the safety of the general public and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe OSHA PSM Standard and EPA RMP Rule apply only to the ZF process that deals directly with ammonia, which is known as the Covered Process.  ZF's Covered Process consists of a single above ground storage tank and associated equipment, the ammonia transfer lines and equipment from the tank to three (3) Ipsen heat treat furnaces, and the Ipsen furnaces and auxiliary equipment.  All of this ammonia equipment is designed to perform a single function - nitro-carburizing the surface of some internal transmission components.

      "SummaryText": "nia to its use in the furnaces, is further detailed below.\r\n\r\nLiquid ammonia is stored outside the building in a pressurized 9,200-gallon bulk above ground storage tank, where a vaporizer uses an electric heating element to heat the ammonia to its vaporization point, creating a gas. This increases the tank pressure. When the set point for pressure is reached, the heating element automatically switches off. This pressure build up allows the ammonia to transfer through dedicated piping to the furnaces and associated furnace equipment without the use of a any pumps.\r\n\r\nAmmonia gas flows through and pressurizes the main ammonia transfer line.  This main line is then divided into three (3) smaller supply lines - one for each Ipsen nitro-carburizing furnace.  Each furnace uses ammonia to form nitrates via two processes: breaking down the ammonia using a cracker unit and decomposing the ammonia via furnace heat and contact with the metal transmission parts. The ammonia sent to the cracking unit is heated past its dissociation point and sent through a catalyst which cracks or splits the nitrates from the ammonia.  The resulting hydrogen and nitrogen are sent to the furnace; the nitrates are absorbed by the metal parts, creates a compound layer on the surface of the parts, providing anti-scuffing and improved fatigue resistance.  The hydrogen is burned off in the furnace's afterburner system.  After the completion of the nitro-carburzing processes, the waste gases (primarily nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and any residual ammonia) are discharged from the furnace into an afterburner system to break them down and exhausted through a dedicated exhaust stack out of the roof of the building.\r\n\r\nAs a company, ZF takes an extremely conservative approach to workplace safety.  Each Covered Process area described above (unloading of ammonia, bulk storage of ammonia, the heat treat furnace area) is not only designed to be as inherently safe as possible, but has also been analyz"

These valves are rated by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) specifically for use with anhydrous ammonia.  The pressure relief valves are capable and design to operate independently of one another, such that one can be replaced without losing temporary functionality of the tank and safety of the pressure relief device.\r\nEach Ipsen furnace is equipped with an overpressure valve that is designed to dissipate any overpressures that may be created in the furnace interior if it is operated incorrectly or in a fault condition.  Each overpressure valve consists a tear foil to release the excess pressure (and furnace gas), which activates at a specific pressure.  The valve is also supplemented with a cap and spring for excess pressure release.  The furnace utilizes a burner safety system that, when activated (when the valve foil tears), burns off any ammonia that may have released during the overpressure event, preventing its release into the environmental and potential exposure of ZF employees to ammonia vapors.\r\n\r\nSafety programmable logic control: A programmable logic control (PLC) is used for automation of furnace processes within the heat treat area.  A PLC is a real-time system where output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a bounded time (else unintended operation or results will occur).  The PLC is designed for multiple input and output parameters and arrangements (such as temperature, pressure, or flow arrangements for different heat treatment processes).

The dedicated ventilation system for each Ipsen furnace is integral for the operation of the Covered Process.  During normal operation, after each furnace cycle has run, the residual atmosphere of the furnace interior is exhausted through the afterburner to break down the gases and then discharged outside of the building.  In the case of an overpressure within the internal furnace atmosphere, a relief system releases the overpressure gases.  These gases are burned up using a dedicated pilot burner and exhausted outside of the building.\r\n\r\nAmmonia detection and monitoring: The most critical component of the ammonia Covered Process system design is the ammonia gas detection and monitoring system.  In order to provide consistent gas monitoring, a series of stationary gas detectors and controllers are located throughout the facility in areas where a concern of internal ammonia releases exists.  Specifically, gas detection is provided as follows: eight (8) ammonia detectors and an associated controller are located on the main north/south aisle way of the plant to monitor the most traveled aisle way for employees to access the manufacturing areas; eight (8) ammonia detectors and an associated controller are located around the perimeter of the Ipsen furnaces and heat treating area of the facility; and, three (3) ammonia detectors and an associated controller are on the mix battery of the Ipsen furnaces themselves.\r\n\r\nFire control and suppression: The fire control and extinguishing system in the ammonia bulk storage tank area is the presence of a local fire hydrant less than 100 feet away from the storage tank itself, as well as a Class ABC fire extinguisher accessible to the bulk unloading area."

Through this LEPC, the Gray Court Fire Department, Green Pond Volunteer Fire Department, and Fountain Inn Fire Department have been notified of and trained on potential spill, fire, and other emergency response needs that may exist at ZF as a result of the presence of ammonia.  These parties, including the Laurens County LEPC director, also have regular meetings with ZF to receive updates on process information, chemical storage locations, and discuss other pertinent site changes that may affect outside emergency response.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the LEPC and use of local fire and rescue departments, ZF maintains its own first responders for hazardous chemical response on all three shifts.  These responders are all HAZWOPER-certified and specially trained personnel that are familiar with ammonia exposure and response, and have access to necessary PPE  to provide response as needed.  These response personnel are trained not only in general ammonia information, response, and procedures, but also ZF-specific emergency procedures and response to other specific hazards as they apply to the facility.\r\n\r\nZF also has"

This plan details specific actions, notifications, activations, and responses that ZF personnel will take in the event of emergencies.  The plan also includes specific details and instructions on ammonia hazards and exposure, ammonia spill response procedures, and release mitigation measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety - \r\nZF constantly reviews the potential to make additional future changes to the Covered Process and facility in order to improve the safety of ZF employees, the community, and public receptors.  Currently considered potential changes and modifications include:\r\n- Addition of ammonia monitoring at the bulk tank area to immediately detect potential spills or releases; addition of ammonia monitoring on the roof at the exhaust locations of the Ipsen furnaces\r\n- Addition of high level sensor on ammonia storage tank to alert personnel of a potential over-filling condition\r\n- Addition of secondary containment around the ammonia storage tank to capture any ammonia releases from the tank\r\n- Addition of all ammonia monitoring equipment to backup power source to maintain full monitoring capability in the event of a power outage\r\n- Addition of a deluge system at the ammonia storage tank as an immediate response measure to a catastrophic release of ammonia to mitigate the vaporization of the chemical and potential exposures\r\n- Incorporation of a permanent marking system in the ammonia unloading area to prevent unauthorized personnel access and other delivery driver access to the area during an ammonia unload\r\n- Addition of in-line manual valves on ammonia distribution piping to allow for multiple locations of shutting off the ammonia supply in the event of an ammonia release\r\n\r\nThese changes will be reviewed by the ZF PSM and management teams for feasibility and need, and implemented as practical and necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Training - \r\nAwareness PSM/RMP Training\r\nEach employee (eith"
