      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPer the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Subpart G, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the March Point Cogeneration Company (MPCC) facility in Anacortes, Washington. \n\n1.1.  BACKGROUND\nMPCC owns a cogeneration plant near Anacortes, Washington on land leased by MPCC from the Shell Oil Products US Puget Sound Refinery (PSR), a co-located refinery.  Located within the cogeneration facility, a 20,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank (ammonia tank) is used to provide ammonia (a) to the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on the cogeneration plant\u00bfs gas combustion turbines and (b) to PSR for use in the refinery\u00bfs Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit Electrostatic Precipitator.  The ammonia tank is owned by MPCC.  It is located on property owned by PSR and leased to MPCC.  Previously, the ammonia tank was included in PSR\u00bfs RMP.  PSR has deleted the ammonia tank from PSR\u00bfs RMP.  MPCC has undertaken responsibility for the RMP for the ammonia tank.  \n\nCurrently MPCC has agreements in place with PSR to provide personnel to perform certain operation and maintenance services for MPCC.  These services that PSR provides include services related to implementation of the MPCC RMP, including emergency response services related to the ammonia tank, and implementation of the fourteen elements of the PSM (Process Safety Management) Plan for the ammonia tank.  PSR has included the ammonia tank in PSR\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan.\n\n1.2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nMPCC has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of MPCC processes."

      "SummaryText": "The policy of MPCC is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release from the ammonia tank does occur, MPCC has contracted with PSR to have PSR provide trained personnel to respond to, control and contain the release.\n \n1.3.  STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nMPCC\u00bfs cogeneration plant is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Located within this facility is a 20,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank; anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous under applicable RMP regulations by the EPA.  \n\nThe ammonia tank is used to provide anhydrous ammonia to the SCR systems on MPCC\u00bfs gas combustion turbines and to PSR, the co-located refinery, for use in PSR\u00bfs Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit Electrostatic Precipitator.  The ammonia tank is owned by MPCC.  It is located on property owned by PSR and leased to MPCC.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored or handled at this facility is 91,040 pounds based on an administrative control stating that the contents in the tank are not to exceed 80 percent of the ammonia tank\u00bfs storage capacity.\n\n1.4.  WORST-CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAccidental release modeling for a worst case and an alternative release scenario are required for the ammonia storage tank.  The worst-case scenario is used to determine off-site impacts from the worst-case accident during stable weather conditions, as dictated by the RMP regulations.  The alternative scenario establishes the off site impacts if a more realistic accident or an equipment failure were to occur under ordinary weather conditions.\n\nThe worst case and alternative scenarios are modeled using the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) dispersion model.   DEGADIS is used to determine the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint that is specified in the RMP regulations.  The toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia is 140 mg/m3.\n\n1.4.1."

      "SummaryText": "ON PROGRAM & \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMPCC has contracted PSR for assistance in implementing an accident prevention program and in complying with the PSM Standards.  MPCC is using the accident prevention program originally developed in PSR\u00bfs original RMP.  The original program, which applies to the whole of PSR, is summarized in Appendix A of this report for information purposes only.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, MPCC has safety features on the ammonia tank to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the process.\n\nRelease Detection\n\nAmmonia detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n2.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n3.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n4.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n5.  Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.  Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n2.  Sprinkler systems\n3.  Deluge system for specific equipment\n4.  Trained PSR emergency response personnel\n5.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n1.6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nMPCC has had no accidental releases from the ammonia tank system over the past 5 years.\n\n1.7.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nMPCC is exempt from the Emergency Response Program (40 CFR part 68.95) because it meets the exemption requirements detailed in 40 CFR part 68.90 paragraph (b), which states that:\n\nThe owner or operator of stationary source whose employees will not respon"

CAER has prepared a community Emergency Response Plan in accordance with EPA\u00bfs RMP requirements, and continues to work in cooperation with government organizations including the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This community Emergency Response Plan includes the ammonia tank.  In addition, MPCC does not possess any regulated flammable substances held in a process above the RMP threshold quantity.  Finally, MPCC has contracted with PSR to provide emergency response services for the ammonia tank and has established the appropriate mechanisms to notify PSR emergency responders whenever there is a need for a response.  PSR accordingly has a written Emergency Response Plan that incorporates all emergencies related to the ammonia tank and that satisfies the conditions of 40 CFR part 68.95.  MPCC meets all of the conditions from 40 CFR 68.90 (b), and therefore, an Emergency Response Plan is not included as part this report.*  \n \n1.8.

      "SummaryText": "WORST-CASE SCENARIO\nIn accordance with the RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario assumes that the contents of the ammonia tank are released over a 10-minute period.  The ambient air temperature is set to 304 K (88\u00b0F), which is the maximum high temperature measured in the last three years based on the representative data in accordance with the RMP regulations.   A surface roughness of 0.5 m is used, which corresponds to a rural area with various vegetation and numerous obstacles.  The release rate, 69 kilograms per second (kg/s) (9104 pound per minute (lb/min)), is determined by assuming that the entire contents of the ammonia tank are emitted at a continuous rate for a 10-minute period.  The release temperature is the boiling point of ammonia at 239.8 K (-28\u00b0F).  The release radius is estimated assuming a spherical volume of a 1-minute release.  The worst-case scenario is simulated as a ground level type release.  The endpoint distance for the worst-case scenario is 1.50 miles (2.4 kilometers (km)).\n\n1.4.2.  ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS\nThe alternative scenario assumes that the pipe between the truck fill connection and the tank is severed and that ammonia escapes below the tank.  The release duration for this alternative is set at 60 minute.  The ambient air temperature is set at 283 K (51\u00b0F) to simulate a \u00bftypical\u00bf day in Anacortes.   A surface roughness of 0.5 m is used, which corresponds to a rural area with bushes and numerous obstacles.  This alternative scenario does not consider mitigation effects from the dike or the sprinkler/deluge systems.  The release rate is calculated using ALOHA.   The release radius of 1 m is an engineering estimate that considers that the ammonia plume released from the pipe will expand as it travels around the bottom of the tank and into the atmosphere.  This alternative scenario is simulated as a ground type release.  The endpoint distance for the alternative scenario is 0.84 miles (1.3 km).\n\n1.5.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTI"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  Through the BEST (Behavioral Education for a Safer Today) Program, employees have designed and implemented a behavior based safety program which encourages modifications to behavior to work safer.  This program utilizes peer observations of work practices and participation on safety teams.  The program has the stated goal that \u00bfWe all return home healthy and safe.\u00bf  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.

      "SummaryText": "Puget Sound Refinery.  March Point Cogeneration has adopted Puget Sound Refinery\u00bfs operating procedures.  Puget Sound Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary by Puget Sound Refinery (Operator) to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTRAINING\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company provides additional technical training for Puget Sound Refinery operators specific to the power generation equipment and machinery.  The Operations at the March Point Cogeneration Facility additionally comply with the Puget Sound Refinery\u00bfs training requirements.  To complement the written procedures for process operations, Puget Sound Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  There is a training program that is designed to provide new operators with basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After attending the training program, new operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties to perform the duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to help maintain their skills and knowledge.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nMarch"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Puget Sound Refinery and March Point Cogeneration Company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of contractor.  Refinery and March Point Cogeneration Company personnel periodically monitor various contractor\u00bfs safety performance to confirm that such contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRS)\nMarch Point Cogeneration Company and the Puget Sound Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention p"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to a variety of departments for consideration and resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and that documentation is retained.  It is Puget Sound Refinery\u00bfs and March Point Cogeneration Company\u00bfs policy to resolve all open findings in a timely manner.  The time necessary to resolve a finding varies, depending on the nature of the finding and circumstances.  For example, as a general rule, findings are resolved within two years or less, unless the resolution of the finding requires a unit or plant shutdown to complete, or other conditions limit the ability of the plant resolve the open finding.\n\nPuget Sound Refinery and March Point Cogeneration Company periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  An electronic tracking system is used to manage and document the results and findings from these updates.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nPuget Sound Refinery\u00bfs operations personnel operates the March Point Cogeneration Facilities inside the"
