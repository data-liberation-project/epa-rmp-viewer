BASF\u00c2\u00bfs objective is to minimize the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and, if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to BASF\u00c2\u00bfs employees, the public, and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating practices, providing appropriate training to all employees, complying with pertinent codes and regulations, and proactively planning and coordinating emergency response activities with BASF\u00c2\u00bfs local emergency response providers.\n\nBASF\u00c2\u00bfs management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n2\tFacility Description\n\nBASF manufactures petroleum catalysts, including fluid cracking and moving bed catalysts, for sale to oil refineries.  As part of this process, BASF uses ammonia for pH control in various applications in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, \u00c2\u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\u00c2\u00bf  BASF has one 12,000-gal ammonia storage tank.  \n\n3\tGeneral Chemical Accident Prevention Program and Ammonia-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBASF is governed by a set of MSHA and EPA (and corresponding Georgia) regulations that require a number of activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous materials, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the facility\u00c2\u00bfs employees, the public, and the environment.

Key concepts of this program include periodic Process Hazard Analyses (PHA), up-to-date operations and maintenance procedures and training, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review processes, periodic compliance audits and incident investigations, and employee participation in site safety processes.\n\n3.1\tProcess Hazard Analyses\n\nA multi-departmental team of BASF employees recently conducted an ammonia system Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in June 2009 using current Process Safety Information.  The PHA was designed to proactively identify and address any system weaknesses in order to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Items identified were documented and appropriate work orders submitted.  Procedures are in place to maintain this PHA consistent with the current ammonia process and to update and revalidate it at least every five years.\n\n3.2\tProcedures and Training\n\nIt is BASF\u00c2\u00bfs policy to ensure that its employees are provided clear instructions for safely conducting all work-related activities.  Accordingly, the ammonia"

Employees operating the ammonia system receive various forms of training in these SOPs and safe work practices to ensure that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties.\n\nIt is also BASF\u00c2\u00bfs policy to inspect, test, and maintain its process equipment in a manner consistent with applicable manufacturer\u00c2\u00bfs recommendations and recognized good engineering practices.  Accordingly, BASF has ammonia-related maintenance procedures addressing preventative maintenance and repairs, hot work permits, etc designed to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Maintenance mechanics and technicians receive appropriate training in these procedures to ensure that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties.  In addition, BASF works with its maintenance contractors to ensure that they are familiar with and meet or exceed all site safety standards and practices.\n\n3.3\tManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Review Processes\n\nBASF management recognizes that processes and equipment constantly change.  To ensure that these changes are managed and implemented safely, BASF has Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review processes in place to ensure that safety and health considerations and procedural and training requirements are addressed in conjunction with any change being implemented.\n\n3.4\tCompliance Audits and Incident Investigations\n\nBASF conducts routine audits of its ammonia accident prevention program to ensure the program\u00c2\u00bfs effectiveness and continuous improvement.  However, should an ammonia release occur, BASF has an Incident Investigation process designed to quickly identify root causes and appropriate actions to prevent future releases.  These investigations are reviewed regularly for trends, etc as a means of further managing the safety of BASF\u00c2\u00bfs manufacturing processes.\n\n3.5\tEmployee Participation \n\nBASF\u00c2\u00bfs ultimate goal"

Therefore, it is BASF\u00c2\u00bfs policy to contact offsite emergency responders for assistance in the event of an ammonia-related emergency. \nIn the event of a non-emergency ammonia release, BASF employees trained in the safe operation of the ammonia system will close automatic shutoff valves (and manual if these can be safely approached) to terminate the flow of ammonia.  \n\nFor all other scenarios, BASF\u00c2\u00bfs employees will evacuate the area as necessary and allow offsite responders \u00c2\u00bf in this case representatives of the Decatur County Emergency Management Agency and Decatur County Fire Department - to respond to the ammonia emergency.\n\n6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBASF is making changes to improve the safety of its ammonia system, including:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImproving its current mechanical integrity program\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUpgrading the ammonia distribution piping system\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUpgrading ammonia tank storage system\n\u00c2\u00bf\tRevising ammonia system drawings as necessary\n\nThese changes will be in place by December 2009."
