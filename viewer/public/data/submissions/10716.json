The facility has actively implemented all of the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard to review the safety of the processes that could pose a hazard to the employees and the public.  In addition to these standards, the facility has implemented the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection Chemical Accident Prevention regulations for the Assessment of Risk Through the Analysis of Hazards (ARTAH) for the processes. These regulations, standards, and policies define the manner in which the processes are maintained and inspected, operated, and modified.  They also define the manner in which the processes are evaluated for safe operation and the training of the personnel employed to operate and maintain the facility.  Safe Work Procedures are in place for hot work, lock-out/tagout, line break, and hot tap work to prevent accidental releases and to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\nIn the event that an accidental release were to occur, Coastal Chem, Inc. has established an Emergency Response Plan which is used to guide the response.  The facility has a well-trained emergency services team comprised of fire fighters, medical personnel, hazardous materials technicians, and rescue personnel.   Coastal Chem Inc is a member of the Lander County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The facility personnel have participated in training with the local emergency responders through tabletop exercises and response drills.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCoastal Chem, Inc. produces industrial chemicals and fertilizer products.  Finished products shipped from the facility are Ammonium Nitrate Liquid and Ammonium Nitrate Prills. These pro"

The complete failure of this storage tank was assumed to release 516,000 pounds of ammonia vapor over a 10-minute period.  No mitigation systems were considered in this release scenario.  The distance to an ERPG-2 endpoint (200-PPM) for this WCS is 4.90 miles.  This release scenario was modeled using the Det Norske Veritas\nPHAST Version 5.22 modeling software.\n\nThe alternate case release scenarios for Anhydrous Ammonia is a offloading line failure in the ammonia storage process.  This failure results in the release of 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in 60 minutes.  The release was assumed to be isolated by plant personnel within this time. The distance to an ERPG-2 endpoint (200-PPM) for this ARS is 0.20 miles. This release scenario was modeled using the Det Norske Veritas\nPHAST Version 5.22 modeling software.\n\nThe alternate case release scenarios for Chlorine is a hole in the 1-ton storage container in the Ammonia Process.  The hole results in the release of 1,500 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  The release was assumed to be isolated by plant personnel within this time. The distance to an ERPG-2 endpoint (3-PPM) for this ARS is 0.22 miles.  This release scenario was modeled using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Equation. \n\nFlammable Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable substance in the facility is a catastrophic failure of a propane storage tank in the propane offloading and storage process.   The complete failure of this storage tank was assumed"

No mitigation systems were considered in this release scenario.  The distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is .49 miles.  This release scenario was modeled using EPA's OCA Guidance Equations.\n\nThe alternate case scenario for flammable substance in the facility is a failure of a 3\" propane offloading line in the propane offloading and storage process. The scenario releases 7,500 pounds of propane, complete vaporization, and ignition resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The failure of this piping is assumed to go undetected for 5 minutes before being isolated by plant personnel.  The distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS is 0.16 miles. This release scenario was modeled using EPA's OCA Guidance Equations.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Action Steps\n\nA multi-faceted approach is used in the prevention of accidental releases in the facility. Equipment integrity is maintained by following proper design, fabrication, and installation, and maintenance practices and design codes.  Solid, well written operating procedures and training programs for personnel in the facility are used to prevent process upsets and equipment damage.   Continuous monitoring of the facility's processes is accomplished by both process operators and computer control to operate within equipment and process limitation.  Advisory alarms and emergency shutdown systems are designed and tested to automatically limit the potential for a release.  Year 2000 compliant software has been installed and tested for process monitoring and control computers. Incident investigations are used to learn the cause of both near misses and incidents so those corrective action steps may be implemented to prevent the future incidents.\n\nFollowing is a partial listing of chemical specific programs in the facility to prevent releases.

Chlorinators for delivery of chlorine to cooling water system, which automatically stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a break in the delivery tubing.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nCoastal Chem, Inc. has experienced a total of 3 accidents which meet the criteria for RMP reporting. One release in 1996 and one release in 1998 were reported to Federal and State agencies but presented no onsite or offsite consequences One release on March 4, 1999, resulted in the notification and response of offsite responders and the evacuation of one nearby resident as a precautionary measure.  The March 4, 1999, release resulted from loose adapter plate which is a part of the tank car liquid unloading valve, and is not equipment maintained by the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCoastal Chem, Inc. maintains a written emergency response program with procedures to address both large and small incidents.   The facility maintains a volunteer emergency services team with members trained as fire fighters, medical personnel, hazardous materials technicians, and rescue personnel.   Coastal Chem Inc is a member of the Lander County Emergency Planning Committee which conducts training exercises and coordinates the response to the community and facilities in the county.  The facility maintains a contract with a hazardous materials emergency response contractor to assist when needed.  The facility maintains an array of emergency response equipment and supplies.   Routine training for all personnel is held a necessary to perform their assigned response duties.\n\nP"
