This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other section of this RMPlan\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Blue Water Gas Plant, located 3 miles east of Morse, Louisiana, consists of one Program Level 1 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  The facility could contain regulated flammables (e.g., mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane), but no regulated toxic inventories, in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines.  The adjacent tank farm operation handles condensate and lube oil and is not considered part of the stationary source's covered process.  The plant is located in a rural area and surrounded by farmland.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternate Release Scenario (ARS)\nSpecifics concerning Offsite Consequence Analyses are contained in the RMPlan Data Element Sections 4 and 5.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release "

      "SummaryText": "Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Blue Water Gas Plant.  Because processes at the plant regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, the plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThe plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The OIMS contact at the plant is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in the operatin"

The plant ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a knowledge-based PHA Revalidation incorporating a What/If Checklist, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained"

The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an accept"

This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented for each employee.\n\nContractors\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to help ensure contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to their working in the plant which includes (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) applicable emergency provisions, and (4) information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with plant personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\n\nPlant personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs/performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and the plant supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a significant change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.
