Chlorine cylinders in use are on scales for daily measurement of chlorine consumption and for inventory purposes.  The building contains chlorine gas detection alarms.  Standard Operating Procedures and Emergency Operations Procedures are in place.  The Borough of Carlisle has delegated emergency response to the local fire department, Empire-Friendship Fire Companies, and with the county LEPC and HAZMAT Response Teams.  Carlisle is the county seat.  The LEPC Off-site Emergency Response Plan from SARA III is the de facto emergency response plan for the site.  Incident chain-of-command is listed in this document.  Furthermore, Water Department employees are trained in chlorine safety and in routine operations.  A Chlorine Institute \"B\" kit for repairing one-ton cylinders is located on-site at the water plant to allow for repair of one-ton cylinder leaks, as are SCBA and PPE for the workers.  Routine internal compliance audits will be performed on an annual basis.",

      "SummaryText": "A.        The Borough of Carlisle Municipal Authority owns a  potable water treatment system and distribution system for the Borough of Carlisle, county seat for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, and for some surrounding communities.  This system is operated by the Borough of Carlisle.  The water treatment plant located at 165 Long's Gap Road processes up to 7.0 million gallons per day of water drawn from the Conodoguinet Creek to yield potable water.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, fluoridation, and chlorine disinfection.  Chemicals are also added to control taste, odor, and corrosion.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, every day of the year.\n\n\n\nB.          The water treatment plant includes a chlorination room, which contains two (2) one-ton cylinders of chlorine liquified under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  The chlorinator system uses remote-vacuum-actuated feed lines and has high pressure regulators attached directly to the chlorine vessel gas valves, mitigating against high-pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory is 4,000 pounds.  The average operating inventory is 2,750 pounds.\n\n\n\nC.         The Borough of Carlisle Municipal Authority's water treatment plant accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n\n            1)  High level of training for the operators.\n\n            2)  Preventative maintenance program for equipment.\n\n            3)  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n            4)  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the  participation of the \n\n                 operators.\n\n            5)  Perform"

      "SummaryText": "ance of a hazard review of the equipment and procedures.\n\n            6)  Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA,) awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector.\n\n\n\nD.         No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nE.     The facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and coordinated by the Cumberland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Carlisle and by the Carlisle Fire and Rescue Services and the Cumberland County HAZMAT Response Team.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills have been conducted with the fire companies, and the operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\nF.         Changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were made following a February 4, 1999, inspection of the disinfection systems by the Borough's consulting engineer.  These recommendations included third-party training of all water plant employees in chlorine usage and safety, done on June 2, 1999, improvement to written emergency operating procedures, and the installation of a security system to prevent unauthorized entry. Third party chlorine training was repeated on November 19, 2002. The security system was improved and related training was provided in June 2002. Similar training is conducted annually. "
