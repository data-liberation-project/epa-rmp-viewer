      "SummaryText": "ne diisocyanate.\n\nThe 2,4-toluene diisocyanate storage process is determined to be Program 1.  The WCS for this process involves a spill of the largest 2,4-TDI storage tank at the St. Paul facility.  No administrative controls are in place to limit the quantity of 2,4-TDI stored in the largest tank, so the full tank inventory is assumed to spill and volatilize.  The maximum distance to the 0.007 mg/L endpoint does not reach a public receptor.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nhci Worum maintains Health, Safety and Environmental manuals, which contain company policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach and Hazard Communication among others.  The manuals also include Emergency Action Plans, Emergency Response Plans and Transportation Emergency Plans.  The facility is also in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\nThe hci Worum Chemical facility has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 years, no accidental releases have occurred that resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\n\nhci Worum Chemical Company has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Minnesota Emergency Response Commission.\n\nhci Worum continues to improve its safety record by conducting incident investigations, safety compliance audits, continuous traning of emergency procedures and continuous outreach actions which include:  educating and training neighbors, customers, fire departments and emergency response teams.  hci Worum practices continous training of emergency procedures through regular safety meetings and all incidents are thoroughly investigated and reviewed by the Facility Safety Committee."
