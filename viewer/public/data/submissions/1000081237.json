This\n\ncommitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program\n\naddresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with\n\nthe process equipment at the facility.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus Packing, LLC senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to\n\nmaintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees\n\nand the surrounding communities. Wonderful Citrus's safety and environmental policies as they\n\nrelate to the ammonia refrigeration systems are administered by the Manager of Technical Services,\n\nwho conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Rio Grande Juice Facility is located at 702 East Expressway 83, in Mission, TX, which is\n\non the south side of the expressway, between South Conway Avenue and Business Park Drive. The area\n\nimmediately surrounding the facility is Urban. The facility was constructed and began operations in\n\n1969.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Wonderful Citrus is processing and storage of citrus products. In order to\n\nconduct operations, the facility maintains two refrigeration systems containing a maximum of 18,800\n\npounds of ammonia, a regulated substance. The Main System contains a maximum of\n\n17,000 pounds of ammonia and the second (separate) Tank Area System that contains a maximum of 1800 pounds of\n\nammonia. The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia\n\nthrough various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high\n\npressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the\n\nprocessing and storage of citrus products. Typical operating conditions range from"

Much of the safety of\n\nthe system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For\n\nexample, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an\n\noutside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the\n\nInternational Mechanical Code, ANSI/IIAR 2, and ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15,\n\nwhich specifically outline requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThese safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine rooms as well as sensors in the cold\n\nrooms. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just\n\noutside of the engine rooms (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief\n\nvalves that are piped to an ammonia diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Rio Grande Juice has developed a preventive\n\nmaintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia\n\nrefrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems at Rio Grande Juice date to 1969.\n\nPreventative maintenance has been kept up throughout the last 5 years. Therefore, there have been\n\nno significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in\n\nthe past five years. In addition, there have been no injuries resu"

The Emergency Action Plan\n\n(Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.\n\n\n\nThis Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n 1. To save lives.\n\n 2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n 3. To protect the environment.\n\n 4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency\n\ncoordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification\n\nprocedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be\n\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan\n\nis reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure\n\ncompliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and\n\nactivate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation. If necessary, they will alert the local\n\nemergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency\n\nresponse efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted on July 30-31, 2013, including a Hazard and Operability\n\n(HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the\n\nWonderful Citrus facility. The Wonderful Citrus safety committee is planning to complete several\n\nitems over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their\n\nemployees. These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have e"
