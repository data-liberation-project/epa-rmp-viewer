Evacuation procedures are included in the emergency response plan.  Communication is provided through a specialized radio service, where Honeywell Hopewell can review the situation and coordinate directly with other emergency response agencies.  Direct 2-way radio links are in place to quickly notify local school systems and media sources.  \r\n\r\nHoneywell Hopewell has its own emergency response brigade made up of approximately 80 trained, qualified, certified emergency response individuals.  These responders receive additional training in chemical plant emergency response and many have been trained at nationally known emergency response schools in Texas and Nevada.  These plans and responses to incidents are tested annually through drills involving the brigade and local police, fire, rescue and other emergency service personnel. The brigade receives periodic training e.g., tabletop drills and hands-on exercises, throughout the year. \r\n\r\n(6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nHoneywell Hopewell strives to continually improve process safety at the site.  Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment.  Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents.  The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance.  \r\n\r\nAlso, Honeywell Hopewell benchmarks companies to achieve a higher level of safety, and comprehensive incident investigations enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents.  As one part of the investigation to"

      "SummaryText": "ol, we have trained about 180 salaried and hourly employees in root cause analysis, an investigative system designed to identify and correct the causes of equipment and procedural failures.  It is widely used to help improve our level of safety and environmental performance.\r\n\r\n\tManaging change is a key activities task associated with process safety and risk management.  Detailed procedural steps have been developed to provide guidance for operations personnel in making necessary process and mechanical changes to maintain a safe plant and achieve a high level of performance.  Multi-departmental approvals are required before proceeding with requested changes.  This management of change process incorporates:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess hazard analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating procedure updates\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical integrity review\r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup safety reviews\r\n\u00bf\tAudits to ensure that any process or mechanical change maintain safe performance\r\n\r\nIn addition, Honeywell Hopewell continues to make efforts to enhance safety and reduce risks through the identification and use of new management-of-change methodologies and tools and to utilize process hazard analysis for the processes and chemicals that are on the site."
