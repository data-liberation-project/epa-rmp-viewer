Specific responsibilities for maintaining this process safety information have been identified and assigned to qualified individuals.  The plant's hazard communication program communicates the health and environmental effects of chemicals to our employees.  We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of our processes.\n\n    Each chemical process is analyzed utilizing a method designed to identify, prevent and minimize the effects of hazards such as fire, chemical release, process control and explosions.  The utilization of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) techniques has been applied at Honeywell Hopewell for many years. The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their affects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\n\n    \n\n    Written operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of Honeywell Hopewell has specific operating procedures developed by people knowledgeable in the operation of that area, the operators and area supervisors.\n\n\n\n    Besides standard operating procedures, Honeywell Hopewell has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators.
