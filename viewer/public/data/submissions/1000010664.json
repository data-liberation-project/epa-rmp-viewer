Martinek Grain now only uses anhydrous ammonia for making liquid fertilizer (11-37-0) in a \"T\" reactor.  The ammonia comes in on a rail car or truck and is used in the process by the company that supplies the reactor.\n\nMears Fertilizer, Inc. P.O. Box 1271 ElDorado, KA 67042 (316)321-3674 react our fertilizer for us.\n\nFrom the time they arrive on site until they complete the process, they are responsible for the ammonia.  I have received the following letter from Mears:\n\n\"This is to certify that Mears does have a written plan which, to the best of our knowledge, meets the requirements of the fourteen (14) elements under 29 CFR Part 1910 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 CFR Part 68, Section 122(r).\nEach Mears' Mix Unit carries a PSM/RMP manuel; therefore, if you need to review our operating or mechanical integrity procedures, feel free to do so when our Units are on location.  Copies of our inspection and testing records for ammonia hose, pressure relief devices, and hard plumbing are also carried on the Units, or they can be obtained from this office.\"\n\nMartinek Grain has in place a plan to notify the Mears technicions when they arrive of the notification process in case of emergency in Celina.  We also notify both fire and police prior to their arrival that we will be reacting fertilizer.  Martinek relies on the RMP in place for Mears Fertilizer, Inc. while they are on site.\n\nFrom the time the rail car arrives, we have an employee that lives on site which watches the car.  We check the car for adequate safety devices, including locks and seals, to prevent tampering until Mears arrives.\n\nAt no time is the car opened or lines connected to the car until Mears arrives.\n\n\n\n\n"
