      "SummaryText": "Facility Name: Monson Fruit Company\n\nSelah, WA 98942\n\n \n\n\n\nRMP Executive Summary below:\n\n \n\nMonson Fruit Company (hereinafter called \"Monson\") has two large (over 10,000#) and one small ammonia refrigeration system to quickly chill, pack and store under controlled atmosphere a variety of fruit products. The systems have a computerized process control system that monitors system performance and controls its operation.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in this system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. It is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\n\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public, and the environment, the Monson facility has an integrated process safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.  The program is designed to comply with WISHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nThe Monson plant has an emergency action plan that addresses the response procedures necessary for a release of anhydrous ammonia from a refrigeration system.  Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected.  The refrigeration systems are designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Selah police and fire departments and to the Yakima County emergency services to assist in the response. \n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia. Should there be an accidental release when no one was on the premises, it would be"

      "SummaryText": " detected by a computer control system.  Ammonia leak detectors are installed and the computer checks all areas where ammonia could possibly be.  When the computer detects ammonia it turns on the alarm and dials emergency numbers for appropriate refrigeration personnel. \n\n\n\nMonson makes daily inspections of the ammonia refrigeration systems to determine if there are any potential problems; in addition, a preventive maintenance program is in place and inspections, tests and maintenance are completed by qualified site and contractor ammonia refrigeration technicians.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the revision of the Process Safety Management Plans for Refrigeration Systems 1, 2, & 3 and the Risk Management Plan for Refrigeration Systems 1 & 3,all aspects of the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems have been reviewed and approved by the PSM Committee.
