It is the WCF\u00bfs policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility.  As part of this policy, the WCF has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the WCF and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at WCF.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Woodhaven Cavern Facility.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWCF has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and contractors and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility.  WCF utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.\n\nIn the event of a release, as a non-responding facility, WCF personnel are instructed to dial  911 to notify the Woodhaven Fire Department via telephone to respond and to mitigate the release.  WCF has coordinated emergency response to the facility with the Woodhaven Fire Department.

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Findlay Region Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the Findlay Region organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the WCF process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Northeast Area Manager, along with responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan.  Technical support for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan was assigned to Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC\u00bfs, WCF Operations Supervisor.  The Findlay Region\u00bfs emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the MAPL Findlay Region Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone\u00bfs job, many other WCF personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2 WCF Regulated Substances\n\nWCF is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility with six underground solution-mined storage caverns and five above ground storage vessels.  The storage caverns are used to store flammable mixtures, primarily butane and propane, for use in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC\u00bfs Michigan Refining Division, Detroit Refinery, or for LPG truck sales.  The flammable mixtures are covered under the RMP rule and are present at the WCF above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nWCF has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMAPL performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an acciden"

The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  MAPL does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like WCF. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC and Woodhaven Fire Department improve the community emergency response plan.  We have submitted release scenarios to EPA, and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  Local residents and businesses who are interested in learning more about WCF's risk management plan should contact the Woodhaven  Cavern Facility at (734) 676-7775 and ask for the Woodhaven Operations Supervisor.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Woodhaven Cavern Facility. Because processes at the WCF that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the WCF, where necessary, to satisfy EPA\u00bfs Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWCF encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of  WCF\u00bfs accident prevention pr"

In addition, WCF has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include teams which promote both process and personal safety, such as the monthly Safety and Operations Meetings with management and hourly employees.  Management groups typically have members with various areas of expertise, including operations, maintenance, and management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWCF keeps a variety of technical documents at the WCF that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific WCF Operations personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the WCF Operations Manual to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, WCF has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the WCF Operations Manual. WCF ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nWCF also maintains numerous technical docume"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nWCF has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nWCF primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA report is forwarded to the MAPL Findlay Region Manager to review and approve.

The PHA Team has considered offsite effects of potential releases as part of all PHA updates completed after August, 1996.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWCF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed by a designated group of operations personnel and annually certified by the Woodhaven Operations Supervisor as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the WCF operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to the on-duty WCF Operator and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operation, WCF has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the Woodhaven Cavern Facility.  New employees receive orientation training, which includes, but is not limited to, the following topics:  Process Overview, Employee Involvement, General Safety Rules, Safe Work Permit, Lockout/Tagout, Blinding and Line Breaking, and the Safe Handling of LPG.  After successfully completing this training, a WCF Operator Trainee is paired with a quali"

After trainees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, the trainee\u00bfs performance and knowledge are reviewed by qualified WCF Operators and a vote is taken to determine if he/she is qualified to operate the Woodhaven Cavern Facility.\n\nIn addition, all WCF Operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nWCF uses contractors at the WCF to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, WCF has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform WCF personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.  In addition, WCF evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  WCF personnel periodically monitor contractor performance"

The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWCF has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

WCF incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nWCF has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWCF has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to WCF management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, WCF periodically conducts audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  These audits may be led by a third party contractor with assistance by WCF employees as required.  The findings are forwarded to WCF management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are complete.
