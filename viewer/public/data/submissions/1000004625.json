To be an effective program it requires a systematic approach to evaluate the whole chemical process.  Using this approach, the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process are all considered in this evaluation.  Through this evaluation we intend to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic chemicals as these releases could result in toxic hazards and cause harm to persons or the environment.\n\nApplication:\n\n This RMP pertains to the Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation's Ethanol Facility located in Sedgwick County, Colwich, KS.

This procedure is meant to prevent a possible catastrophic event.\n\nTo define change we are including all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\"\n\nThese changes will be properly managed by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementing them.  For example, the operating procedures contain the operating parameters (pressure limits, temperature ranges, flow rates, etc.) and the importance of operating within these limits.  While the operator must have flexibility to maintain safe operation within the established parameters, any operation outside of these parameters requires review and approval by a written management of change procedure.\n\nManagement of change also covers changes in process technology and changes to equipment and instrumentation.  A change in process technology can result from changes in raw materials, experimentation, new equipment, new product development, and changes in operating conditions to improve yield or quality.\n\nEquipment changes can be in materials of construction, equipment specifications, piping pre-arrangements, experimental equipment, computer program revisions, and alarms and interlocks.
