Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Farmer's Coop Elevator of Blairsburg, IA (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and propane are stored at the facility in four storage tanks; ammonia 12,000 gallons and 26,000 gallons; propane 18,000 gallons and 24,000 gallons.\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 110,500 pounds for ammonia and 75,480 pounds for propane. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. \n    Anhydrous Ammonia- The maximum quantity released would be 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.43 miles. \n\n        Propane- The maximum quantity released would be 75,480 pounds.  The                 distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure)is 0.4 miles. \n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.  Th"

The active             mitigation devices are assumed to function as designed, would be 60 pounds.  The         distance to the end point (point of 1psi overpressure ) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet. \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia. The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.   The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five     years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;     nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in     place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Per"
