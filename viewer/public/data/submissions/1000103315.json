The Hambone Gas Processing Plant has not had any accidents within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Hambone Gas Processing Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. In an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMP Program and/or the facility will be implemented as identified. These improvements may be identified either as risk reduction measures during the PHA or as a result of an improved RMP Program."

      "SummaryText": "Information\n\nThe Hambone Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel and emergency response organizations in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hambone Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Conecuh County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The facility has around-the-clock communications capability. Gas Processors, Inc. operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Brooklyn Volunteer Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated su"

Safe operating procedures are implemented at the plant to help ensure that equipment is operated in a safe, and environmentally sound manner.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Hambone Gas Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The facility has existing safety features in place to assist with the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.  Specialized safety features are further discussed in the subsequent sections.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Hambone Gas Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.\tTanks are gauged\n2.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n3.\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\n4.\tContinuous monitoring H2S detectors located at strategic points in the facility\n5.\tOn call personnel available 24 hours per day.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.\tBerms around atmospheric tanks\n2.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels/tanks from rupturing\n3.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n4.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n5.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation \n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.\tTrained emergency response personnel\n2.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n3.\tSPCC Plan\n4.\tFire extinguishers\n\nEmergency Response Program"

      "SummaryText": "Gas Processors, Inc., owner and operator of the Hambone Gas Processing Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Gas Processors, Inc.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Hambone Gas Processing Plant is located in Conecuh County, Alabama. Natural gas is gathered from wells located within the greater Little Creek/Brooklyn production area and sent to the facility for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen (N2), natural gas liquids (NGLs) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before companies will purchase this gas. \n\nThe Hambone Gas Processing Plant has the capability to process up to 9.5 MMSCFD of natural gas and consists of the following; inlet gas compression, a condensate stabilizer unit, amine treating, a sulfa treat unit, ethylene glycol system, NGL recovery, as well as all other associated utilities such as fuel gas, methanol and instrument air. Waste water, condensate and NGLs are trucked from the site and sales gas is sent to pipeline.\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\nGas Processors, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are discussed in"
