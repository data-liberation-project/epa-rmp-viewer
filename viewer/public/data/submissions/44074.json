It is also our policy to work with the outside community and emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the event that a process incident occurs at the facility.\n\nThe primary activity of the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is municipal wastewater treatment.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 12 tons.\n\nWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios have not changed since the Risk Management Program was adopted five years ago.  The WWTP has an active Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Program.  There have been no accidents (significant releases) in the last 5 years and a Process Hazard Analysis was performed in June of 2009 where a what/if checklist technique was used during this analysis.\n"
