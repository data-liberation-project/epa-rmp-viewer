Vernon, LLC (\"SABIC\") has a long-standing history of commitment and performance of safe operations, while providing economic stability to the region as Posey County's largest employer. To that end, we have developed an extensive program to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. We operate under Process Safety Management guidelines, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily control methods and behaviors.\nProtecting the environment and the safety and health of employees and persons on the Company\u0092s premises is required by law. But at SABIC, we believe we should do even more as our part of our commitment to the environment, our employees, and persons at our premises and communities. Through management leadership and employee commitment, we must all work together to conduct our operations in a safe manner that minimizes adverse environmental impacts and helps prevent injuries and accidents. We are committed to being a world leader in environment, health and safety performance. We recognize that to do otherwise would weaken the economic foundation on which our community is built. \nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (812) 833-1361.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nSABIC is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority everywhere we do business.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \nTo provide top-quality products for our customers, the manufacturing processes at the Mt.

While we strive for 100 percent compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments used to manage and maintain safe operations with these materials, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements.  Our operating practices and procedures, along with our automated control systems, ensure all steps are taken to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\nIn the unlikely event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade, medical, and chemical emergency response teams staffed with SABIC personnel who have collectively committed thousands of hours to training. Many of these individuals are so committed to emergency response that they serve on their community fire and emergency response departments as well. As a result, they devote much of their personal time to additional drills, training and community response.\nEffective maintenance and implementation of such a contingency plan relies on strong cooperation with the community's emergency response teams. We consistently network with other emergency response providers in our county, as well as those in neighboring counties.  SABIC employees are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Ohio River Emergency Coop(OREC), and Posey County Fire Chiefs Association(PCFC).\nThese alliances ensure that we'll be able to quickly activate and depend on internal, as well as external, emergency response resources should the need ever arise.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe SABIC plant is the largest fully integrated polycarbonate facility in the world, sitting on a 1,000+-acre tract along the Ohio River, about two miles south of the city of Mt. Vernon, Indiana.  It was built in 1960 and currently employs 850 people in the Southern Indiana area.  SABIC manufactu"

Our products are used in a vast array of applications, including the automotive, medical, electronics, construction, computer, and appliance industries. \nUnlike most plastics manufacturing locations, the Mt. Vernon site houses three separate businesses, including support services and research. The site is the headquarters to three of the SABIC Innovative Plastics business units, as well as the Mt. Vernon Technology Department, where scientists and engineers work on the cutting edge of plastics innovation, developing materials and applications for new products and plastics manufacturing processes. \nThe Mt. Vernon plant uses four chemicals that are regulated under EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: Phosgene, a regulated toxic substance; Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance; Nitric acid (concentration 80% or greater), a regulated toxic substance; and Ammonia (anhydrous), a regulated toxic substance.\nPhosgene, chlorine, and 80+% nitric acid are raw materials used to manufacture our products.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our manufacturing process.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nSABIC complies with a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). The programs ensure that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. The programs satisfy the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\nSome of the many, specific safety features in place to prevent a chemical accident include:\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\u0095\tSafety procedures that reduce the potential for human error, which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\u0095\tSecondary containment dikes"

      "SummaryText": "5, in partnership with local industry and response organizations, SABIC introduced Advisory Liaison Emergency Readiness Team group (ALERT) siren system in the city of Mt. Vernon and the surrounding area. The five-siren system can be heard more than 4 miles from the center of town.  Though we have never had to activate the sirens on an emergency basis because of an event at SABIC, the siren system is available to warn the public in the unlikely event of a major incident. The system has continued to grow over the years, and further enhances the area's emergency preparedness specifically in the area of severe weather alerts.\nSABIC personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for the local community.  In addition, they are members of the Posey County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as well as belonging to many local emergency response teams. The site Emergency Response and Security Manager has more than 24 years of experience of Emergency Response/Preparedness and security initiatives.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY  \nSABIC is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Mt. Vernon facility.  Already identified in the ongoing effort to improve safety and emergency response are:  \n\u0095\tImplementation of high integrity instrumented safety systems based on Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) for high-risk critical systems.\n\u0095\tFacility Siting Assessments of occupied buildings to identify areas of highest risk to on-site personnel and options to reduce that risk.\n\u0095\tImplementation of Inherently Safer Design reviews in future Process Hazards Analysis."
