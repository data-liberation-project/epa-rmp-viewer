ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt this Wal-Mart Distribution Center (D.C.), we utilize anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Wal-Mart strives to protect all of its valuable resources and assets \u00c2\u00bf both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Clarksville Fire Department and the Johnson County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all effected neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGUALTED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration and freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 47,082 pounds.  We have the capacity for more, but our policy is to not exceed the IIAR recommendations of 80%.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": ") AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be a release of 12,321 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are release as a two-phase flow (gas and aerosol \u00c2\u00bf ALOHA).\nDistance to endpoint: 1.5 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be a release of approximately 1,039 pounds of ammonia.\nDistance to endpoint: 0.08 miles (or 145 yards)\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTo date, this Wal-Mart D.C. facility has not incurred a reportable release.\n\n5. THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Maintenance Manager will handle the management of the RMP program.  He/She will administrate in conjunction with the Wal-Mart D.C. management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Johnson County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Clarksville Fire Department.\n\n6. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Wal-Mart D.C. facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our written programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OJT) training.  They are given written and oral tests and are observed and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standards of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\n\n7. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis Wal-Mart D.C. has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions.  We have monthly meetings as well as an annual certification.  This helps to"

We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCurrently, this Wal-Mart D.C. trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our total ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated at least annually.  Our program is improved continually through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available.\n\nWal-Mart utilizes training programs from IIAR as well as RETA training protocol for their refrigeration technicians.  The programs consist of classroom training, viewing various training / safety videos and written testing procedures.  The training will be conduced on at least an annual basis."
