The Safety Manager for the BC Systems equipment ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has established emergency procedures and coordinates with the local site management and Fire Department to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, which include response to emergencies related to the ammonia refrigeration system covered by this RMP. The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n1.2. Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe equipment covered by this RMP is located at the Crown Cooling facility at 33 Malan St, Brawley, California. The facility is a third-party refrigerated warehouse that provides short-term storage for raw produce. \n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  The portable ammonia refrigeration system - RC-9 - is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 1,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nDue to the seasonal nature of the operation, the cooling unit is moved to the site and is operational from December to March, every year.  From April to November, the cooling unit and associated ammonia charge are located at an alternate BC Systems facility.\n\n1.3. Release Scenarios\n\nFor the portable cooler, one worst-case and one alternative-case scenario were analyzed.  \n\nWorst Case \n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of RC-9 (a maximum of 1,700 lbs) No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.7 miles.\n\nAlternate Case \n\nThe alternat"

      "SummaryText": "ive release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a pressure relief device.  The volume of RC-9 was used for the release calculations for a maximum of 1,700 lbs.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.2 mile.\n\n1.4. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBC Systems prevents accidental ammonia releases by using industry-accepted practices in the system design, build, modification, operation and maintenance phases. This includes:\n\n? Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\n? Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHA's) at least once every five years using accurate Process  Safety  Information\n\n? Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA\n\n? Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel  \n\n? Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations  and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs\n\n? Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols\n\n? Use of qualified contractors for work on the system.\n\n1.5. Five Year Accident History\n\nBetween October 2007 and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. However, the following ammonia-related incidents occurred at other BC Systems locations:\n\n?    Salinas, CA. RC-4 March 2012:  The flex portion of a 1 1/4\" ammonia liquid line was damaged.  While no liquid had escaped, a vapor excursion was visible & detected. The flex line was replaced at that time. \n\n?    Salinas, CA. RC-4 April 2012:  There"

      "SummaryText": " were two minor vapor releases due to malfunctioning valves. One release was caused by a malfunctioning solenoid and the other was caused by coil corrosion and seal damage. \n\n1.6. Emergency Response Program\n\nBC Systems has trained personnel in emergency response team (ERT) to address site emergencies in general as well as ammonia-specific emergencies.  Employees follow emergency response procedures established and reviewed by the BC Systems Environmental, Health and Safety department and maintenance staff, including those that are expert in the ammonia refrigeration systems.  In the event of an incident, the BC Systems will coordinate efforts with Crown Cooling and the Brawley Fire Department in order to provide adequate and appropriate response to an ammonia release.  \n\nThe Emergency Response procedures are maintained on site; copies can be found in the Safety Manager's files. Emergency Response procedures outline steps to be followed during emergency scenarios, including the mitigation of hazardous material releases, agency notification procedures in the event of a hazardous material release, and emergency equipment available at the site. \n\n1.7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nActions to reduce the potential for deviation or hazard and improve the robustness of the management system were reviewed during this PHA. No actions were identified.  Any comments are listed in the \"Comments and Actions\" section of the PHA Summary Tables. \n\nBased on the October 2012 PHA, any possible action items have been addressed via prior PHA's or through corrective actions stemming from prior incidents.  For this RMP, there were no additional action items assigned. \n\n"
