As a facility that will not respond to uncontrolled releases, the emergency response measures primarily include the safe evacuation of all personnel and notification to outside emergency responders.  Incidental releases that do not pose an imminent safety hazard may be abated by employees or contractors who are trained to provide such a response, are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), are authorized by Dot Foods to perform such activities, and are in the area of the release at the time of discovery.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n1.\tMinor modification to the Standard Operating Procedures.\n2.\tMinor modifications to the Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID).\n3.

The Thermosiphon Receiver also supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver, which then supplies liquid to the High Temperature Recirculator for recirculated liquid cooling to the Evaporator coils.  As the liquid ammonia leaves the High Temperature Recirculator, an expansion valve reduces the temperature and pressure of the liquid to the coils to maintain a pre-determined pressure.\n\nLiquid ammonia from the High Temperature Recirculator is supplied to the Low Temperature Recirculator through an expansion valve, which maintains the vessel at a lower pressure.  Liquid from the High Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the Truck Dock Evaporators and optionally to the Convertible Evaporators when high temperature cooling is desired in that space.   Liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the Freezer Evaporators and optionally to the Convertible Evaporators when low temperature cooling is desired in that space.\n\nPrior to entering the Evaporator coils, the ammonia expands and flashes to saturation temperature as the pressure is reduced through the respective expansion valves.

The refrigeration system is used to maintain cooling and freezing for warehouse products.  The refrigeration system began operation in March 1998 and was designed and constructed under the applicable fire and mechanical codes.\n\nThe system is a single-stage, multi-suction, economized mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes recirculated liquid feed to the evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for the 35\u00b0F Refrigerated Dock and Refrigerated Warehouse and for the -2\u00b0F Freezer Warehouse.  There are two rooms adjacent to the Freezer Warehouse, each with two (2) evaporator coil units that can be converted to/from refrigerated or frozen space.
