In 2003, after all ownership merged into one owner entity called  \u00bfOrmesa, LLC\u00bf, Ormat Nevada began operation of the Ormesa Geothermal Projects to generate electricity from renewable geothermal resources.  The Ormesa Geothermal Projects were formerly known as the East Mesa Geothermal Projects and are designated as EPA Facility ID Number 1000 0016 5251.\n\nThe Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code of the Ormesa facility is 4911 and the equivalent North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 221119.  Ormat Nevada, Inc. operates the Ormesa Geothermal Project in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  Ormesa has emergency response procedures and protocol in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.  \n\nThe facility consists of six independent geothermal power plants known as the Ormesa Geothermal Projects, and are comprised of  four Binary Geothermal Power Plants designated as Ormesa Geothermal I (OGI), Ormesa Geothermal IE (OGIE), Ormesa Geothermal II (OGII), Ormesa Geothermal IH (OGIH) and a Dual Flash Geothermal Power plant designated as GEM 2&3 (GEM 2&3 are operated as one combined power plant).  The OGI, OGIE, OGII, and OGIH power plants use isopentane, which is listed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as flammable material, and chlorine, an OSHA- and EPA-designated toxic substance, in quantities that exceed the threshold limits of the Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Because the processes at these units are functionally identical, however, this combined plan in applicable to all four facilities. \n\nEach of the four physically separate facilities is covered by the PSM and RMP regulations, which requires proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes procedures, or equipment.  The PSM/RMP regulations also define the responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects or takes place near processes covered by the regulations to ensure the safety of both plant and contractor employees and the potential effects on public receptors (RMP only).\n\nThe primary chemicals used at each facility that are covered by PSM/RMP regulations are isopentane and chlorine gas.  In the binary process of electrical generation, Isopentane is used as the motive fluid in the generation of electricity from natural geothermal fluid in a series of interconnected Ormat Energy Converters (OECs) at each facility.  Geothermal fluid is used to heat isopentane liquid to vapor in the OEC, which in turn is used as the motive fluid to spin a turbine connected to a generator to produce electricity.  The isopentane vapor is then condensed and reused in a continuous, closed loop process within each OEC that does not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the isopentane. At each facility, isopentane is also stored in one or more storage tanks.\n\nChlorine is used in the water treatment system to inhibit bacterial growth in the cooling towers.  The water from the cooling towers is used to condense the isopentane vapor into a liquid during the generation of electricity.  Makeup water for the cooling tower is obtained from a nearby irrigation canal.  At each facility, chlorine gas is stored in one or more 1-ton cylinders.  \nThe GEM 2 &"

The nearest publicly used or accessible area is the Desert Hot Springs recreation area at the southern boundary of the facility, approximately three miles from the nearest isopentane and chlorine storage tanks. \n\nAn integral element of the PSM/RMP is the process hazard analysis of the storage and use of isopentane and chlorine gas.  In 1994 and 1997, a process hazard analysis was performed using the Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) study in accordance with the guidelines of OSHA and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.  The previous HAZOP analysis for isopentane concluded that potential deviations could be categorized as \u00bfacceptable with appropriate controls\u00bf or \u00bfacceptable as is\u00bf and identified appropriate response procedures to use in the remote likelihood of occurrence.  A supplemental \u00bfWhat If\u00bf analysis was also performed at that time.\n\nAs part of the 5-year review, the previous HAZOP analysis was updated, including the \u00bfwhat-if\u00bf checklists, where appropriate.

Although such a release event is highly unlikely or not reasonably expected to occur at the site, EPA requires an evaluation of such a specific worst case event.  The level of significance for the worst case event has been established by the EPA as \u00bfthe one psi overpressure endpoint\u00bf, which is defined as the area whereby the pressure is one pound per square inch (psi) greater that normal atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi) for isopentane as a flammable gas, and the chlorine gas concentration is equal to or higher that the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) concentration of 10 parts per million (ppm). \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of concern for the worst-case event for isopentane release is estimated to be 0.2 miles; i.e., the area potentially affected by such a worst-case release is limited to a radius of less than 1/5 mile from the tank.  Within this radius of impact, however, there are no known public receptors at this time. \n\nFor a worst-case event of chlorine release, the distance to the endpoint of concern is estimated to be 1.5 miles, or the area potentially affected by such a worst-case release is limited to a radius of less than 1.5 miles from the tank.  Similarly, there are no known public receptors within this radius of effect. Therefore, the worst-case release event, while extremely improbable, would have no impact on public receptors.  \n\nOrmesa Geothermal Projects has complied with the PSM/RMP requirements and is committed to reviewing and enhancing the program periodically as appropriate and maintaining compliance with the regulatory program requirements.
