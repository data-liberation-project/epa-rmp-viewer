We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility is a food distribution warehouse which uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Perishables are kept in the cooler sections.  Frozen food items are kept in the freezer sections.  The anhydrous ammonia we use as a refrigerant is a chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nToxics\n\nCurrently, we have approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on site in our refrigeration system.  Under most conditions, ammonia is a toxic chemical (see Flammables). \n\nFlammables\n\nAmmonia has an NFPA Fire Hazard Rating of 1 (slight).  In the presence of an ignition source, ammonia is flammable in air at concentrations between 16% and 25%.  Also"

      "SummaryText": ", ammonia in combination with lubricating oil may be flammable at lower concentrations, depending on the amount of oil dispersed in the ammonia. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us manage effectively the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of this chemical.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and at least one alternative release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAnhydrous ammonia falls under Risk Management Program 3 requirements since our site is also covered by provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119, OSHA's process safety management standard.  Ammonia is regulated a a toxic chemical.  Failure of our largest ammonia vessel would be the worst case scenario for our facility.  Mitigating the potential effects of such a scenario is the location of the receiver inside our building.  In a worst case scenario, approximately 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a pressurized gas could be released indoors in 10 minutes.   Exhaust fans would move the vapor out of the building.  \n\nTo estimate possible offsite consequences of this release, we used the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance document (May 24, 1996) integrated in RMPlanner v. 2.0 (lookup tables) software developed by ABS Risk & Reliability Division (formerly JBF Associates) of Knoxville, TN.  According to the look-up tables, a 4,000-pound, indoor release could reach receptors 0.81 miles (4,280 feet) from the plant before dispersing enough not to pose a significant hazard (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm ammonia) to the public.  In 1990, based on the 1990 U.S. Census and LandView III mapping"

Adoption of a process safety management program [29 CFR 1910.119]\nd.

Within that distance are unrestricted public parking areas, residences, businesses, a school and the Anoka County airport . Wetlands in the Rice Creek Watershed District also lie within this area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario for our facility is based on a more likely event than the worst case scenario.  We have assumed a relief valve opens (lifts) and the release goes undetected for 10 minutes before employees manually isolate the problem.  Relief valves are piped to a header (pipe) which vents outdoors above the roof.  The potential release of 600 pounds of ammonia gas results in a distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm) at 0.19 miles (1,000 feet).  This distance was also determined using the EPA OCA lookup method mentioned in the paragraph above.  There were approximately 790 people living within that distance of our facility according to he 1990 U.S. Census for Anoka and Ramsey counties together with LandView III mapping software from the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
