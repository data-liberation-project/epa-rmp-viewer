As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Tri-Boro Fruit Company has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Company, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Tri-Boro Fruit Company has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Tri-Boro Fruit Company business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Tri-Boro Fruit Company employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Co. is a commercial cold storage facility for table grapes, citrus products, cherries, and dried fruit.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to two (2) precool rooms, three (3) cold storage rooms, a staging room, and a hallway. The precool and cold storage rooms utilize bunker mounted evaporators while the staging room and dock area utilize ceiling suspended evaporators.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to a thermosyphon vessel and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel"

      "SummaryText": " is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system was rebuilt in 1998.  More recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n? 2013 - California Controlled Atmosphere retrofitted the refrigeration system controls\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of pipe, valves, equipment, and vessels which are interconnected.  Therefore, the refrigeration system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nGENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Company has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an ac"

The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Tri-Boro Fruit Company facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Company has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION and RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Company's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n- California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n- Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Company has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall "

This has improved Tri-Boro Fruit Company's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Tri-Boro Fruit Company's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nTri-Boro Fruit Company has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Tri-Boro Fruit Company has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Tri-Boro Fruit Company now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Tri-Boro Fruit Company employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Tri-Boro Fruit Company will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
