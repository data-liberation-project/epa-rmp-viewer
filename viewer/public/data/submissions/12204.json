This commitment is demonstrated by the  resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.   If, in spite of all precautions, a  release does occur, Grant Chemical's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGrant Chemical manufactures, processes and store specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana and evaluated the facility to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, Grant Chemical identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The facility uses five regulated substances in four separate processes.  The chemicals and largest quantity on site (either as largest quantity in a single process or total quantity of mixtures) are: acetaldehyde (37,000 lbs); ethyl chloride (74,000 lbs); formaldehyde (60,000 lbs); methyl chloride (220,000 lbs); and phosphorus tricloride (88,000 lbs).\n\nIn addition, Grant Chemical is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869).  Therefore, the four Grant Chemical processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (i.e., 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables"

      "SummaryText": "assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.    The distances to the endpoint of 1 psi over pressure for the worst-case release of ethyl chloride using the EPA lookup table is 0.25 miles.\n\nToxic Substances:      Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the three regulated toxic substances at Grant Chemical was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  Based on the EPA lookup tables, a worst-case release of methyl chloride results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 3 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: \ta release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for ethyl chloride as follows.  A 2-inch nozzle on the ethyl chloride tank breaks off, allowing release of the contents into the tank dike.  The ethyl chloride will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.   The distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint for the alternative-case release of ethyl chloride using the EPA lookup table is less than 0.06 miles.\n\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances at Grant Chemical to determine the distance to an endpoint for each.   Based on the EPA lookup ta"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams.  In addition, Grant Chemical has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information:    Grant Chemical keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nGrant Chemical primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Grant Chemical periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  \n\nOperating Procedures:     Grant Chemical maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them a"

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.   In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\nContractors:    Grant Chemical uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Grant Chemical evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):    Grant Chemical conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one add"

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:    Grant Chemical has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.   Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).   Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Grant Chemical incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nHot Work Permits and Other Safe Work Practices:    Grant Chemical has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
