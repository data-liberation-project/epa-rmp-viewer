CMWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees, the communities where its facilities are located, and customers.  CMWD staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCMWD has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include:\n\n - A detailed Emergency Response Action Guide\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for the CMWD Emergency Response Team\n - Incident Command System (ICS) w/Unified Command interface\n - ICS position descriptions w/responsibilities\n - Vicinity and evacuation maps\n - Detailed task-by-task plans for:\n     - Evacuation\n     - Fire in a Process or Non-Process Area\n     - Injuries\n     - Threats/Civil Disorder\n     - Wild land or Adjacent Property Fire\n     - External Events (e.g., seismic)\n     - Potential Imminent Danger to Personnel\n     - Chemical Spill \n     - Chlorine Release\n     - Off-Site Event Involving a Hazardous Material\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emerg"

This Plan has been reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Plan (RMP), and CalARP regulations.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nChlorine is used at CMWD Marion Walker Filtration Plant for disinfecting the wastewater treated by the plant.  The main elements of the chlorination system are located in a dedicated building.  The system employs many safety features.  Almost the entire system is operated under vacuum.  In case of a break, the vacuum regulator closes automatically minimizing the quantity of chlorine gas that may escape from the system.  Also, the entire system is connected to the gaseous side of the storage container.  This is also an important safety feature.  The system is also equipped with shutoff mechanisms that close the main valves in case of an emergency.  \n\nChlorine detectors are installed at key locations.  The detectors alarm locally and remotely (i.e., notify the duty operator of the plant.)  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCMWD has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nIn addition to PSM, common indus"

Also, common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute are implemented in system design and day-to-day system operation.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (June 2004 to June 2009) for the Marion Walker Filtration Plant reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCMWD is taking additional steps to further public safety.  In preparation for this submittal, CMWD conducted a revalidation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Seismic Review of the System and associated structures."
