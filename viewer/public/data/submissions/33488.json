The manufacturing operation, based in Wilbraham, MA, includes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration plant, which serves both processing and cold storage warehousing operations.\n\nFriendly's Wilbraham facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals(29CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (40CFR Part 68) because the ammonia inventory of the ammonia plant exceeds the threshold quantity required for inclusion in these programs. Friendly's is committed to preventing a release of anhydrous ammonia that could result in injury or harm to the employees, the public, or the environment. Although the company's safety performance with anhydrous ammonia has been excellent, it is committed to further improving the facility and applicable programs addressing safe storage, use and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Friendly's has implemented several precautionary measures that include process/equipment controls, procedures, preventive maintenance programs, employee training, and audit programs. In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system itself is designed and constructed in accordance with nationally recognized design standards. Friendly's has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases. Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief "

Friendly's has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.\n\nThese safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at least annually by means of SOP review session(s). Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed periodically as well. Friendly's also encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant.\n\nPursuant to written management of change procedures established by Friendly's, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees. Friendly's also understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases, and as a result, has implemented a preventative maintenance program using a CMMS system.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, Friendly's conducts detailed compliance audits every three years. Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, there have been no accidental off-site releases of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nFriendly's has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees, the environment and the community in the event of a release. This program describes the procedures to be followed in order to facilitate response efforts in the eve"
