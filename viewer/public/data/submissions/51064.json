Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\nFor The NGL extraction process, Whiting has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters e.g. temperature, pressure, level, and flow.  Whiting ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe Putman Oswego JT Skid has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Putman Oswego JT Skid maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal shutdown, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown. Whiting has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operation of the JT Skid. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Putman Oswego JT Skid has an excellent record of accident prevention. There have been no releases from the RMP Covered processes in the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Putman Oswego JT Skid does not have a specific written Emergency Action Plan; however employees receive annual training that includes hazardous materials, the incident command system, and fire fighting, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The annual training covers the following topics: Toxicology, Hydrogen Suffide, Chemical Hazard Communication, Lockout/Tagout, Decontamination, Personal Protec"

      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nWhiting Oil & Gas Corporation operates the Putman Oswego JT Skid.  The JT Skid, located in the Oswego gas field, is approximately 5.5 miles southeast of Putman and approximately 9 miles northwest of Thomas.  Whiting has 6 employees assigned to the Oswego JT Skid.\n\nThe primary activities of the JT Skid involving RMP regulated substances are recovering natural gas liquids (NGL) by chilling a gas stream containing liquefiable hydrocarbons. A distillation process is used to purify the hydrocarbons that condense as a result of chilling the gas stream. The NGL product contains: butane, ethane, methane, pentane,  and propane.\n\nThe chilling effect required to recover NGL is provided by using the cold liquid mixture of the incoming gas that is run through separators, expansion valves and a heat exchanger.  The NGL extraction process is Program Level 1.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Whiting Oil & Gas Corporation to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environment. Whiting's Corporate Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident; developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks; communicating relevant information to employees, contractors and appropriate agencies; and conducting emergency exercises. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nWhiting encourages employees to participate in all facets of hazard assessment, hazard elimination, and safe work practices.   An example of employee participation is manditory attendance of all safety meetings and training sessons.  Employees have access to all accident prevention programs via Whiting's Intranet website.. \n\nThe Putman Oswego JT Skid keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the processes. These documents address chemical properties"
