Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to maintain perishable and frozen product.\n\nThe refrigeration system at the Grand Rapids facility is a two-stage, closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side pressure of 0 psig to a high side pressure of 165 psig. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one time has been calculated at 15, 000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSysco Food Service of Grand Rapids has established a trained, in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of anhydrous ammonia. Training for emergency responders is based on the guidelines set forth by OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER). The facility has also established annual refresher training for all personnel on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant-wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with the Kent County LEPC to establish a joint response program. These plans and procedures are periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nSysco Food Service of Grand Rapids has developed a written Emergency Response Plan and trained the refrigeration operators and selected plant personnel in emergency response to hazardous chemical releases. The trained personnel are expected to assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt to initiating a system shutdown. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system including procedures for the emergency shutdown and isolation of equipment should a release occur. This facility has also purchased"
