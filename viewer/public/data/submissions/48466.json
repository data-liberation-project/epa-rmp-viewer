We store frozen, perishable cooler, and dry products for many western New York companies, as well as out of state and Canadian companies.  We handle many customer endpoint shipments for our storage clients.  We store the majority of the product in pallet racking, utilizing all available space to its fullest.  Our facility consists of 117,000 square feet of freezer space, 30,470 square feet of cooler space, and 69,530 square feet of dry storage, office and dock space.\n\nThe refrigeration system or ?process? that we use for our freezers and coolers is a single stage ammonia system containing approximately 14,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is used in a compression and evaporation cycle.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is considered to be a toxic chemical and has several health hazards associated with it.  Ammonia, when in a liquid form, can cause severe burns if contact is made with the skin or eyes.  Ammonia vapors will cause irritation to the eyes and lungs with significant injuries occurring with overexposure to the same.  Other skin and respiratory diseases will be aggravated by exposure to ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas, when in that state, and has a very pungent odor.  When released, in a liquid state, ammonia will evaporate much quicker than water.\n\nOur refrigeration process utilizes 4 Frick screw compressors to maintain temperature.  Each unit can be used individually while the other compressors may be used as 100% backup.  Compressor discharge pressure and system condensing pressure is maintained through the use of two (2) Imeco roof top condensers.  The entire system is monitored by Upstate Electrical Technologies, Inc. with critical point sensors tied into our ADT Security System.\n\nThe Upstate Electrical Technologies Refrigeration Monitoring and Control System is state-of-the art and was u"

The shut down triggers an alarm through our ADT System and all members of the Allied management team are dispatched to the facility.\n\nAllied Frozen Storage has made significant progress in maintaining and monitoring its ammonia refrigeration system.  We have upgraded the onsite computer monitoring system and retained the corporate engineer with 35 years experience in the field of ammonia refrigeration process.  The corporate engineer is based at our Cheektowaga, NY facility.  The engineer is responsible for daily inspections and maintenance, control and monitoring, and all repairs.  He also plays a key role in the proper training of our emergency response team members.  The Corporate Engineer has been connected to the onsite computer monitoring system at his residence.  He has the ability to monitor the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  This permits Allied to be proactive in the safe operation and monitoring of our ammonia refrigeration "

      "SummaryText": "system.\n\nAllied Frozen Storage, Inc. has utilized two (2) specific release scenarios in our RMP report.  Both the ?worst case? and ?alternative case? release scenarios were considered to occur during the hours in which this facility would be unmanned.  These hours are currently from Saturday, 1:00 am ? 7:00 am and again from Saturday, 2:00 pm until we resume regular operations on Sunday, 10:00 pm.  All major holidays are considered unmanned hours at this facility, also.\n\nOur ?worst case? release scenario uses the largest of our process vessels as a model.  Our process includes a controlled pressure receiver that could, at times, contain about half of our operating anhydrous ammonia.  This receiver, in the unlikelihood of a rupture, could release its approximate total contents of 7800 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia into our engine room and subsequently into the atmosphere.  Ammonia, when stored as a liquid under pressure, is totally released within a ten (10) minute period.  We considered our building as mitigation, since the receiver is contained within the facility, to slow the release into the atmosphere.  This scenario could have an offsite impact of over a one (1) mile radius.  Wind direction, wind speed, ambient temperature/humidity all play a part in how much of an impact it would have in our community.  Again, keeping in mind that our facility could be manned during such a release, we have to consider the ability of our actions in response and containment of any such incident.\n\nAllied Frozen Storage, Inc. has considered an alternative release that could be more likely to occur, but still unlikely due to our current daily inspection procedures.  Our process includes two (2) evaporative condensers used to cool the ammonia gas after it has cycled through the system.  These condensers are mounted on the roof of our facility.  We modeled a possible break in an evaporative condenser coil containing ammonia gas.  An accidental release in this scenario would be immediate "

      "SummaryText": "into the atmosphere.  The offsite consequence has a radius of approximately .10 miles.  This endpoint distance is of course affected by atmosphere conditions and may be slightly greater or reduced.  Our ability to respond and shutdown this part of the process is greater because of the estimated release rate of 2.4 pounds per minute.  The distance to en endpoint was not increased, however, in the event of a prolonged, undetected release.  We have facility appointed emergency responders within 5 minutes of our facility, also increased the likelihood of reducing offsite consequences.\n\nAllied Frozen Storage is actively participating in safety meetings and training to maintain, as well as being proactive in the changing regulations facing these times.  We have learned from the mistakes of others.  We know that being involved and concerned with both our employees and the community is of the utmost priority.  The management team, as well as union employees, participates in hands-on training.\n\nWe have our own Emergency Response Program and plan to respond to accidental releases of toxic chemicals in our facility.  The response team consists of 10 people who have all successfully completed a 24 hour hazardous materials technician program.  We coordinate our program with Forks Fire Co., and drill twice yearly.  Our emergency response plan is onsite and reviewed regularly.  Allied?s program consists of step-by-step procedures in notifying the proper authorities and coordination of emergency response procedures with local responders.  Most members of or management team are involved in aspects of this plan.  We refresh our technical training once yearly with an eight (8) hour refresher course.  We utilize standardized forms and notes for documenting aspects of an emergency response situation.  Our program meets our operational needs and currently has not been called into action.
