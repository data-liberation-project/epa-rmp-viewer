The Facility Policy   The owner and employees of Delta Supply, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  I f an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity is the blending and storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application by farmers.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 75,000 pounds in our 10,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tractor-trailer with a capacity of 30,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst Case Scenario\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 75,000 pounds (85% of tank's capacity).\nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nDelta Supply, Inc. has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. The five year accident history\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.\nNor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.

A written emergency response program, in accordance OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\nWe have training with employees several times annually.  Twice a year meetings are held with the fire department to bring to attention and review any changes made to the already existing systems and procedures.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. There have been recent updates to all the plumbing and valves on our storage tank.  We have added extra lighting and better locking capabilities in hopes of deterring any any stealing of anhydrous ammonia which has become a major problem over the last five years among dealers and storage facilities in the last 5 years.  Aside from any assessed maintenance there are no recommendations at this time."
