              "Description": "The primary activity at this facility is the distribution of fertilizer products for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. \n\nOur facility has one regulated substance at our location ? anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  \n\n\n\n1st process: Storage.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontal pressurized tank.  Trained employees, working with the bulk storage of anhydrous ammonia, make routine inspections prior to and during the transfer of anhydrous ammonia to and from bulk storage.  This routine inspection identifies any potential concerns that could arise within the system.  If needed, repairs are made before they become problematic. \n\n\n\nAll employees are trained upon initial hiring to recognize the hazards associated with storage,  handling, and use of anhydrous ammonia, and annually thereafter.  \n\n\n\n2nd process: Our facility produces aqueous phosphatic fertilizer product.\n\nThis process reacts anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid (68%, CAS No. 7664-38-2).  The process uses TVA Pipe Reactor (T-Reactor) technology to neutralize the phosphoric acid with ammonia.  The subsequent liquid product is an ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer, N-P-K, labeled as 10-34-0 fertilizer.  This product is only used for crop production.\n\n\n\nThe raw materials for this process are Superphosphoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia, and water.\n\n\n\nWater is supplied by the facility usually from on-site wells, municipal water plants through a distribution system used to supply water, or from some other safe supply.  To prevent potential contamination of the water supply, an air gap is maintained in the water source tank or a certified backflow preventer is used when the process is hooked directly to the water supply.\n\n\n\nThe production of 10-34-0 is basically a five-step process:\n\n     1.    Ammonia and Superphosphoric Acid are metered/controlled into the T-reactor in the correct proportions to achieve a finished product of neutralized ammonium polyphosphate solution at a pH of about 6.0.\n\n     2.    These materials react and generate heat in the T-reactor and the heat dehydrates or polymerizes the Phosphate present and produces a melt.\n\n     3.    The resulting hot melt from the T-reactor is dissolved in a pool of cool recycled product. All process water and the balance of Ammonia required to achieve the desired product grade are added directly to \n\n        this cooling recirculation sump area.  \n\n     4.    The heat of reaction from the process is removed by passing the finished fluid product over a screening system where air is moving in the opposite direction resulting in partial cooling of the product.  \n\n        Final cooling is accomplished with a water spray system that flows counter to the air movement over screening and palls, leaving only steam exiting from the T-reactor. \n\n     5.    The on-grade product is then passed to storage through a shell and tube heat exchanger where the refrigeration capacity of the process Ammonia (liquid) is used for final cooling to 100? F or less before \n\n        going into storage.\n\nThis process is continuous.  The system operates on a buddy basis where 2 qualified operators are on hand at the site, and both have the qualifications and training to run the process.\n\n\n\n3rd Process: Our facility produces aqueous fertilizer mix with liquid fertilizer blender (Mixer).\n\nThis process produces a liquid fertilizer composed of the three basic plant nutrients, Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (reported as P205); Potassium (reported as K20).  The N is supplied to the process in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, the P205 is supplied as ammonium polyphosphate in the form of 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer, and the K20 is supplied in the form of 60% to 62 % soluble potash.  Process water is also required to dilute the plant nutrients to stable standard grades of commercial fertilizer for crop production.\n\n\n\nOur operators are qualified and trained to operate, manage and preform the process that  mechanically blends-reacts anhydrous ammonia, water, 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer, soluble 60% to 62% potash, clay in various amounts (formulas) to produce the desired NPK crop fertilizers. This process occurs in a mixing tank.\n\n\n\nWe have operated T-reactors and mechanical mixing tanks within our company since 1975 and never had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nThe company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. \n\n",

Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Twin State, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to  \n\n     work with the local fire department, Cedar County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people \n\n     and the environment.\n\n    \n\n2.   Facility Information.\n\n\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of fertilizer products.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers as a \n\n     nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\n     Consistent with the compliance guidelines of 29 CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68, this facility has developed a management system to minimize consequences associated with manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based \n\n     fertilizers.\n\n\n\n     Twin State, Inc. has its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and developed emergency plans.  This program provides plans and information that will assist emergency responders in the event of an accident at \n\n     this facility.\n\n\n\n     Finally, the management system provides procedures and plans to assist employees in conducting both routine and non-routine plant operations, to identify potential hazardous situations, and to respond to \n\n     actual emergencies.\n\n\n\n3.   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations \n\n     covering anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\n     The facility personnel are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

The following two paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\n\n\n     The worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  In this scenario, ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The gaseous ammonia is released at Class F \n\n     stability with 1.5 m/s wind-speed.  \n\n\n\n     The alternative-case scenario involves the release of ammonia over a 2-minute period.  Ammonia is assumed to be released in gaseous form.  The release is assumed to be controlled by excess flow valves, \n\n     emergency shutdown and/or emergency response procedures.
