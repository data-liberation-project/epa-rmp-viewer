Ammonia is used only for the purpose of scrubbing vapors. Everything in this prevention plan applies to all areas except:  The process hazard analysis on the ammonia storage was performed 11/19/98 and the formaldehyde PHA was 12/17/98.  Exceptions in the Process Controls include:  Those listed are for the formaldehyde process. Process controls in the ammonia process include relief valves on the storage tank in addition to the scrubbing of vapors from the process.  The rupture disc listed is on the only pressure vessel, reactor 8. For the \"Mitigation Systems in Use\", only the formaldehyde process is enclosed within the building.",

Our commitment for protecting our employees and the community that is home to our operations is an integral part of our way of doing business.  We have recently formed a CAP (Citizen's Advisory Panel) as a means for assurring issues faced by our facility which may have community impact our reviewed with representatives from the community.\n\n(b)  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLES\n\nAC Molding Compounds  makes melamine-formaldehyde resins and urea-formaldehyde resins that are used as raw materials to make wall plates, buttons and dinnerware. The RMP substances involved with this operation are  50% formaldehyde solution and anhydrous ammonia. \n\n(c)  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 50,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The effects of the release from the evaporating anhydrous ammonia could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the failure of a joint in exterior ammonia piping and the release of 1,000 pounds of material. The effects of the release from the evaporating anhydrous ammonia could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for 50% formaldehyde solution is the failure of an unloading hose and the release of 1,950 pounds of material. The mitigating effects of a dike, berm, drain and sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The effects of the release from the evaporating formaldehyde could reach of"
