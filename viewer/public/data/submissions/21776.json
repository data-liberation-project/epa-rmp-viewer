The RMP substances involved with this operation are  50% formaldehyde solution and anhydrous ammonia. \n\n(c)  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 50,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The effects of the release from the evaporating anhydrous ammonia could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the failure of a joint in exterior ammonia piping and the release of 1,000 pounds of material. The effects of the release from the evaporating anhydrous ammonia could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for 50% formaldehyde solution is the failure of an unloading hose and the release of 1,950 pounds of material. The mitigating effects of a dike, berm, drain and sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The effects of the release from the evaporating formaldehyde could reach of"
