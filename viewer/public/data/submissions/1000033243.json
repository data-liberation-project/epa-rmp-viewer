If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Buckingham County Fire Department as well as the Buckingham County Emergency Services, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Buckingham County Rescue and Southside Community Hospital. This facility has an Emergency Action Plan; however, does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Buckingham Branch Railroad - Buckingham Yard is a butane transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transloading system only, including the associated piping and fourteen (14) storage tanks (detached railcars) and additional railcar storage (up to thirty-one [31]) railcars off-site (solite) on a contiguous line. \r\n\r\nThe Buckingham Branch Railroad - Buckingham Yard complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. This butane transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Texon, L.P.) instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\r\n\r\nThis is a new facility; therefore, it has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property"
