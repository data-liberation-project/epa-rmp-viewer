The branch located in Decatur was one of the first outlying branches.  G.S. Robins has specialized in serving the unique chemical needs of the Midwest.  The Decatur branch is involved with chemical storage and transportation.  Employees at the branch location work with the chemical containers, but do not open any of the containers.\n\nG.S. Robins and Company is a long time member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  Through the NACD G.S. Robins has committed and pledged to constantly improve the management and handling of chemicals by following the \"Responsible Distribution Process(RDP)\".  RDP is a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety, and environmental performance of all member companies.  G.S. Robin's implementation of the RDP includes a commitment to comply with relevant environmental health and safety regulations.  The senior management at G.S. Robins has formally accepted these guiding principles.\n\nRDP includes guiding principles for all aspects of environmental health and safety.  These include:  communication with emergency response officials, operating our facilities in a safe manner, respond to community concerns about chemicals, and to make health, safety and the environment a priority.  In order to verify that G.S. Robins has complied with the guidling principles of RDP, the NACD conducts a third party verification.  The on-site verification is conducted by a third party.  The third party audits G.S. Robins every three years.\n\nThe primary activities at the Decatur branch consist of the following:  drum and tote storage, material loading and unloading, and transporation.  The Decatur facility of G.S. Robins has three of the 140 chemicals identified by the EPA above the threshold quantity.  These chemicals are:  sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and chlorine.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The worst-case scenario for the Decatur facility of G.S. Robins involves chlorine.  Chlorine is stored on-site in three different types of containers.  These containers are:  2,000 lb. cylinder, 1490 lb. cylinder and 150 lb. cylinder.  The worst-case scenario demonstrates all of the chlorine on-site being released at one time.  The maximum amount on-site is 67,340 lbs.  The scenario would be either a fire or explosion causing a complete release of all material at one time.  The scenario has an offsite impact radius of 17 miles(estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint).  The modeling was done using the EPA COMP program.  The likelihood of this scenario taking place is remote.  The chlorine is stored in the facilities outside storage area.  G.S. Robins does not have the maximum amount of inventory on-site at all times.  Currently, G.S. Robins and Company is investigating methods to reduce the amount of inventory on hand.\n\nThe alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins-Decatur consist of problems that are more likely to happen.  As a chemical distributor, we move a large quantity of chemicals.  During the moving ro storage of a chemical, there is always the chance that a container could begin leaking.  The leaking could be caused by several factors.  There factors include:  overfilling, jostling during transporation, or just a leak.  G.S. Robins employees are all trained on safe material handling and how to properly handle spills and leaks.  All chemicals reported are stored in the outdoor chemical storage area.  The following are the alternative scenarios at G.S. Robins-Decatur.  These alternative scenarios were completed on the EPA COMP modeling program.\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR OUTDOOR CHEMICAL STORAGE\nThe outdoor chemical storage consists different cylinders.   The cylinders are stored on site to ship to G.S. Robins outlying branches or directly to customers.  The Alternative Scenarios represent incidents that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  G.S. Ro"

Robins and Company Emergency Action Plan consists of guidance for evacuation, fires, spills, tornadoes and bombthreats.  In addition, the plan contains information on emergency contacts, plant layouts, and emergency reporting requirements.\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nG.S. Robins and Company has learned important information about safety and the environment.  This information has come from participation in the RDP program and completing the RMP requirements.  Improvements are an on-going process.  The completion of the RMP program has lead to several processes that are being evaluated.  Process hazard analysis are being reviewed and updated.  Our emergency action plan is being reviewed and updated for all facilities.  G.S. Robins is evaluating the inventories of chemicals stored and alternatives."
