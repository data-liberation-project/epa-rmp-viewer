Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nThe Kansas City Foam plant, as part of the WoodBridge Group of companies, believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, should be of the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n     -  Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\n\n     -  Review and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety and environmental   \n\n        improvements\n\n\n\nOur complete Health Safety and Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility.\n\n\n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in the document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Our plant manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our plant manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to the process manager who has the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program.  The RMP coordinator, acting with the authority delegated by the plant manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nB.)

Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, crushed, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by rail car and tanker truck.  It is stored in two bulk tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank farm.  The TDI is then transferred to the process by an automated system.  Access to the tank farm is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.  All personnel must use the buddy system when entering the tank farm area.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at the facility is approximately 430,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nC.)  Off-site conssequence analysis scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint was Aloha version 5.4.4 software for plume modeling.  Atmospheric conditions were obtained from the NCDC for the Kansas City Internatiional airport located approximately 15 miles north west of our facility.  Parameters used for the model were 100 degrees Fahrenheit air temperature, 54% relative humidity, 1.5 m/s winds from the north east, and class B stability.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nCatastrophic failure of a rail car full of TDI at the rail siding, discharging its entire contents of 187,500 pounds in 10 minutes, as is stipulated in the RMP rule.

Our program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We have coordinated our program with the Mid America Regional Council LEPC and the Riverside Fire Department.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n\n\nG.)
