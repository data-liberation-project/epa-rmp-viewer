NGL, which is primarily propane, is stored in two 30,000 gallon bulk storage tanks and the remaining gas is currently being flared.\n\nThe stripping process is accomplished by increasing the pressure and lowering the temperature of the incoming natural gas.\n\nThe average quantity of propane stored is 24,000 gallons.  However, in inclement weather, the stroage could increase to 48,000 gallons.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release wold be a vapor cloud explosion.  The EPA's OCA guidance used to determine the endpoint for this scenario.  The scenario is based on storage of 48,000 gallons (240,000 lbs) of NGL (primarily propane).  The distance to an over pressure is of 1.0 psi will be 0.50 miles.  The total residential population within this area is estimated to be 57.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the worst case scenario will ever happen.  The product stored (propane) is at or below atmospheric temperature and at or below 100 psig pressure.  The storage tanks are rated at 250 psig and each tank has three 2 inch relief valves to relive excess pressure.  These valves are set at the rated pressure of the storage tanks.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario\n\nThe alternate case scenario considers a vapor cloud explosion from one tank upset.  The scenario assumes the one tank is fil"

The total residental population within this are is estimated to be 4.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that this altenrate case will ever happen for the same reasons given in the worst case scenario discussion.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Salme Gas Processing Plant is covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and has developed the required PSM Plan.\n\nAll employees have less than one year of experience operating a gas processing plant. These employeess were involved in the construction of the present plant.\n\nThere are shut down systems for each step in the process to protect employees and equipment.\n\nAll critical equipment is visually inspected daily and ultrasonic testing is done every five years on vessels and piping.  Relief valves are inspected annually.  The combustible gas and hydrogen sulfide detection systems are checked monthly.\n\nChemical safety training is presented annually to all plant personnel.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no offiste releases since the plant was started up in July of 2006.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nCitaiton Oil & Gas corp. personnel met with the Salem Fire Department and discussed the Emergency Response Plan for the gas plant.\n\nThe Salem Fire Department will be the primary responder to any release.\n\nCitation Oil & Gas Corp. personnel have been trained in response procedures and the limitations of company manpower.  Personnel have also been trained in chemical safety, including Hazard Communication, Personal Protective Equipment, Portable Fire Extinguishers, Emergency Fir Aid and CPR.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nReduction in inventory will reduce the danger to employees and the public.  Methods are no being studied to lower the inventory of propane in storage."
