Subsidiary concerns are minimization  of damage to the environment or Knouse Foods equipment, property and product as well as compliance with the regulations.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System Cold Storage No. 1\n\nKnouse Foods, Orrtanna Plant is a process and storage facility for apples.  The facility is equipped with an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system serving coolers, freezers, and production water chillers.  The total system capacity of refrigerant is 18,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was calculated to be the failure of the largest single ammonia storage vessel in the refrigeration system.  The vessel holds 5,800 pounds of ammonia during normal operating charge.  In addition, it was assumed that an additional 580 pounds of ammonia contained in the pipeline to the storage vessel would also be released for a total worst-case scenario of 6,380 pounds of ammonia.  The off-site consequences analysis for the worst-case release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp v.1.06. The release duration was 10 minutes with a release rate 351 pounds per minute (lbs/min).  Mitigation measures considered included release into the building.  The results of the modeling indicated that the toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of ammonia would be reached at a distance of 1.1 miles from the release point.\n  \nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed that a leak develops in the piping system of the refrigeration system.  Based on the curre"

The off-site consequences analysis for the alternate release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp v.1.06. The release duration was 1 minute with a release rate of 150 lbs/min.  Mitigation measures considered included release into the building.  The results of the modeling indicated that the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia would be reached at less than 0.1 mile from the release point.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nKnouse Foods has developed and implemented a PSMP in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Standard 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, for operation of the ammonia refrigeration system at Knouse Foods, Orrtanna Plant.  The PSMP has been revised to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations, 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe PSMP and RMP for the Knouse Foods, Orrtanna Plant includes detailed sections on the following:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractor Safety\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Planning and Response\nCompliance Audits\nOff-site Consequences Analysis.\n\nIn addition to the PSMP and RMP, Knouse Foods maintains the following documents as part of the safety program at Knouse Foods, Orrtanna Plant:\n\nOn-site Emergency Response Plan, Orrtanna, Pa.
