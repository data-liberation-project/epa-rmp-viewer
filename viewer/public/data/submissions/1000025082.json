The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\r\n\r\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field\r\npersonnel are trained on ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective\r\nequipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure\r\npersonnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Cheney Brothers,\r\nInc. (Riviera Beach Facility) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and\r\nequipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a\r\ndemonstration of Cheney Brothers, Inc. Riviera Beach Facility's high degree of commitment to public safety and\r\nservice, Cheney Brothers, Inc.

The five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable releases in the past five (5) years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential\r\nfuture release of anhydrous ammonia, Cheney Brothers, Inc. (Riviera Beach Facility) is implementing a detailed\r\nProcess Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. Cheney Brothers, Inc. (Riviera Beach Facility) has a detailed\r\nEmergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly\r\ndetermining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an\r\naccidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Cheney Brothers, Inc. (Riviera Beach Facility) conducts scheduled drills of\r\nthe emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be\r\ntaken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies\r\nresponsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nCheney Brothers, Inc. (Riviera Beach Facility) is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from\r\nthe most recent Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the\r\nprogram allows Cheney Brothers, Inc. (Riviera Beach Facility) to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any\r\npotential exposure of Cheney Brothers, Inc.

Specific actions taken to improve safety are the\r\nimplementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training,\r\nadministrative controls, and computerized system controls."
