      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\r\n\r\nLineage - Hunter Park Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nLineage - Hunter Park Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nLineage - Hunter Park Facility is located at 1001 Columbia Avenue. Riverside, California 92507, which is approximately 1 mile east of Interstate 215 and 1.5 miles north of California Freeway 60.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is a mixture of mostly urban and some rural areas. The facility was constructed and began operating in 2011. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFICATIONS STEPS\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP/RMP/PSM Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage - Hunter Park Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at the Facility is over the 500 lbs. state threshold for CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to CalARP Program Level 3.  The regulated substance is also over the 10,000 lbs. federal threshold for EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and Cal-OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  As a result, the ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to RMP Program Level 3 and PSM.\r\n\r\nA CalARP/RMP"

      "SummaryText": "/PSM Program is in place and it can be found with the General Manager and the Maintenance Refrigeration Lead Operator. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nLineage - Hunter Park Facility has had no releases in the last five years (March 2011 - January 2016) that meets the five-year accident history reporting criteria, therefore no data is required. \r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nIn addition, Lineage - Hunter Park Facility has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place to properly prepare for emergency evacuations, to provide first aid and medical treatment and to contact federal, state and local officials in the event of a major release of ammonia. The Facility Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local responding units, such as the City of Riverside Fire Department or HAZMAT Team.  A current copy of the EAP and Crisis Management Plan, that includes ammonia responses, can be found with the General and Maintenance Managers.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Facility has submitted a Hazardous Material Inventory (HMI) Business Plan via California Environmental Reporting System (CERS). \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include:\r\n\u00bfA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation was performed in November, 2015. \r\n\u00bfA Hazard Assessment, performed in December 2015.\r\n\u00bfA Seismic Assessment was performed on December, 2015.\r\n\u00bfA Compliance Audit was performed on December, 2015\r\n\r\nAny outstanding recommendations from these studies and the target completion date or closure have been provided within each individual report.  Refer to 2015 - Five Year Update Submittal Package for detail information."
