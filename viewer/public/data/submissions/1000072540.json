The PSM/RMP will be updated as the Burkburnett Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes.  The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Wichita County LEPC and local Fire Department.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, and 6 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Burkburnett Facility."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Agri-Enterprises, LLC pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at the Burkburnett Facility, Burkburnett, TX.  The Facility engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use Helena products to support agricultural operations.  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Burkburnett Facility located approximately 2 miles northwest of Burkburnett, TX at 2202 South Red River Expressway, Burkburnett, TX 76354.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Burkburnett Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Burkburnett Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is updating the EPA RMP to reflect changes to the process (i.e. removal of stationary pressure vessels; removal of the Nurse Tank Load Out; revisions to the plumbing; change in company name; and changes to the Emergency Contact). All applicable sections of the PSM/RMP have been addressed.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Operations at the Burkburnett Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Burkburnett Facility stores and handles one covered chemical (anhydrous ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA.  Two (2) covered processes are operated at this"

      "SummaryText": "Facility and they include:\r\n\r\no\tCovered Process 1: Storage & Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia)\r\no\tCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\r\n\r\nThe Burkburnett Facility receives anhydrous ammonia by commercial tanker truck.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to one of two (2) stationary pressure vessels.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.\r\n\r\nAt this Facility, anhydrous ammonia is loaded out into the stationary pressure vessesls for storage.  The Facility loads out to a mobile pipe reactor (MPR) for the blending of ammonium polyphosphate. When blending ammonium polyphosphate, the anhydrous ammonia is blended with water and phosphoric acid.  Ammonium polyphosphate is a liquid fertilizer that is used by farmers on a seasonal basis.  Covered process equipment used in this process includes a stationary pressure vessel for the storage of the anhydrous ammonia and a MPR.  The stationary pressure vessels are owned by the Facility, and the MPR is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  When the IFRC arrives to the Facility, the Facility transfers the responsibility of the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary pressure vessels to the IFRC.  At this point, the IFRC connects the MPR to the stationary pressure vessels with transfer hoses and safety valves.  When the IFRC is complete with its operations, the IFRC transfers the responsibility for the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary pressure vessels back to the Facility.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage process and the fertilizer blending process.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the ammonia storage and the blending process because the largest vessel (i.e. a 48,000-gallon stationary storage tank) is common to both of the covered processes when connected.  The worst case scenario release for t"

      "SummaryText": "he Burkburnett Facility was modeled as if the 48,000-gallon stationary storage tank was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are the same for the two processes.  For the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation.  For the fertilizer blending process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the blending process.  Mitigation equipment involved in this alternative scenario includes excess flow valves and emergency shutoff valves, and operating procedures that the Facility and the IFRC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Warehouse Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Warehouse Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Operators are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.  \r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Manager is responsible for managing the IFRC in accordance with the Contractor PSM/RMP requirements.  However, the IFRC is responsible for ensuring that its Operators are properly trained in the implementation of its OSHA PSM accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is"
