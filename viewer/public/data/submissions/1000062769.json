CSS is owned and operated by Duke Energy.  The RMP Resubmission includes administrative changes and PHA for a new process that will be supplying anhydrous ammonia to a new electric generating unit.   The new anhydrous ammonia process is similiar to the existing process on Unit 5.  They two systems will be operated independently.   \n\n\n\nPLANT AND PROCESS INFORMATION\n\n\n\nCSS uses anhydrous ammonia system as a component supporting selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of the plant's boiler emissions.  Ammonia vapor (in the presence of the SCR catalyst) reduces NOx compounds to elemental nitrogen and water to reduce the total NOx effluent emitted from the plant.  The first system was installed on Unit #5 in 2002. In 2012, a new coal burning electric generating plant (Unit 6) will go in production and use anhydrous ammonia to control NOx.  The new anhydrous ammonia system for Unit 6 is similiar to Unit 5.   The two systems will be operated independently. The anhydrous ammonia system is comprised of four storage tanks, two with a capacity of 45,000 gallons each, and two with capacity of 60,000 gallons each, along with feed pumps and vaporizing equipment.  The total quantity of ammonia exceeds threshold quantities which invoke the requirements of the Risk Management regulations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nCSS is committed to public safety, employee safety, continued reliable operation, and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the developmen"

This multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\n\n\nAmmmonia gas detection and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\n\n\nProcess instrumentation and interlocks which will shutdown the system and isolate ammonia supplies to the plant if process conditions (such as flow, temperature, and pressure) are not within their appropriate safe operating ranges;\n\n\n\nProcess safety information which documents the safe design of the process system;\n\n\n\nProcess hazards analysis to evaluate the chemical and process hazards and make recommendations for safety improvements;\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures to ensure the system is operated safely;\n\n\n\nMaintenance, inspection, and testing of system components to ensure that they are safe for continued use;\n\n\n\nSafe work practices to ensure that employees working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely, and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation procedure to investigate accidents and \"near-misses\" to determine root causes and make needed safety improvements;\n\n\n\nTraining on all aspects of the program, operations, maintenance, chemical hazards, emergency response, and related aspects to ensure employees are continually aware of what is required to operate the system safely; and\n\n\n\nPeriodic compliance audits to ensure that the management system and prevention programs are working as they should.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nCliffside has not had any releases that resulted in injuries or property damages.\n\n\n\nCSS has previously an"

CSS maintains a 24/7 emergency response team on-site with the appropriate number of members, training, and equipment to actively respond to and take action necessary to secure credible releases of ammonia that might occur.  Additionally, there are a number of emergency operations procedures in place which detail the appropriate emergency actions that would help mitigate the effects of releases.\n\n\n\nMAINTAINING A SAFE OPERATION\n\n\n\nDuke Energy and Cliffside Steam Station will continually work to safely manage the hazards of the ammonia system to protect the communities we serve and the employees, vendors and visitors at the station.  The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases through training, procedures, equipment maintenance, and safe work practices.  Periodically, CSS will audit the program, review the Process Hazard Analysis, coordinate wth community emergency response organizations, and will update the program as needed to assure safe and efficient control and management of the anhydrous ammonia system."
