To accomplish this we integrated health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities. This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc., Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective. This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations. This policy refers to the facility's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n \n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility makes melamine formaldehyde resins, methylated melamine resins, resin additives and lubes.

The Site Leader has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nLead Production Technicians are responsible for maintaining and improving the safety of their shifts. Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training Production Technicians so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their Shift. All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program. Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains, their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion.\n\nManagement of Change system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. For equipment, procedure, and processes changes, a MOC initiates a safety review. This review may include a process hazard analysis. Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and the Site Leader.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact. Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change has been made.\n\nA preventative maintena"

Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other hot work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release."
