      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nBrownfield Farmers Coop Station is strongly committed to employee, public, and enviromental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our compehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such releases do occur we will notify the Brownfield Fire Department, which provides emergency response.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in seven, approximately 33-ton tanks at our facility in Browndield.  The maximum amount store is 200.2 tons (400,400 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  THe following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the seven interconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (400,400 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmoshperic stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 8.7 miles.  THe estimated population within a 8.7 mile radius of this facility is 13,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The scenario involves the release of 7,995.83 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile.  The estimated population within a 0.31 mile radius os the facility "

      "SummaryText": "is 40.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydours Ammonia\" of the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  We are also guided by the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administratin (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Hankdong of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nOur record of prevention accidental releases over the last 5 years is excellent.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occured during this period\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  THe plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacustions, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public."
