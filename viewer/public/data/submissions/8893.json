The Prevention Plan contains safety information relating to chlorine and the chlorination system and establishes standard protocols for items such as system operations, maintenance, system changes, contractor safety, and incident investigation.  The Prevention Plan also describes training for employees on the safe operation of the chlorination systems.  In addition, at least once a year, South Bend Water Works chlorine provider sponsors a training seminar on safety and handling of chlorine, which is attended by both South Bend Water Works and South Bend Fire Department employees.  \n\nThe South Bend Water Works has established emergency response procedures, which are documented in the South Bend Water Works Distribution Department Emergency Response Plan.   South Bend Water Works facilities containing chlorine are equipped with ambient chlorine detectors (inside the chlorine ton container rooms), ambient level displays (outside the chlorine ton container rooms), and audible alarms (outside the chlorine ton container rooms).  \n\nThe ton cylinders are equipped with vacuum regulators, through which chlorine gas flows to the injector under vacuum.  Loss of vacuum causes the vacuum-regulating valve to automatically shut off the gas supply at the source.  All potential releases from South Bend Water Works facilities will be responded to by the South Bend Fire Department, whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities and trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n\t'68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Cleveland Road Well Field facility.

These containers are located inside a building.  One container is isolated by a vacuum automatic transfer valve. An additional two 1-ton containers, which may be empty or full, are stored inside the building.  \n\nGaseous chlorine from the 1-ton containers is drawn by a vacuum to a chlorinator located inside the building in a room adjacent to the ton container room.  In the chlorinator, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then injected into the distribution main; the injection point is located in a 12-foot diameter vault outside of the building.

For the Cleveland Road Well Field the worst-case scenario is a release from one of the 1-ton containers (greatest amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine. It is assumes that the container ruptures and its contents escape to the ground in ten minutes.  The worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nUSEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP rule applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under '68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe South Bend Water Works Cleveland Road Well Field utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in '68.150 by June 21, 1999 (three years after publication of the final rule). Since public employees are covered under the state-delegated OSHA program, the Cleveland Road Well Field is subject to the OSHA PSM standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements.  \n\nUSEPA's RMP rule requires that covered facilities prepare an executive summary.  The following pages represent the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described in '68.155 (a) through (g).\n\n\n\t'68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the South Bend Water Works chlorination systems, the South Bend Water Works depends on the commitment and team effort of their employees and suppliers.  This commitment and team effort is supported from the top ma"

The emergency response procedures are outlined in the South Bend Water Works Distribution Department Emergency Response Plan.  South Bend Water Works facilities containing chlorine are equipped with chlorine detectors with audible alarms.  The chlorine processes are equipped with vacuum regulators, which terminate flow if a release occurs.  A SCADA system sends an alarm signal via computer and telephone to the South Bend Water Works office and on-call personnel.\n\n\n\t'68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) in March of 1996 by Triad Engineering.  These recommendations primarily involved ensuring that procedures established in the Prevention Plan are followed.  The South Bend Water Works has committed to installing scrubbers at all of its chlorination facilities within the next five to ten years.  These scrubber devices will be able to mitigate a release from the largest chlorine container stored at the facility."
