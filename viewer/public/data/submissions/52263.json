Starrett Company (Starretts) stores up to 66,528 pounds of propane at the 121 Crescent Street Athol, Massachusetts site in it's 18,000 gallon propane storage tank.  Starretts is required to address the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 because they exceed the 10,000 propane regulatory threshold.\nThere are a number of other vessels throughout the facility that are below the RMP regulatory thresholds including the 1,000 gallon propane generator tank, the 500 gallon propane forklift filling tank and two, 250 pound ammonia storage containers. These chemicals are not required to be reported according to RMP Regulation 40 CFR 68.  A 5,500 gallon methanol storage tank is also located in the facility that is regulated under OSHA PSM Regulation as a flammable liquid.\nThe executive summary provides an overview of facility specific information that was generated during the development of the RMP. The RMP electronic submittal form was submitted and reviewed by EPA on February 15, 2000 and must be re-submitted to the EPA within five years of the initial submission or sooner under the following conditions:\n* No later than three years after a newly regulated substance is first listed by EPA;\n* No later than the date on which a new regulated substances is first present in an already covered process above a threshold quantity;\n* No later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a new process;\n* Within six months of a change that requires a revised PHA;\n* Within six months of a change that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis and defined as a decrease/increase to endpoint by a factor of two; and\n* Within six months of a change that alters the program level that applied to any covered process.\n    Note:    I"

      "SummaryText": "f a facility is no longer subject to the regulation, the owner or operator shall re-submit a revised registration to EPA within six months indicating that the facility is no longer covered.\nBased on our review of available information during our January 28, 2003 audit, there was a program level change since February 2000 that required re-submittal of the electronic RMP.  More specifically, the facility uses propane for heating and for hardening (heat treating) metals.  Since the facility uses propane as a source of carbon in their hardening process, the original RMP was developed to comply with the requirements of the OSHA PSM.  The EPA RMP regulation requires that facilities subject to OSHA PSM regulations be categorized as Program 3 facilities.\nWe inadvertently categorized Starrett's as a Program 2 facility in the initial February 2000 RMP submittal.  We updated and resubmitted the RMP information on May 9, 2003 to indicate that Starrett's is a Program 3 facility.  We also updated administrative changes in the RMP submittal form (e.g. contact names).\nBased on our review of available information since 2003, there were minor changes that would require re-submittal of the electronic RMP. These changes include more accurate latitude and longitude coordination for the tank (i.e. actual location of tank vs. address of facility) and updated population counts for the hazard assessment.\nThe photographs found in the executive summary of the RMP represent conditions at the time of the initial RMP development.  The facility photo-documents changes made at the facility as a result of the PHA recommendations. The photos typically include a written description of the specific PHA corrective action.  \n2.0    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \nThe site specific RMPC has been identified as Joe Sumner.  Please note that the RMPC is a collective term that refers to the overall RMP program managers as well as anyone these individuals may designate to assist them with the implementation of this program.\n"

The local agencies also receive a copy of the emergency response plan (periodically upon updating) and Tier II forms (annually).  Emergency personnel also tour the facility on periodic basis to familiarize themselves with chemical hazards at the Starretts.\nBased on our review of available information, the affected population numbers increased since 2000 because of 1) more conservative population density measurements used in models, 2) new census data, and 3) updated latitude and longitude references. This updated information is incorporated into the 2008 EPA re-submittal.\n4.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION \nImportant health and safety information must be readily available for the chemical and processes for a variety of reasons (e.g., emergencies, equipment maintenance, etc.).  A listing of the information is included in Section 4.4 of the RMP.\n\nA significant amount of this information can be found primarily throughout the RMP document.  However, the facility periodically reviews the list found in Section 4.4 of the RMP, as well as the written compliance programs, and provides additional information when necessary (e.g., equipment manuals, inspection records, etc.).  A separate process safety file is maintained for RMP documentation at the facility, which includes equipment such as ovens, heaters, etc.\n\n5.0 PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS \nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed at the facility and is included in Section 5.5 of the RMP.

A safe work permit is also completed during these maintenance activities. \n9.0    MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE \nThe facility establishes and implements written procedures to manage any change to the facility or to the process chemicals (e.g., introduction of new chemicals).  This procedure is implemented by using the Management of Change forms (MOC) found in Section 9.5 of the RMP.  \nThese forms provide a system that evaluates potential changes to the system and potential effects on the process safety operation.  The forms are completed any time there is a change to the process that could affect the overall safety of the chemical system.  All RMPC designees are familiar with this process.\nThere have been minor changes to the system since the implementation of the RMP and PSM (e.g. replacement of relief valves).  This work on the system is considered \"replacement in kind\", which means identical replacement parts were used.\n10.0    PRE-START SAFETY REVIEW \nThe facility performs pre-startup safety reviews for new or modified facilities.  The checklist found in Section 5 (PHA) of the RMP provides the necessary information to review and evaluate potential modifications to the existing process.  This process is started as soon as possible in the conceptual design of the project.\nIf there are any renovations or facility changes that would impact the process systems, the forms found in Section 10.4 (Action Item Documentation) of the RMP are completed and action items are incorporated into the project.  Appropriate changes are also incorporated into standard operating procedures (e.g. lockout/tagout, emergency plan, operating procedures, etc.).

The facility also reviews these latter programs during training. Comprehensive audits of the regulated processes at the facility have been performed on January 28, 2003 and January 13, 2006 that identified a number of requirements Starretts must follow. Starretts documents compliance in writing with these audit findings upon completion of each task.\n12.0    INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe facility investigates every incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals within 48 hours of the incident. The standard investigation system for evaluating these types of accidents is included in Section 12.4 of the RMP.  This includes an investigation form that must be completed at the time of the accident.\nUpon completion of this activity, a group of individuals investigates and determines why the accident took place.  Recommendations for corrective actions are provided, implemented, and documented.  This minimizes the potential for reoccurrence of future similar accidents.\nOn February 23, 1997, Starrett had a vaporizer fire in their propane system.  Because the exact quantity of release was unknown, an estimation was incorporated into the RMP Submittal.  Based on the vaporizer operation, five pounds of propane was estimated to be released to the atmosphere.  The emergency shut-off valves were closed by the Athol Fire Department to extinguish the flames.  Both vaporizers were replaced after this accident.\nAnother minor incident occurred on July 26, 1999 while the propane tank was being drained for repairs.  An estimated quantity of nine pounds was released from the system.  The incident was investigated and the reports are shown in Section 12.0 (Incident Investigation) of the RMP"
