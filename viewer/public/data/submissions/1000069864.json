      "SummaryText": "At the Saint Francis - NH3 Plant- 12 Miles South facility, Stratton Equity Cooperative stores anhydrous ammonia which is considered a regulated toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it. It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community. Safety depends upon the competent training of our personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled: Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program: This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations. The facility design and construction are in accordance with the ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards. It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all applicable standards by an out-of-house person. Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards. Employees of the fertilizer department at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using industry training\r\nprograms and schools.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history: This s"
