Our goals are to promote and \n   strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and \nprocedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site produces several brands of trade name herbicides.  These include Banvel(R), Clarity(R), Distinct(R), and Frontier(R), as well as a variety of other formulations, which are used in the farm sector to enhance growth, to eliminate weeds, and to improve the yield in general.  Chlorine, dimethylamine, methyl chloride, and methyl chloroformate are used  to produce some of these products.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n* Toxic gas release of chlorine with off-site impacts resulting from rupture of a chlorine railcar.\n\n* Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine from a railcar with off-site impacts.\n\n\nAlternative\n\n* Vessel leak of chlorine with minimal off-site impact.  Active mitigation that is available but not accounted \n   for in determining the off-site impact includes firewater sprays to limit gas evolution as well as a flow-\n   limiting valve.\n\n* Vessel leak of methyl chloride with no off-site impact.  Passive mitigation considered is a dike and active \n   mitigation includes a foam sprinkler system.\n\n* Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine with minimal off-site impact.  Active \n   mitigation consists of diluting anhydrous dimethylamine with water upon receiving it, which drastically\n   reduces its flammability.\n\n*  A pipe leak of methyl chloroformate with minimal off-site impact.  Passive mitigation includes a dike. \n   Active mitigation includes a deluge, sprinkler and neutralization system.\n\n* A pipe leak of phosphorous oxychloride with minimal offsite impact.  Passive mitigation includes a dike.  \n  Ac"

Extensive efforts have been made to avoid situations that could provide the conditions which could lead to the release of any chemical used on site.  These efforts include (1)  HAZOP or Zurich analysis of all new or modified systems, (2)  Pre-startup safety reviews, and (3)  Specific operating procedures for normal conditions as well as emergency situations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission.  The site is a member of the Sabine Area Chiefs Association, which is a mutual aid group, and assists the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission.  The site maintains a complete fire fighting facility manned by volunteer employees who receive extensive training.  This training consists of offsite training as well as regularly scheduled on-site drills.  A plant wide system of fire water piping with emergency pumps and power.  A system of foam generators are available wherever flammable solvents are stored and throughout the tank farm.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc."
