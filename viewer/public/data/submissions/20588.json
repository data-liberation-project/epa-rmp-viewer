      "SummaryText": "The Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Aurora Cooperative emergency response plan involves the response services available in the community.  The Central City, Nebraska Fertilizer Plant is a retail facility for liquid fertilizer used for agriculture and serves the southern Merrick County Area.  Anhudrous Ammonia is used and stored on site for part of the year, typically during the months of March and April.  This anhydous ammonia is stored in up to three (3) individual 1,500 gallon nurse tanks connected to a valve manifold and used in a process of converting dry fertilizer into liquid fertilizer.  This plant is normally manned during business hours.  Offsite consequence Analysis includes the consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and alternative release\" scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the \"owner or operator shall assume that the...Maximum quantity of the largest vessel...is released as a gas over a 10 minute period\", due to an uspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anydrous ammonia released before it's concentration decreases to a \"non-toxic\" level.  For this purpose, Aurora Cooperative has chosen to use RMP-Comp version 1.05 to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (.14mg/l or about 200 ppm) and to determine the population affected by a potential release using maps extracted from Landview 3 software.  The worst case release scenario for the Aurora Cooperative - Central City facility involves the release of the entire 19,125 lbs of product stored on site.  The alternative release scenario is based on failure of a one inch connecting hose with the excess flow valve"
