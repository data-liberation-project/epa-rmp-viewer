However, it is recognized that there may exist a remote possibility that an unforeseen emergency event could occur.  Accordingly, our RMP describes what could theoretically happen in such an event.   This summary is organized as follows:\r\n\r\nIntroduction; \r\nArkema Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety;\r\nFacility Identification and regulated substances in covered processes;\r\nPrevention Program; \r\nFive-Year Accident History; \r\nEmergency Response Plan; and\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\r\n\r\nArkema Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\r\n\r\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at Arkema for many years;  this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  We are committed to conducting our operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \r\n\r\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety starts with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Senior management routinely dedicate time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors. \r\n\r\nArkema Inc.'s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill its commitment to health, environment, and safety.

In issues related to emergency response, Arkema works with the Livingston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to plan responses to emergencies and to assist the Plant Emergency Organization (PEO) in actual response efforts as and if needed.  These emergency plans are reviewed with the LEPC, and other local emergency responders like the fire and police departments, and hospitals.  Our plant's Community Advisory Panel (CAP) was started in early 1998 to inform the community about our plant and related activities and address questions or concerns. \r\n\r\nArkema Inc. also takes pride in our commitment to protect the environment.  We are dedicated to continuous reduction of waste, and have a comprehensive program designed to promote recycling and waste minimization. \r\n\r\nArkema is also part of Responsible Care, an industry-wide initiative among members of the American Chemistry Council.

Many common plastic products such as automobile components, toys, food packaging, etc., are manufactured with the chemicals produced at the Geneseo plant. \r\n\r\nArkema uses one of the substances regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule, above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.
