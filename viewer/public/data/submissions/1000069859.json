In the event an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Lancaster County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information.  \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is NAICS code \"424910 Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers\". Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time. \n\n\n\nThe fertilizer product, anhydrous ammoina is received, stored for direct application to farm fields during early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year product transfer does not occur.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi trailer vehicle tank.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five-years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program.  The facility has a Emergency Action Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response actiion is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.
