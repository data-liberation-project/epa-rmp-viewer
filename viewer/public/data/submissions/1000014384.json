The Raw Water Disinfection Facility disinfects potable water delivered to the City of Abilene, as well as to wholesale customers supplied through neighboring communities and water supply corporations. Chlorine gas and liquid sodium chlorite are used in the disinfection process at the Raw Water Disinfection Facility.  Up to 12,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Raw Water Disinfection Facility. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (A?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Raw Water Disinfection Facility is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (A?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the CityA?s Director of Water Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\n    The Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturersA? recommendations (A?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Raw Water Disinf"

      "SummaryText": "ection Facility has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (A?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (A?68.50 & A?68.58).\n\nThe Raw Water Disinfection Facility complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR A?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Raw Water Disinfection Facility is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The City of AbileneA?s Office of Emergency Management maintains a community-wide Emergency Response Plan which encompasses the Raw Water Disinfection Facility. Per the CityA?s Emergency Response Plan WTP operators are trained to notify the CityA?s Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Raw Water Disinfection Facility.  The City of AbileneA?s Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the CityA?s Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (A?68.90(b)).  This facility is generally unmanned except during chlorine cylinder delivery, cylinder changes, routine maintenance, etc.  \n"
