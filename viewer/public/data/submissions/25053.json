Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFarmers Cooperative Elevator Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that\nactivities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various\nmodes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators\ninvolved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nFarmers Cooperative Elevator Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure\nthat employees who are operating processes are competent in the oper"

Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel\nwith previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive\nmaintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems,\nemergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the\nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company to manage changes in\nprocess chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance\npersonnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions\nare promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nFarmers Cooperative Elevator Company routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nFarmers Cooperative Elevator Company conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\nwhether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nFarmers Cooperative Elevator Company truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company in Westside are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Westside Fire\nDepartment, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 26,000-gallon tank and two interconnected 18,000-gallon tanks at our facility\nin Westside (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored in the fixed tanks is 52,700 gallons (271,194\npounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.  With the added capacity of facility nurse tanks, the\nmaximum total amount capable of being stored at the facility is 510, 000 pounds.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.
