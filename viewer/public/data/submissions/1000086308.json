Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. (EGTS) operates the facility which is owned by Eastern Gathering and Processing, Inc. (EGP).\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nEGTS is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is EGTS's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. EGTS has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil/Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise. Also, EGTS will contact the Wetzel County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nStationary Source, Regulated Substances Handles & Covered Process:\n\nThe Galmish Loading and Storage Facility handles five regulated flammable substances; propane, butane, isobutane, ethyl mercaptan and a flammable mixture. Propane, butane, and isobutane [propane, 2-methy l) are stored in spheres until loaded on tank cars or tank trucks. Propane can also be pumped back to the Hastings Extraction Plant. Ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol) is used to odorize propane so that a leak of this otherwise odorless substance can"

The recovered product is considered a flammable mixture under the rule. Regulated substances in the flammable mixture will include propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of propane at the facility is 3,200,000 pounds while butane, isobutane [propane, 2- methyl] and ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol) are present at the facility in quantities of 2,200,000 pounds, 510,000 pounds and 20,000 pounds, respectively. A flammable mixture will also be present at the facility. The maximum inventory of the flammable mixture will be 290,000 pounds. No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3. A number of processes at the facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - EGTS maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).

EGTS primarily uses the What-If method analysis technique to perform these hazard evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, EGTS maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Initial employee training is provided and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented and a record of training is maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical In"

An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - EGTS believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit - Hot work permits for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process are issued by facility safety leaders. The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed. The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nContractors - EGTS hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

In addition, they are familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures. Contractors are further informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. Emergency response information includes evacuation routes and personnel assembly points. EGTS documents that all contract personnel have received and understood the training.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps - The processes at Galmish have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility are in place to help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error. The facility has safety features on many units to help (a) contain/control a release (e.g., diking and enclosures); (b) quickly detect a release (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms), and (c) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release (e.g., fire suppression and extinguishing).\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Galmish facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nEGTS maintains a SharePoint website for Site Specific Emergency Plans (SSEP) for emergency response information on individual sites. This website is readily available for use on employee computer terminals and the emergency response plan is also conspicuously posted on bulletin boards for immediate access should an emergency response be required. Each written SSEP has an emergency plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances and is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.\n\n\n\nThe plan includes actions t"
