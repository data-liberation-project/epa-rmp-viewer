This facility complies with OSHA 1910.111 standard requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all\napplicaple federal, state and local laws and regulations. If an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Bradner\nFire Department and request that they respond. We are prepared to work with the Bradner Fire Department, or other \nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\n  This facility is a branch location of Luckey Farmers, Inc. We are a farmer-owned cooperative serving our member-\ncustomers by providing goods and services to assist them in producing agricultural products. One such product sold to\nproducers is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a crop production nutrient. The primary function of this facility is \nstorage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. On site are two 30,000 gallon storage tanks containing a maximum\ncapacity of 250,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and associated delivery tank-wagons and application equipment.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\nNot Applicable - EPA removed this requirement due to security concerns.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely incident is a break in a transfer hose from the storage tank\nto a delivery tank-wagon. In this scenario, 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released, resulting in an \nimpact zone endpoint distance of .4 mile. Within this impact zone are private dwellings with a population of 450, \nand an important highway (U.S. Route 6).\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program:\n  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\nAmmonia, K61.1 published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and t"

We have \nprovided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under\nSARA Title III. Awritten emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including\npre-emergency and employee training is in place. In the event an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the\nBradner Fire Department and request that they respond. We have discusses this with the fire department and a\nmember of the fire department has inspected this facility.\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process. Periodic evaluations are performed to review the preservation of safe \nconditions. Corrective actions are made if the evaluations warrant it. There are no additional anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
