The last seismic assessment was conducted in September 2021.  Recommendations were made to repair concrete, piping supports, and bolts of which several are being addressed in the scope of recent construction project involving the acrolein offloading platform and effluent piping towards the acrolein rail storage and vent lines to the flare.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors \u0096 Taft Manufacturing uses contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting any contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  To inform any contractor of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes on the site, and annual orientation is conducted, and records are maintained.  Additionally, embedded maintenance contractors are provided regular training on the written maintenance procedures and Preventative Maintenance Plan for the facility.  All Contractors are informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and safety data sheet (SDS) of all chemicals on-site are made available upon request. Each contractor submits their own site-specific health and safety plan to inform their own employees of the expectations for safe performance.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\nCompliance Audits \u0096 At least once every three years the PSM/RMP program is audited for effectiveness and implementation by a team from Baker Hughes corporate office.  The team follows known audit protocol and identifies any corrective actions required to ensure the integrity of the management system.  Actions resulting from audits are tracked in a database accessible to all employees, and are closed in a timely manner, typically within a year of the receipt of the audit report.  Audit findings are shared with all employees in a company meeting and updates on progress in completing recommendations are likewise shared.

The facility's primary activity is acrolein packaging, encompassing receiving and transfer of acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications, into bulk storage containers and shipping/dispenser containers.  We also rework and service the containers.  The acrolein is used as a pesticide and algaecide for crop protection and a sulfide scavenger, biocide, and corrosion inhibitor in oil field applications.\n\nProcesses at the facility are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] for Acrolein production, storage and loading processes containing more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  \n\nThe packaging process includes a truck rack for unloading incoming loads of acrolein in the packaging area.  ISO-containers of acrolein are received on flatbed truck trailers and unloaded into the railcar mounted ISO-containers for storage and packaging.  Although multiple ISO-containers on trailers can be held in storage at the plant, the process only allows for unloading of one at a time.\n\nThe process storage can have up to 30,000 lbs of acrolein present in a single ISO-container and a total of twelve (12) ISO \u0096 containers on the rail siding and up to ten (10) ISO-containers on truck chassis for temporary/overflow storage (36,000lbs/each).  \n\nIn the packaging area, the facility can hold approximately 1,800 individual containers of finished acrolein product staged for shipping to customers.  Approximately 130,000 lbs of acrolein is packaged per month, with variable daily rates of fill depending upon existing inventory and customer demand.\n\nBaker Hughes and Taft Manufacturing Co"
