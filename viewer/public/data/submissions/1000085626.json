All applicable procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  Ephrata Borough employees take safety seriously as stated in our mission statement.  \"Our mission, as Borough of Ephrata employees is to strive for excellence in protection and service, to accept challenges as opportunities to promote teamwork, affirming our commitment to the community.\"\n\n\n\n    The Borough of Ephrata's Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 (WWTP #1) Chlorination System was installed to disinfect the effluent flow from the plant to the Cocalico Creek to meet the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Limit for fecal coliform.  The Chlorine Building is a block building located to the west (back end of the Plant) just south of the Return Sludge Building at the WWTP #1.  WWTP #1 is located on the west side of  PA State Route 272,  at 405 South Reading Road across from the new Ephrata Public Library.  The Chlorine Building houses liquid chlorine in  two one ton cylinders on scales with chlorinators (vacuum regulator), a total residual chlorine feed system, various electrical panels, building exhaust fan, and an alarm system.  In case of a leak, call 911 for the Fire Company or Lancaster County HAZMAT Team for assistance.   Inside the chlorine building is a cradle holding one additional container which may be full or empty depending on the delivery schedule.  The WWTP is normally staffed weekdays 7:00 am to 6:00 pm with 8 personal.  On weekends and holidays an operator is on site performing only necessary checks and operations from 6:00 am to 2:pm.  One operator is always on call for handling emergencies and trouble alarms which may occur.  \n\n\n\n     The general WWTP #1 accident release prevention program is based on the following key elements:  \n\n "

This Plan includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  \n\n\n\n    Regular safety meetings are conducted monthly by the Borough of Ephrata's Safety Committee.  At that time recommendations are made for improved safety at the facility.  The most notable safety improvement for the chlorine handling was the return to a full vacuum system from the cylinder onward starting December 08, 2014, with a new Regal Chlorination and Analyser.  Additionally, the operator working directly with the equipment wears a personal protective breathing apparatus with chlorine resistant filters.  Finally, all pipes and fittings were replaced 10/31/2019 and 11/1/2019 to insure a fail-safe system. \n\n"
