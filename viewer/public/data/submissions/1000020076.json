      "SummaryText": "1.   The Exel,Inc. facility located at 5522 Little Richmond in Dayton, Ohio was built\n     for Hormel Foods as a refrigerated distribution center utilizing Anhydrous Ammonia.\n2.   The refrigeration system is run by an Allen-Bradley SLC-5 programmable logic controller\n     accessed by either an Allen-Bradley Panelview screen on the refrigeration control cabinet\n     or through a personal computer utilizing Wonderware software.  The system can also be\n     run manually through a series of Hand-Off-Auto switches located inside the refrigeration\n     control cabinet or through manual manipulation of the automatic control valves.\n3.   The operating temperature of the system will be +38 to -22 degrees Fahrenheit depending\n     upon the area.\n4.   The mechanical integrity of the system is maintained by a combination of routine inspections\n     conducted by refrigeration and maintenance contractors, and routine maintenance conducted to \n     industry and manufacturer standards and coordinated through use of the Faciliworks Maintenance\n     Manager program.\n5.   We are improving safety at the facility through more effective training for system operators \n     and maintenance technicians which conforms to the recommendations of the Refrigerating \n     Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA)as well as the International Institute of Ammonia \n     Refrigeration (IIAR). This will include increased use of formal industrial refrigeration \n     training facilities such as those offered by Garden City Community College of Garden City,\n     Kansas and Lanier Technical College of Oakwood, GA.\n6.   There has not been an accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility in the past \n     five years."
