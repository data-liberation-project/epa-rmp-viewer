This guidance complies with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nSection 112( r ) requires facilities which store certain toxic or flammable chemicals above threshold quantities to develop and implement an RMP.  The RMP evaluates the worst case and alternative case release of these chemicals  into the environment and the impact on surrounding human populations and environmental receptors.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all of the toxic substance within a vessel, system or process is released at one time.  The alternative case scenario assumes a smaller, more realistic, release of perhaps on cylinder or container.  The RMP also evaluates the facility's resources to cope with chemical releases.  Although the RMP present worst case and alternative case scenarios, it should be noted that there has never been an incident at the ECRWWTF which resulted in any offsite consequences or injury to human health or the environment.\n\nThe City's water treatment plant located at Clear Lake, treats surface water from the Water Catchment Area (WCA) and the L-8 Canal.  It provides potable water to the City of West Palm Beach, the Town of Palm Beach and South Palm Beach, and to some unincorporated ares of Palm Beach County.  Current water use ranges between 20 and 40  million gallons per day (mgd).  The water plant can treat up to 47 mgd, which is expected to be sufficient to meet its future water demands.\n\nThe original water system was developed by Henry Flagler in 1894 to serve the hostoric Royal Ponciana Hotel.  The first water treatment plant was constructed in 1921.  The City of West Palm Beach purchsed the plant "

Over the next several years the water treatment plant will be working on a $16 million program to continually upgrade and modify the treatment process and safety to meet the proposed rerquirement of the Safe Drinking Water Act and other federal legislation.\n\nThe water treatment plant physically and chemically treats raw intake water to produce a potable water which meets standards of the Safe Water Drinking Act.\n\nChlorine and ammonia are both used at this facility at quantities above the EPS -- List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention, and thus both chlorine and ammonia are the basis of this RMP.  \n\nThe maximum amount of liquid chlorine onsite at anyone time during normal operation is 36,000 pounds.  Chlorine cylinders are stored in a state-of-the-art chlorine building equipped with a computerized leak detection system and a chlorine leak scrubber system.  If a leak develops inside the building the leak detection system sends an alarm to the control room and activates the scrubber system.  All vents and louvers in the building automatically close.  The air within the building is drawn through the scrubber system which neutralizes the chlorine gas with a sodium hydroxide solution.  Chlorine is used in the treatment process to produce potable water.  Chlorine is added to the water as a disinfectant to kill pathogenic bacteria.  During normal operattions six (6) on ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine containers are in use at one time, plus six (6) containers are on standby with container valves closed, and six (6) more are in storage.  The chlorine is stored int eh containers as a liquid under pressure, but is discharged into the water as a gas.\n\nChlorine is one of the chemical elements and is one of the halogens.

Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant.  In sufficient concentrations, the gas irritates the mucous membranes, the respiratory system and skin.  At higher levels there is vomiting associated with labored breathing.  In extreme cases difficulty breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from suffocation.\n\nChlorine is also hazardous to the environment.  Chlorine causes bleached spots on leafy palnts due to an attack on chlorophyll in the leaf.  Mammanlian animals suffer many of the same effects as humans exposed to chlorine.  Many forms of aquatic animal life are adversely agffected by chlorine in concentrations well below 0.1 ppm, but harmful concentrations are unlikely unless chlorine is discharged directly in to the water.\n\nThe maximum amount of ammonia onsite at any one time is 21,250 pounds.  The ammonia tanks are located in a state-of-the-art ammonia building with a computerized leak detection system and an ammonia leak scribber system.  If a leak develops inside the building the leak detection system sends an alarm to the control room and activates the scrubber system.  All vents in the building automatically close.  The air within the building is drawn throught the scrubber system which cleans the air of ammonia gas using water as the reactant.  The water ammonai solution is then discharged to the sanitary sewer system for disposal.  Ammonia is used in the treatment process to produce potable.  Ammonia is added to the water to aid in the disinfecting procees. By adding ammonia to the water the amount of daily chlorine consumption is reduced.

Ammonia gas may become flammable or explosive when exposed to oxygen enriched environments or strong oxidizing materials.  Ammonia will react violently many different chemical compounds and metals.  Ammonia storage rooms must be kept free of stong oxidizers and combustible materials.  Ammonia is a hazardous materila that can cause severe injury or death if released into the atmosphere.
