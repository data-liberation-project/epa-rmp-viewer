Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\nThe Plains LPG Services L.P., Lone Star Fractionation & Isomerization facility is committed to conducting their operation in a safe and responsible manner. The facility will conduct operations in compliance with applicable industry standards, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The facility personnel are trained and prepared to respond to operational emergencies safely and effectively, minimizing the risk to personnel, the public, and the community-at-large. The facility ensures that their emergency response plans and capabilities are compatible with the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\n2. The facility and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe facility is approximately 40 acres in size and is located approximately 10 miles northwest of Bakersfield, California and 7 miles south of Shafter, California. The plant processes liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into a mixture of normal butane, propane, natural gasoline, and isobutane. The specific regulated substances handled by the facility are: butane, isobutane, propane, and pentane (natural gasoline), hydrogen and ethyl mercaptan. The butamer unit converts normal butane into isobutane using a platinum catalyst. The resulting butane/isobutane mix is then sent to the deisobutanizer unit for separation. The isobutane is separated from the mixture and sent to storage as a final product for sale as a feedstock. The normal butane is returned to the process for recycling. All units are interconnected and considered to be a single LPG processing plant. The hydrogen unit produces hydrogen that is used in the butamer reaction. Steam and natural gas are reacted together to produce hydrogen and other byproducts. The hydrogen is then purified and sent to the butamer unit. The specific processes used in the production of isobutane ar"

Heat for the butamer and deisobutanizer processes is provided by a hot oil system using a stable hydrocarbon as the heating medium. The facility has storage and truck and rail loading/ unloading operations for raw materials and product. Process 2 consists of the storage of railcars at the facility.\r\n\r\n3. Accidental release prevention program:\r\nThe facility's accidental release prevention program is modeled after and in compliance with federal and state programs for managing hazardous chemical processes. It meets the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management standard, EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, and the state Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). Specific elements of the program include: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Safety, Contractor and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. Specific accident prevention steps include the following programs, procedures, and practices:\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit procedure\r\n\u00bf\tConfined Space Entry procedure\r\n\u00bf\tLockout/Tagout Procedure\r\n\u00bf\tCode of Safe Work Practices\r\n\u00bf\tRespiratory Protection Program\r\n\u00bf\tHazwoper program/ Hazcom program\r\n\u00bf\tProcedure for opening process equipment and piping\r\n\u00bf\tControlled/limited access to facility and process areas.\r\n\u00bf\tIntegrity testing and inspection of process equipment/piping\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee participation in the MOC process and PHA.\r\n\u00bf\tUnrestricted access to process safety information by employees and contractors.\r\n\u00bf\tOperator training program which includes initial, OJT, and refresher training and demonstration of competency.\r\n\u00bf\tPeriodic training on selected health, safety, and environmental topics.\r\n\u00bf\tInitial and annual training in PSM and emergency act"

The five-year accident history:\r\nThe Lone Star Fractionation & Isomerization facility didn't have any incidents covered by the RMP rule in the last five years (2017 - 2022) . \r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program:\r\nThe emergency response program is written and posted in a dedicated binder which is located in the control room, safety office and the training room. The plan describes the evacuation procedures, the emergency actions to take, individual responsibilities during an emergency, and the appropriate notifications and contacts to make for specific types of emergency events. Plant evacuations are initiated by activating an audible signal (horn). The signal can be activated from an outside alarm station or from the main office. The plan is reviewed and coordinated with the Kern County Fire Department on a periodic basis. The facility has an emergency response team made up of operating/maintenance personnel and a team coordinator (Safety and Environmental Supervisor). Team members receive annual training on their assigned responsibilities in the ERP and the appropriate levels hazardous waste and emergency response operations (29 CFR 1910.120 - HAZWOPER). The team has emergency action plan drills and exercises at least annually and hands-on drills with the emergency equipment periodically. Maintenance and testing of the emergency equipment is scheduled in the facility's computerized maintenance management system and performed by the maintenance personnel at the appropriate interval.\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety include: 1) Implementing recommendations from the latest PHA revalidation and the latest Compliance Audit; 2) Continuing the effort to review/update the facility operating procedures; and 3) Continuing the effort to review/update the facility Process Safety information."
