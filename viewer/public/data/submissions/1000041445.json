If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizer for use by farmers. The maximum quantity stored would be 161,662 pounds in our 2 storage tanks(1-26,000 galllon, 1-10,000gallon).  In addition to this we have 61,166 pounds of capacity in rolling stock (14 tanks of 1000 gallon water capacity figured at 85%, which is the maximum filled capacity with NH3).  The total for this facility is 222,828 pounds.  The largest amount handled would be 41,000 pounds in the form of a delivery to our bulk plant by semi.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternate release scenarios have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is for Security reaons and falls under the Homeland Security Act.  \n\n\n\n We believe that the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safety record. \n\n  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant proper damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and we report all regulated materials to the Community Right to Know program, the local fire department and the County LEPC.  Several of our employees are members and officers with the local volunteer fire department.  We feel this cross training serves us well in the area of emergency preparedness.  \n\n\n\nOur company rules do not allow employees to respond to any emergency requiring the use of a "
