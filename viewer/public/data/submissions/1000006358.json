      "SummaryText": "Sterigenics US LLC previously contracted Radian International, Inc. (Radian) to assist in addressing the requirements under the federal Risk Management Program as mandated in the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r )(7).  The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics completed an update of the original RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMPeSubmit.  A copy of the submittal is included in Section 9.0 of this document.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\nA? Introduction;\nA? Facility identification and regulated substances;\nA? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\nA? Hazard Assessment;\nA? Prevention Program;\nA? Five-Year Accident History;\nA? Emergency Response Plan; and\nA? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located Smyrna.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under US EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activ"

Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program \n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the US EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68). The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\nA? Process safety information is accessible to employees at all times.\nA? A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparation for RMP compliance.\nA? Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\nA? Door interlock system.\nA? Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\nA? Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\nA? A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\nA? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\nA? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\nA? A thorough Preventative Maintenance program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\n\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the Sterigenics US LLC - Smyrna facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, door interlock system, and explosion-proof electrical systems.  \n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  Sterigenics also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of"

These scenarios are included within Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis). \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n1. The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\nA? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\nA? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nSterigenics US LLC - Smyrna has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Sterigenics US LLC - Smyrna facility are coordinated with the Cobb County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" Sterigenics US LLC - Smyrna also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics' activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this ti"

Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves. Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and some of the chamber doors that will alarm with an audible alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
