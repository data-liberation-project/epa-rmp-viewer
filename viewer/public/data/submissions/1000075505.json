The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Albertsons undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review \r\n\r\nAlbertsons is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Portland distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation , and maintenance of the system. Albertsons' employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at New Albertsons should be addressed to the New Albertsons Environmental Affairs Department. Albertsons has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP Regulations."
