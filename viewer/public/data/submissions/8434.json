The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenario.\n\nScenario: The Epichlorohydrin spill. \n\nPacific Epoxy Polymers receives its epichlorohydrin from tank wagons that come in without any pressure on them and are equipped with only dry disconnect valves.   If the vessels come in with pressure, the operator in charge of the unloading has to carefully release the pressure through controlled measures to avoid a hose from being blown off.\n\nIf by chance the pressure gauge was reading zero pounds of pressure and the actual pressure inside the vessel was over 15 pounds of pressure, an accidental release of epichlorohydrin could occur.  The operator, following the guidelines to offload epichlorohydrin, checks to see if the wagon has pressure and reads zero pounds.  As he opens the valve to start pumping the raw material into the bulk storage tank, the pressure built up inside the vessel blows the hose off the tank wagon spraying epichlorohydrin inside the building.  \n\nRemedy: The first thing the operator would have to do is to close the valve on the wagon using the emergency shut off valve located near the front of the tank wagon if he can get to it without putting himself in more danger.  Then evacuate the area and notify all personnel of the immediate dangers associated with the incident and evacuate the buildings.  Using the Emergency Response plan, that Pacific Epoxy Polymers created for a step by step guide dealing with an emergency situation, notify the proper authorities and agencies for the necessary clean up.  While waiting for the Hazwop team to arrive, the plant personnel with the help of the Richmond Fire Department would set up boundaries to keep harm from any individual.  MSDS's would be distributed to the incoming Hazwop team and a decontamination center would also be set up.  Once the Hazwop team arrives, the authority would be transferred from Pacific Epoxy Polymers to them with the employees standing"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Pacific Epoxy Polymers, INC. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pacific Epoxy Polymers, INC..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPacific Epoxy Polymers, INC. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPacific Epoxy Polymers, INC. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Part"

The employees check all gauges and if they suspect that a gauge is wrong, then the truck is rejected or inspected by a more trained individual.\n\nScenario: The Formaldehyde Spill\n\nA tote of formaldehyde had a faulty valve which gave way during the weekend allowing the 5000 pounds of 37% formaldehyde to spill onto the floor.  The maintenance walks into this situation on Sunday then immediately evacuates the area.\n\nRemedy: The first thing the maintenance man would do is to evacuate the area and notify all personnel of the immediate dangers associated with the incident.
