      "SummaryText": "The owners of Independent Farm Services are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Overbrook Rural Fire department, and the Osage County LEPC to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary function of this facility is to use agricultural fertilizers for growing crops.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and used as a fertilizer for crop production.\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with the local emergency responders.  The distance to endpoints have also been shared with these authorities.  Our partners have also been trained to assist emergency responders in the event of an anhydrous ammonia release. To prevent accidental releases our partners are complying with the Kansas Department of Agriculture rules and regulations.\n\nThere has not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOur facility has a written emergency action plan included with our RMP Compliance Manual.  Additionally, all partners dealing with anhydrous ammonia at our facility have been trained and tested competent.  Safety awareness is an ongoing process at our facility.  Maintenance and safety evaluations are performed to assess the facilities condition.  At this time, the planned changes to improve safety include installation of collision protection around piping."
