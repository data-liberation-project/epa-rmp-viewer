Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care \u00ae.\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility has 3 processes that involve regulated substances.\n\nThe Synthetic Size process makes resins that are used to produce consumer paper products such as paper plates and bathroom tissue.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is formaldehyde soulution (37 %).\nThe Surface Size process makes coatings that are used in the manufacture of high quality paper such as that found in magazines.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is ammonium hydroxide solution.\n\nThe Specialty Chemicals process makes water-soluble organic polymers that are used to remove solids from a number of different wastewater applications.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is ammonium hydroxide solution\n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of Paramel Reactor and the release of 3,890 pounds of formaldehyde solution (37 %). The formaldeyhde released could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde is the failure of a pipeline during unloading and the release of 2,752 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike, drain, sump, neutralization and an emergency shutdown system were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The cloud formed by"

The evaporating ammonium hydroxide could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n\u00b7 EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n\u00b7 OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\u00b7 OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n\u00b7 Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\u00b7 Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n\u00b7 Cytec Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent a release of ammonium hydroxide.\n- Storage tank high level alarm\n- Loading/unloading vapor return system\n- Written process instructions for using aqua ammonia\n- Diking around the storage tank\n- Storage tank equipped with conservation vent \n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls help prevent a release of formaldehyde solution.\n- Storage tank designed to API 620 specifications\n- Storage tank high level alarm\n- Diking around storage tank\n- Loading/unloading vapor return system\n- Written process instructions for using formaldehyde\n\n(e) 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no incidents at the Mobile Plant that meet the criteria for reporting in the five-year accident history.\n\n(f) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cytec Mobile Plant maintains emergency procedures that are designed to protect, to the greatest extent possible, the employees of the plant and the surrounding community."

      "SummaryText": "The procedures are designed to be implemented in case of fire, explosion, chemical release which may arise as a result of our own operations, adjacent operations or the forces of nature.  These procedures are set up to be implemented in two primary areas; 1.) In plant and 2.) in conjunction with the community.\n\n The in plant portion of the emergency response plan provides for employee notification of an emergency through an alarm system and in plant response with a trained emergency response team.  The in plant emergency response protocols also provide for communications, notifications, procedures for emergency shut down, and mitigation.  The in plant system is tested on a frequency ranging from weekly, for the alarm and communications system, to bi-annually for in-plant musters and drills.\n\nIn addition to the in plant portion of the emergency response plan, the Mobile Plant also maintains an active community based emergency response program.  This is done through monthly participation in the Mobile County LEPC as well as with the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency which coordinates mutual aid for the entire Mobile area chemical manufacturing community.  Participation is achieved through planning meetings, public forums, bi-annual countywide emergency drills.  The Cytec Plant also interfaces frequently with community based emergency response groups such as the fire department and local hazardous materials response team.  Plant tours and readiness evaluations for these organizations are conducted on an annual basis.\n\n(g) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.   We are also executing a well-organized plan to ensure minimum possible negative impact from Y2K. \n\nSpecific capital improvements currently planned that will directly improve safety in the plant include:\n\n-Fully automated"
