It is a Weyerhaeuser standard that every company facility that purchases, uses or manufactures chemical products and materials which are required by law to have Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must: (1) Use the company standard software to manage MSDS for chemicals and chemical materials used in the workplace; (2) Implement site-specific chemical approval and receiving processes; (3) Document the function, use and safe handling procedures of all approved chemicals on site; (4) Maintain a formal procedure for receiving chemicals on-site; (5) Maintain records of chemical use, disposal, employee training and health risk exposure assessments; (6) Adhere to the Company No New Purchases and Restricted Use Only guidelines for chemicals and chemical materials.      \n\nThe mill handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmetal Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). The mill also complies with the OSHA PSM rule as it relates to anhydrous ammonia.  The anhyrous ammonia is used at the mill cogeneration plant, which is part of the selective catalytic reduction system that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the cogeneration plant turbine.  \n\nThe mill has experienced no reportable incidents in the last five years involving the anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe mill has an onsite Emergency Response Team, which is trained to respond to a variety of environmental-, safety-, and health-related incidents."
