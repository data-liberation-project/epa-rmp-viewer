      "SummaryText": "1.  Cooperative Grain & Supply Policy\n\nThe Management and employees of Cooperative Grain & Supply, Canton facility, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur,  Cooperative Grain & Supply has in place a memorandum of understanding with the local fire department.  This agreement calls for a joint response and mitigation of any release thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility information - East facility located south of Highway 56 (former Collingwood facility)\n\nThe primary acitvity at this site is the storage of agricultural commodities, livestock feed, and crop production products for sale to farmers and ranchers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application.  The maximum quantity handled would be 134,000 pounds  in one 18,000 gallons vessel and one 12,388 gallon vessel.  In addition there are 20 nurse tanks with a total of 88,000 pounds(4400lbs per tank), making a grand total of 222,000 pounds of storage at any one time.  \n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst case release scenario would be the  release of the total contents of a storage vessel released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.17 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on the potential incident resulting in a release from a break in a two inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCooperative Grain & Supply has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.;  the standards o"

The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the Canton facility.  Furthermore; to our knowledge, there have been no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering inplace, property damage or environmental damage caused by this facility.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cooperative Grain & Supply, Canton facility, has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's standard (29 CFR 1910.38).  The Cooperative Grain & Supply has provided to the Kansas Department of Health & Environment and the McPherson County local emergency planning committee the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required by SARA Title III (EPCRA).  The Cooperative Grain & Supply has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA's standard (29 CFR 1910.120) including a memorandum of understanding with the  Canton Fire Department for response to our facility.  Additionally, the Cooperative Grain & Supply has trained its employees in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste O0perations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.,  Periodic evaluations (at least annually)  will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditons.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at the time.\n\n\nFor further information, contact:\n\n\n\nLyman L. Adams, Jr.\nGeneral Manager"
