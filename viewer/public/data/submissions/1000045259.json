Prairie Horizon Agri-Energy, LLC (PHAE) has been in operation since August 2006, there has not been a change in management since the start of operation.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nPHAE has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs. \n\n\n\nPHAE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP); Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC); Facility Response Plan (FRP); that outline procedures for spill response. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. These Plans also detail best management practices in place at the facility, i.e. good housekeeping, prompt routine equipment maintenance and inspections.\n\n\n\nPHAE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for PHAE is Vicki Hanchett, EHS Manager of PHAE. Her work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are below:\n\n\n\nJo"

The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance stored at the facility is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant). \n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\n\n\n1. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in a 100,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 560,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.5 mile radius and are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tank contents, (equaling 560,000 pounds of the flammable mixture) only 190,400 pounds were used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Public receptors information was obtained using Circular Area Profiles (CAPS). No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, ca"

      "SummaryText": "using a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were 0.2 miles and are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents (42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture) only 14,280 pounds were used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112(r). Public receptor information was obtained using CAPS. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe PHAE facility qualifies as a Program 3 for the flammable mixture (denaturant) due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nPHAE's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations.  Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports per KDHE requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with the RMP covered process at the PHAE facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nPHAE has several "

PHAE takes the third-party audit findings very seriously and attempts to implement all recommended changes on a timely basis.  At the time of this RMP resubmission, PHAE has no planned changes to improve safety.\n\n"
