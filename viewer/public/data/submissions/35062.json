      "SummaryText": "-regulated flammable substances collectively.\n\nIn performing the offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, Evans Harvey used EPA's RMP*Comp software.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\"\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nFor the RMP-regulated toxic substances, the worst-case scenario is a release of 44,000 pounds of a liquid hydrazine and water solution from a transportation container (referred to as an ISO tote).  The solution is approximately 60 weight% hydrazine (i.e., 26,400 pounds of hydrazine).  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool that is completely contained within a diked area.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nFor the RMP-regulated flammable substances, the worst-case scenario is a release of 410 pounds of trimethylamine from a drum.  The released material ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The pressure wave resulting from the explosion is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the RMP-regulated toxic substances, an alternative release scenario is required to be presented in the risk management plan for hydrazine; acrylonitrile; 2,4-toluene diisocyanate; 2,6-toluene diisocyanate; and toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrazine is an unloading hose failure that releases 4,600 pounds of liquid hydrazine/water solution (2,760 pounds of hydrazine) over a 10-minute period (the time required for the operators to isolate the release).  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool that is completely contained within a diked area.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is a release of 180 pounds of liquid from a drum over a 5-minute period (the time required"

The released liquid forms an evaporating pool.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for 2,6-toluene diisocyanate is a railcar unloading hose failure that releases 2,750 pounds over a 10-minute period (the time required for the operators to isolate the release).  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) is a railcar unloading hose failure that releases 2,750 pounds over a 10-minute period (the time required for the operators to isolate the release).

The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nFor the RMP-regulated flammable substances, only one alternative release scenario is required to be reported in the risk management plan.  A spill of 610 pounds (two drums) of isopropylamine is selected as the alternative release scenario.  The liquid pool formed by the release ignites, resulting in a pool fire.  The thermal radiation generated by the pool fire is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEvans Harvey has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP rule (40 CFR 68).

(Evans Harvey) are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Evans Harvey facility's primary activities are repackaging and warehousing of chemicals. Evans Harvey either repackages or warehouses up to 9 RMP-regulated substances at our facility.  Evans Harvey receives the regulated substances in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are either warehoused or shipped, depending on customer specifications.  The inventories of RMP-regulated substances present at the facility are dependent upon customer orders, and not all regulated substances are present on site at a given time.  The following summarizes (1) the RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances that may exceed the RMP threshold quantity at the facility, (2) the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers associated with the regulated substances, and (3) the maximum quantities of RMP-regulated substances that may be at the facility:\n\n\nRMP Toxic Substances                               CAS No.        Maximum Quantity (pounds)\n\nAcrylonitrile                                                  107-13-1        86,000\nHydrazine                                                    302"

The RMP-regulated processes at the Evans Harvey facility are subject to the Program 2 requirements of the RMP rule.  The Program Level 2 requirements apply because the worst-case scenario for the process reaches nearby public receptors (e.g., industrial neighbors) and the processes are (1) not subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and (2) not associated with any of the high risk North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes listed in the RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that an offsite consequence analysis be performed for hypothetical releases of RMP-regulated substances at the facility.  For Program 2 processes, the RMP rule requires that one worst-case release scenario be presented in the risk management plan for each hazard class (i.e., one toxic scenario and one flammable scenario).  The RMP rule also requires that more likely release scenarios, referred to as alternative release scenarios, be presented in the risk management plan.  One alternative release scenario must be presented for each RMP-regulated toxic substance at the facility, and one alternative release scenario must be presented for the RMP"
