The management and employees of the Hillsboro facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Trichlorosilane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of Trichlorosilane into DOT containers for distribution to customers. Trichlorosilane is received and stored in a 6,000 gallon (67,200 lb) tank.  The Trichlorosilane is then filled into various size DOT containers for distribution to customers.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of the 6,000 gallon Trichlorosilane Tank. The result would be a maximum release of 67,200 lbs of Trichlorosilane over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of  1 psi overpressurization was determined to be 0.1 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 0 residents and no special based on the actual observations & 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".  One business / industry is within the endpoint. The business is Ashland Chemical Warehouse. No environmental receptors are affected.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was determined involved the rupturing/breaking of the trichlorosilane fill hose during filling of the tank from a road trailer. This release would result in the 30 second release of 20 gallons (228 lb) of Trichlorosilane prior to the acti"

(1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would affect 0 residents and one businesses based on actual observations. The business would the Ashland Chemical Warehouse. No residents were affect by this scenario.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, Excess Flow Valves and Emergency Shut-off Valves on the Delivery vehicle,  a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, scrubbers, and safeties.\n\nThere was one reportable accident in the past five years. The incident happen on November 14, 1997 at 2 pm. The incident involved the release 2 pounds of trichlorosilane which cause a minor injury to a worker. No property damage, death or other injuries occurred. There was no off-site injuries, death, damage or evacuation. \n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Trichlorosilane.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the Trichlorosilane system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.

The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was review and updated on May 10, 1996 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on February 4, 1999 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA\u0012s hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.

The training program was last reviewed in February 1999.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in February 1999.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on July 31, 1998.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.

This program was review in February 1999.\n\nHazardous work or nonroutine work is controlled in a consistent manner.  The hazards identified is communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The BOC Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in February 1999 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\".  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.  Management of Change procedures were review in February 1999.\n\nProcess incidents which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of Trichlorosilane are investigated, including \"near misses\", within 48 hours of the incident.  The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mis"
