One of CCWA\u00c2\u00bfs goals included in the mission statement is to \u00c2\u00bfMinimize environmental impacts and protect the environment during operation of our facilities\u00c2\u00bf.  It is CCWA\u00c2\u00bfs intent to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials through a comprehensive program of training, preventive maintenance and proper use of materials and equipment.  Should an accidental release occur, CCWA will continue to be prepared to control and mitigate all resultant occurrences.\n\nSystem Description:\nCCWA has taken several measures to insure safe containment of all bulk chemicals used at the PPWTP, with chlorine being one of those chemicals and is covered by this RMP.   All bulk chemical containers are securely fastened to concrete pedestals and have full secondary containment.  Separate containment is specified for acids and bases.  Additionally, all chemical feed lines are in secondary containment conduits that empty back to the main secondary containment structures.  Feed systems and tank data are monitored by a SCADA system with full alarm capability.  High priority alarms are audible with an automatic phone call out capability when acknowledgement does not occur within 3 minutes of the initial alarm.  Each critical piece of equipment is backed up with standby equipment in ready to run mode.  Stand-by equipment also includes an emergency generator that will power the entire PPWTP in the event that the main electric power is lost.\n\nThe chlorine system has been designed to minimize the potential for chlorine release.  Chlorine is fed from four one-ton cylinders using the\u00c2\u00bf gas\u00c2\u00bf valve connection point"

Using this configuration limits chlorine draw to 400 pounds per day (faster withdrawals will freeze the valve and manifold, further limiting withdrawal rates).  A pneumatic valve actuator is attached immediately after leaving the cylinders, allowing for the capability for an emergency shut- down from outside the chlorine storage room.  The chlorine system converts to a vacuum system after the pneumatic valves.  Any leaks in a vacuum system will draw ambient air into the lines instead of allowing chlorine to escape.  A leak in the vacuum system will draw ambient air into the lines instead of allowing chlorine to escape.  A leak in the vacuum system also shuts down the chlorination system and alarms will triggered on the SCADA system, notifying staff.\n\nThere are two separate rooms associated with the chlorine delivery system.  One room is for cylinder storage and the other room is for feed control.  Both rooms are serviced by a chlorine scrubber system.  This system neutralizes the chlorine atmosphere by pumping the contaminated air out of the room and scrubbing it through a column of caustic soda (the chemical reaction of chlorine and caustic soda forms sodium chloride).  This system is capable of neutralizing an entire one ton cylinder of chlorine without replacing the caustic soda.   The scrubber\u00c2\u00bfs caustic solution is monitored so the desired percentage specified by the manufacture is maintained.\n\nEmergency Response Plan:\nCCWA policy dictates that any release beyond small gasket or valve packing leaks will be handled by a multi-agency hazardous materials response unit.  This unit is comprised of various San Luis Obispo County (SLOC) fire departments and the California Department of Forestry (CDF).  CDF will be the first emergency responder on site.\n\nIf an accidental chlorine release arises at the PPWTP, 911 will be dialed by the designated employee, the PPWTP administrative assistant during normal hours, backed by the PPWTP supervisor.

The response to the emergency will be determined by the problem parameters.  CDF from the Shandon Station will be the initial responders 9which is located approximately 2o minutes from the PPWTP, with other units and technical advisers dispatched as required.  CCWA staff will consult with and advise the incident commander assigned to the site or act in any capacity that personnel are trained and knowledgeable in.\n\nExcept for very small leaks that are below the detectable limits of the chlorine detectors set points, as noted above, the CCWA staff will wait for the directions of the emergency responders.  In all instances of detected chlorine release above the chlorine detectors set threshold limits, the chlorine scrubber will be automatically activated.  \nTraining:\nTraining is an important aspect of preparedness.  All staff members are trained to the first responder awareness level (FRA) to react to hazardous releases.  As mentioned above, a multi-agency response will probably occur due to a large release, with the CDF being first on-site.  The local CDF staff visit and inspect the PPWTP annually.  While at the facility, a tour of the facility is given with an in-depth explanation of the chlorine process.   CCWA has provided opportunities for CDF staff to train at the PPWTP site and invites their emergency personnel to any chlorine related training.   CCWA staff members review safe chlorine handling, hazardous materials response, rescue simulations, and other safety-related topics on an annual basis.  A chlorine \u00c2\u00bfB\u00c2\u00bf kit is kept on site for the use by emergency responders it they deem it necessary.\n\nPPWTP staff has been trained on the proper response to a chlorine leak, including all information necessary to provide during the initial 911 call, advised and participated in quarterly evacuation drills, as well a"
