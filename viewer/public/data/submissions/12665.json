The worst case release scenario for Chlorine would be the failure of a pressurized chlorine cylinder valve, and the sudden release of it's contents (2000lbs) in 10 minutes. The distance would 0.9 miles as estmated by the EPA's PMP* Comp.\n\n  The alternative release scenario would be avalve sheared off releasing 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine in 15 minutes.
