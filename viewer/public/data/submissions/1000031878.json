      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n \r\n\r\nA.  It is the policy of the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Corn Processing Facility, Marshall, Minnesota, to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release of pentane and chlorine and in the unlikely event of a release to minimize the potential impact to ADM's employees, the public, and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Marshall Fire Department and Lyon County Emergency Planning and Advisory Committee.  \r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThis facility consists of a Corn Wet Milling plant that processes corn into value added products such as corn sweeteners, fuel ethanol, and dry specialty products. \r\n\r\nIn this update of the Risk Management Plan, ADM has removed anhydrous sulfur dioxide from the facility.  In doing so chlorine becomes ADM-Marshalls worst case scenario and has updated the scenarios for the off-site consequence analysis. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the regulated substances used at this facility are now chlorine and pentane (n-pentane & 1-pentane).  Chlorine is used as a bacterial inhibitor in process cooling water.  Pentate is a component of the natural gasoline used in the denaturant for fuel ethanol production.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis, ADM used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP*COMP version 2.01. \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario Toxic Substances: For multiple toxic substances subject to Program 3 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated for the toxic substance estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint. The worst-c"

      "SummaryText": "ase scenario for substances that are normally gases at ambient temperatures but are liquefied by pressure assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically and the entire contents are released as a gas over a ten-minute period resulting in offsite impacts.  The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from an on-site chlorine cylinder.  Safe handling procedures, work practices and the safety devices inherent in the design of the containers make this scenario extremely unlikely.\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario: EPA requires that one alternative scenario, or more realistic scenario, be evaluated for each toxic substance.  EPA also requires that each alternative scenario result in off-site impacts, if such a scenario exists.  \r\n\r\nA more realistic release scenario involving pentane would be a break in the line supplying liquid denaturant from the storage tank to the process, or a storage tank leak.  \r\n\r\nA more realistic release scenario for chlorine involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails) connected to a one-ton container. The cylinder would then be released inside an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air. No active mitigation mesures were considered for this scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario Flammable Substances:  For multiple flammable substances subject to Program 3 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated for the flammable substance estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint. The worst-case scenario for substances that are normally liquids at ambient temperatures assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically and the entire contents are released.  The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from a denaturant (natural gasoline) storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch).  Safe handling procedures, work practices and the fire-protecti"

This liquid leak would be contained via the secondary containment dike surrounding the storage tank, or via excess flow checks within the process piping. \r\n\r\n\r\nD.  Accidental Release Prevention\r\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention programs are the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Program under 29 CFR 1910.119, which all of this facility's RMP processes are subject.  These concepts include: employee participation, analysis of hazards, operating procedures and safe work practices, personnel training, maintenance and mechanical integrity programs, and contractor programs.  \r\n\r\n\r\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\r\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving chlorine or pentane that require reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.  Emergency Response Program\r\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM personnel, the LEPC, and the City of Marshall Fire Department so that effective response measures will be implemented in the event of an emergency.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan regarding release prevention and releases of hazardous materials.  The facility is also an active member of the Lyon County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAs a result of a safety review of this facility's pentane and chlorine systems a variety of improvements have been made including the installation of a chlorine detection system.\r\n\r\nADM will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety at the Marshall facility."
