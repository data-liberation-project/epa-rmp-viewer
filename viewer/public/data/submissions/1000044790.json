It is Western Power and Steam, Inc.'s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations. Further, it is Western Power and Steam, Inc.'s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\r\n\r\nWestern Power and Steam, Inc. emphas safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs. In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, hazardous materials handling, safe work methods, and safe use of equipment. Additionally, emergency response procedures have been established by Western Power and Steam, Inc.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Western Power and Steam, Inc. cogeneration facility is owned and operated by Western Power and Steam, Inc. The plant, which is located in the Kern River Oil Field, northeast of Bakersfield, California, began commercial operation in the spring of 1990.\r\n\r\nCogeneration, in the case of the Western Power and Steam, Inc. facility, is the simultaneous production of thermal energy and electrical energy from the combustion of a single fuel source. Combustion of the fuel takes place in a gas turbine that is physically coupled to an electric generator. Waste heat from the gas turbine's exhaust flows into a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The HRSG extracts the heat from the exhaust gases and produces steam for thermally enhanced oil recovery. Electricity is produced at the same time via the electric generator coupled to the combustion turbine.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the Western Power and Steam, Inc. facility to create a reducing atmosphere in the SCR process. This reducing atmos"

The operation of the SCR system substantially lowers the emissions of nitrogen oxides from the gas turbine.\r\n\r\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 12,417 gallon (water capacity) storage tank. The maximum intended inventory of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank is based on the American National Standard Institute's K61.1 safety requirements and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in Section 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR). These standards and regulations limit the maximum ammonia storage capacity of the tank to approximately 57,900 pounds.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/I (200 ppm).\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Western Power and Steam, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia system. The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n\u00bf  Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\r\n\r\n\u00bf  An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and has been updated and revalidated.\r\n\r\n\u00bf  Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\r\n\r\n\u00bf  Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\r\n\r\n\u00bf  Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\r\n\r\n\u00bf  Written mechanical integrity procedures have b"
