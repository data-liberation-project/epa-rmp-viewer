Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states.  Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue Farms also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U.S. grain companies.  Perdue also, manufactures edible oils, speciality feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms Washington facility is located in Daviess County, Indiana, east of the town of Washington.  The facility is a poultry processing plant which employs approximately 800 associates to receive live turkeys and to slaughter, chill and package them as whole birds, cut-up parts or deboned product for shipment to market.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Washington facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the facility in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 63,208 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illiness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and well"

Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including the release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures plan (SPCC) and a Process Safety Management plan (PSM) as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves local managers and a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Director of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe Perdue Farms Washington facility maintains a Process Safety Management plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe predicted worst-case scenario for the refrigeration system is a castastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) located in the rear of the plant, outside the compressor room.  The vessel has a maximum storage capacity of 13,204 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Using RMP Comp modeling software, the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.5 miles, affecting residents, several schools, parks, recreation areas, agricultural land, city water treatment plant and the city wastewater treatment plant.  The estimated population within the 1.5 mile-radius is 772, based on information"

      "SummaryText": " provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and the local Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were considered.  A total of five release scenarios were chosen for further examination based on potential probability to cause a release.  The five refrigeration system components that were deemed to cause a probable alternative release scenario are:\n\n     1> Leak from the Condensing Towers\n     2> Leak from the 8.7 Receiver\n     3> Leak from the Brine Chiller Surge Drum\n     4> Leak from the Thermosyphon Vessels\n     5> Leak from the High Pressure Liquid Lines\n\nAlternative scenarios #1 (Condensing Towers), #4 (Thermosyphon Vessels) and #5 (High Pressure Liquid Lines) operate at similar pressures, 195 psig, and therefore have similar release rates of 2,226 pounds per minute.  Based on a 10-minute response time, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.3 miles, affecting a population of approximately 17.\n\nAlternative scenarios #2 (8.7 Receiver) and #3 (Brine Chiller Surge Drum) operate at similar pressures, 4.273 psig, and therefore have similar release rates of 329.6 pounds per minute.  Based on a 20-minute reponse time, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles, affecting a population of approximately two.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Washington facility has been operated by Perdue Farms since 1984 and has not had a serious accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, associate injuries and property or environmental damage.\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPOSNSE PROGRAM:\nIn the event of an emergency involving our refrigeration system, Perdue's Washington facility has a well defined incident command system.  The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials.  Perdue continues to train its associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and rou"

The goals of the plan are to:\n\n     1> Educate the public on the potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue;\n     2> Respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communications;\n     3> Be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental release scenario.\n\nProactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, how the community should respond; and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared.  In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civic groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nAs part of Perdue's continual improvement philosophy, all Perdue facilities continue to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety."
