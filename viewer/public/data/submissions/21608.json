      "SummaryText": " with the potential for causing property damage, material loss, or interruption of our business; waste; and releases to the environment.\n\nWe will emphasize product stewardship and advocate its importance to our suppliers, distributors, and customers.\n\n\nFacility Description:\nThe primary activity at the Parlin Plant is the manufacture of Natrosol? (hydroxyethyl cellulose). Natrosol ?  is used  as a thickener in latex paint and personal care products. The primary ingredients in Natrosol ? are cellulose (wood or cotton linter fiber) and ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is received in 25,000-gallon railroad tank cars and stored in two tanks, each limited to 27,000 gallons by administrative controls. The ethylene oxide unloading and storage area is provided with containment dikes and pits in which a spill can be diluted with water. This facility is also equipped with leak detectors and fixed water spray nozzles to minimize any adverse impacts if there were a spill.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario for the plant is the failure of an entire storage tank, containing 27,000 gallons (195,000 pounds) of ethylene oxide. This scenario will have an offsite impact, based on the use of the SLAB model . This scenario is based on the EPA required assumption for toxic gases that the tank contents will flash to vapor in 10 minutes. Because the boiling point of ethylene oxide is close to ambient conditions, the material will not completely vaporize in 10 minutes, instead, a liquid pool will form and the ethylene oxide will evaporate, as well as flash. When this, more realistic scenario is modeled, the offsite impact is reduced significantly. In addition, this scenario requires the extremely unlikely event of a catastrophic failure of the storage tank. Administrative controls in standard operating procedure and high level alarms limit the quantity released in this scenario.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario: \nThe alternative case scenario for ethylene oxide is a discharge of 3,900 p"

      "SummaryText": "ounds of vapor from a relief valve that fails to close. This scenario will have an offsite impact, based on the use of the EPA OCAG guidance. The impact from this scenario is limited by the design, which incorporates a multi-port valve that can be re-positioned to isolate the failed valve and place another in service. \n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe use of ethylene oxide in the plant's processes has been subject the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) regulations since their adoption in 1988, as well as the subsequently adopted OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119).  The plant has an established risk management system in place to meet these requirements and to minimize the potential for accidental release of these substances. Our management system includes:\n1. Process hazard analysis to identify and address potential hazards.\n2. Management of change procedures to assure that standards are maintained and potential new hazards assessed. \n3. Mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, Detailed operating procedures for process control \n4. Training for the personnel involved in operating and maintaining the processes.\n5. Facility design incorporates multiple layers of incident prevention.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIn the past five years, the Parlin plant has not had any accidental releases of ethylene oxide that resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Parlin plant has a written emergency response plan and coordinates emergency response matters with the Sayreville Office of Emergency Management (L.E.P.C.). The plant provides emergency response training for all plant employees and has trained emergency response teams on site. Emergency response exercises are conducted several times each year."
