Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\r\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\r\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\r\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Delta Producers Coop in Delta, Colorado are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\r\nresponse efforts with the Delta Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in two 12,000-gallon tanks, one 18,000-gallon tank, thirty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks\r\nand ten 500-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Delta, Colorado (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\r\nstored is 77,000 gallons ( 336,805.7 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The\r\nlargest single storage vessel at our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum\r\nstorage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (78,733.8 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\r\nperiod.
