      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nIt is the Policy of Tempur Production USA, Inc. to prevent accidental release of chemicals by managing the receiving, the storage and transfer of chemicals in a manner that minimizes the risk of accidental release.  Tempur Production USA, Inc. Emergency  Response Policy has been developed to protect Human Health and the Environment in the event of an accidental chemical release.\n\n\n2.0 Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nTempur Production USA, Inc. is a newly constructed Polyurethane Foam Manufacturing facility located at 4700 Boone Trail Road South, Duffield Virginia, 24244.   The facility will begin the production of foam products during the second quarter of 2001.  The facility has recognized the need to comply with 40 CFR Part 68, EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\nThe Tempur Production USA facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed based upon the List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention.  Those chemical(s) exceeding the Threshold Quantities include:\n\nProcess 1) Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) (unspecified isomer) \nCAS # 26471-62-1  (Threshold Planning Quantity = 10,000 pounds)\n\nTDI at the Duffield facility will be offloaded, stored, and utilized within the 300,000 SF manufacturing site.  Vessel storage of TDI will consist of 6 tanks with each tank having a capacity of 6,600 gallons (67,000 pounds) with a total aggregate storage capacity of 402,000 pounds contained within a increased fire rated structure located within the primary facility.  The TDI storage area is encompassed by a secondary containment structure capable of capturing releases in excess of the capacity of the largest vessel.  The secondary containment structure is encompassed by tertiary containment area capable of capturing the capacity of all of the TDI within the largest vessel.   The enclosed off loading bay is immediately adjacent"

No external heat is added during the process and the TDI is stable at the ambient temperature ranges.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan identifies one (1) regulated process with the potential for toxic liquid release.  No processes have been identified that involve materials from the list of Regulated Flammable Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.0 Worst Case Scenario\nBased upon the worst case scenario of a catastrophic vessel failure that resulted in an instantaneous release of 100% of the largest tank contents into the secondary containment:\n\nSecondary Containment area      130 square meters\nLiquid Temperature                      77 degrees F\nRelease rate to outside air           0.0118 pounds per minute\nTotal evaporation time                  6370000 minutes\nTopography                                 Rural Surroundings\n(note: RMP*Submit electronic filing software did not permit entering a release rate to outside air of less than 1 pound per minute nor a total evaporation time of greater than 60 minutes)\n\nThe estimated distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles was calculated by RMP*Comp Version 1.04 based upon a toxic endpoint value of 0.0070 mg/l in air.  Based upon the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles in this rural community, the facility has recognized there to be public receptors along the fringe boundary of the endpoint radius.  Given the close proximity to the endpoint distance of these public receptors, the facility has elected to file the RMP within the Program 2 protocol.  While it is highly unlikely the worst-case scenario would occur, it is even more unlikely for impact to occur to these public receptors.  The public receptors along the fringe boundary of the endpoint distance radius include small commercial businesses in the immediate vicinity"

These include:\n\n\u00b7\tThe compiling and maintaining of up-to-date Safety Information.\n\u00b7\tThe completion of a Hazard Review.\n\u00b7\tThe development and implementation of appropriate operating procedures.\n\u00b7\tAdequate training of process employees."

However, this facility is comparable to facilities operated outside the USA by the same parent company.  No off-site accidents have occurred at those facilities within the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n7.0 Emergency Response Program\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been developed and will be maintained for the facility.
