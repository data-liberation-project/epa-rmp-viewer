The Fort Knox Mine is located in the Fairbanks North Star Borough, approximately 26-road miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska.  The site may be reached by driving north from Fairbanks approximately ten miles via the Steese Highway to Fox and northeast on Alaska Highway 2 for approximately eight and a half miles to the Twin Creeks exit.  At approximately three miles, the unpaved Twin Creeks road splits and a large sign directs traffic to the left.  Three miles further, the road ends at the Fort Knox Mine entrance.\n\nThe Fort Knox Mine utilizes open pit mining techniques to extract mineralized ore for subsequent processing.  The ore is crushed and conveyed to a stockpile that provides surge capacity for the crusher and milling operations.  The crushed ore is fed to the grinding circuit and processed using conventional milling and Cyanide in Leach technology.  Carbon removes gold from the tailing stream for refining and the tailing are detoxified prior to deposition in the tailing impoundment.  The carbon is stripped and the gold recovered on stainless steel cathodes within electrowinning cells.  Sludge from the electrowinning cells is ref"

Carbon stripped of gold in the refining process is washed in Hydrochloric Acid to regenerate the carbon by removing organic material and scale prior to introducing the carbon back into the recovery process.   The Hydrochloric Acid is stored within secondary containment in the refinery building in a tank that has a total capacity of 10,152 gallons.\n\nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), as determined by 30 CFR, has jurisdiction at the site in lieu of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  Safety inspections and reporting are completed by and to MSHA.\n\nFGMI strives to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances by providing training to all newly hired employees and annual refresher training to all employees. All employees are trained on the Standard for Hazard Communication procedure, including how to locate, read and understand a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).  All employees are trained by their supervisor on the chemicals and products in their work areas that contain hazardous materials.  \n\n1.    The supervisor shows the employee the locations of hazardous materials, explaining how to read warning labels, and identifying the locations of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  \n2.    The supervisor reviews with the employees the appropriate MSDS sheets and during routine safety meetings or special training sessions review safety and health protective measures needed for the hazardous materials.\n\nThe Fort Knox Mine began construction in March 1995 and operations commenced in the fourth quarter of 1996.

This plan also includes procedures for supporting responses to incidents that occur offsite involving hazardous materials being shipped to the Fort Knox Mine.  Implementation of this plan is intended to mitigate or protect Fort Knox personnel and the surrounding community from: \n1.    Injury. \n2.    Prevent contamination of waters of the United States with hazardous materials. \n3.    Prevent damage to the environment. \n4.    Provide fire fighting procedures \n5.
