The OxyChem New Johnsonville facility anticipates operations to begin in Q1, 2014 with 72 employees, producing chlorine, caustic soda, and hydrogen.  This initial Risk Management Plan is being submitted prior to initial plant start-up as allowed by EPA RMP section 1.16, Predictive Filing.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the New Johnsonville facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  Part of this commitment includes the establishment of systems for the safe operation of processes to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and the development of emergency response policies to respond to emergency situations which at a minimum are consistent with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  \n\n\n\n* The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (? 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem New Johnsonville facility consists of a single chemical production unit that is wholly owned and operated by OxyChem.  The facility conducted a threshold determination consistent with 40 CFR 68.115 and has identified one substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP): Chlorine (CAS Number 7782-50-5).\n\n\n\n* The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem New Johnsonville facility's prevention program has been prepared to be consistent with OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The site's prevention program is documented, routinely reviewed, updated as necessary, and addresses several elements including:\n\n\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Man"

All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and periodic in-plant drills are conducted.  The drills are used to gauge the response time of the Emergency Response Team, the accuracy of the plant employee accountability program, and the mobilization of the plant's Emergency Operations Center.  In addition, the OxyChem New Johnsonville facility has developed a Special Situations Plan for responding to emergencies which may impact areas beyond the immediate plant boundaries.  This plan is a supplement of and complement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a member of the Humphreys County Local Emergency Planning Committee (\"LEPC\"), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\n\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(g))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem New Johnsonville facility continually works to improve safety through annual reviews of our plant process safety information, investigations of near misses and incidents, and engagement of all site employees on matters of safety and environmental compliance.\n\n"
