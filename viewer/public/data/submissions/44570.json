We use a combination of resources including personnel training, consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the different refinery processes.  We have accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n1] A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n2]  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n3] An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n4] A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n5] An overview of our emergency response program\n\n6] An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n7] The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n8] The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n \n\n \n\n FACILITY DESCRIPTION, STATIONARY SOURCE, AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n \n\n Shell Chemical Yabucoa Inc. Refinery produces and distributes petroleum fuels and distillate products from  Crude Oil feedstocks.

The Refinery  has an Environmental Quality Board CAA Permit #PFE-TV-2911-0397-0025.\n\n \n\n The Refinery uses the following flammable chemical that has been identified as regulated under the EPA's RMP rule with the potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of an accidental release:\n\n \n\n Propane - Used for fuel purposes in the Hydrogen Process Units.  It is also used as fuel in the Utilities Unit especially during start up and shutdown operations.  We have two propane storage bullets, one located at the MEK Unit Area, which contains 121,000 Lbs. (full capacity) and the other propane storage bullet located at the Utilities Area, which contains 142,000 Lbs. (full capacity).\n\n \n\n No regulated toxic material is handled or stored in quantities above the threshold limit values established for reporting by the regulation.\n\n \n\n \n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT PROGRAM\n\n \n\n The hazard assessment program of EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.   The EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guideline was used for the calculation of the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) results. It is important to understand that this scenario is based on the regulatory guidelines and it is calculated using the EPA rules.  The worst-case scenario associated with a release of a flammable substance in Program 3 processes at the Refinery, a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), follows:\n\n \n\n \n\n Worst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n \n\n A catastrophic rupture of the second largest propane vessel of the refinery occurs releasing the total content (121,000 Lbs.) of the flammable substance.

Results of these studies are documented, and records of implementation and follow up are maintained.  \n\n \n\n Operating Procedures\n\n \n\n Shell Chemical Yabucoa Inc.

Refinery has established policies and practices committing it to providing a safe workplace for its employees and to protecting the environment in its areas of operation. The primary goal of the Mechanical Integrity Program is to assure that all equipment and systems used to handle or process highly hazardous chemicals are designed, built, installed and maintained to control the risk of releases and other accidents.  The program outlines the commitments of the Refinery to ensure that its workplaces are safe.  This is done by defining the organization and controls, and the guidelines and procedures to be used by all personnel to protect the employees and the facilities.  The program is intended to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of a release of toxic or hazardous chemicals.  The refinery will continue to design, maintain, and operate its facilities, equipment and resources in a cost-effective manner, which recognizes that compliance with safety and environmental regulations is paramount.

The purpose of the pre-start up safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all support systems are operationally ready.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n \n\n Compliance Audits\n\n \n\n Corporate compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  This ensures that the Process Safety Program is being maintained as required.  This is accomplished by conducting a formal evaluation and certification.
