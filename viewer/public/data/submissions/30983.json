      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n \nRinchem Company, Inc. (Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures.  Its commitment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n \n      \"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our       communities and the environment.\"\n \nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.  \n \nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n \nRinchem's Hillsboro Chemical Warehouse at 4605 NW 235th stores chemicals for industry.  There is only one substance regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 ? ammonium (ammonium hydroxide) - that is stored above the threshold quantity at this facility.  The ammonium hydroxide is not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of containers.   \n \nRinchem is located in an industrial setting with residential neighbors no closer than 0.5 miles away.  The Hillsboro warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials.  There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a liquid release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as full containment of all storage/staging areas and sloped loading docks.  The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) use of engineering and administrative controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n \nThe areas of compliance include:\n \n- having an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan for flammables stored at the facility \n \n     - having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n \n     - only accepting materia"

It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians or an approved contractor. \n                                                                       Training is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most accidents.  The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for all new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \nThere has never been a reportable accident involving ammonium hydroxide at this facility.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n \nRinchem has a comprehensive emergency response plan.  The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public.  The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan.  Facility orientation classes are held where evacuation plans and procedures are reviewed.  Facility-wide drills are also performed on a quarterly basis.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our facilities.  Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventive measures are adequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe.  However, we are committed to continue to use o"
