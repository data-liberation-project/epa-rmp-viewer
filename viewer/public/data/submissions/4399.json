              "Description": "CSM Industries\nRisk Management Program for HF Acid \nProgram 3 Prevention Program\n Regulated Material (HF) Hazards:\n1) Process Equipment:\nA) Materials of construction:\nI) Bath: The outer shell is carbon steel with an epoxy lining.  The lower     half of the bath is lined with a non-silica containing, heat resistant brick.  \nII) Piping, valves, and pumps:  Are constructed of PVC.  All seals and gaskets are Teflon or silicone.\nIII) Tanks\na) HF Storage Tank:  Outer shell is carbon steel, lined with  PVC .\nb) Neutralizer Tank:  Fiberglass reinforced plastic tank\nc) Clean HF Acid Tank:  PVC tank\nIV) Diked Areas/Enclosed Areas:\na) Floors: Coated with a four layer acid resistant epoxy.\nb) Walls: Plexiglas panels or acid resistant treated brick (up 2 bricks high).\nB) Piping and instrument Diagrams:  All of the HF piping is constructed of double walled PVC piping.  All valves are composed of PVC with Teflon seals.  \nC) Electrical Classification: Corrosive\nD) Relief System Design:  The HF bath and containment area are drained to a \ntank in the basement.  It this tank were to be over filled, the spill would be \ncontained inside of the neutralization room.  The floor and side wall blocking \nhave been coated with an acid resistant coating.  This coating has four layers.  A base coat, a fiberglass layer, a bisphenol layer and a finishing coat.  This system is designed to withstand the heat generated from the reaction of acid with water (from deluge system).  The containment of the neutralization room is approximately 4050 cubic feet.      \nE) Ventilation System Design:  \nI) Bath:  The ventilation system is a continuos, low velocity system.  It \ndraws from on point inside the \"dip\" section of the bath.  The 12\" duct \ncarries the fumes to the scrubber located on the roof.  The draw is \napproximately 2800 cfm from this bath. \nII) Neutralization Room: This room is vented by a continuos, low velocity    \nsystem.  The fumes from this area are carried to a roof top scrubber.  \nF) Safety Systems:\nI) Deluge System:  The deluge system is designed to flood the diked                containment area behind conditioning and the neutralization area in the   event of a catastrophic spill or event.  This system is activated by opening the deluge valve in the basement on the west wall near the north in take fans or pulling the valve open by the cooling tower.  The water will be collected in the neutralization sump and pumped to the neutralization tank.  \n2) Process Hazard Analysis:\nA) Process Incident History :   No spills in the last five years. \nB) Engineering  and Administrative Controls:\nI) Administrative Controls:\nThe plant is manned every day of the year by a Stationary Engineer.  \nPart of  their job responsibilities is the inspection of the neutralization area.  This area is to be checked every hour. \nII) Engineering Controls:  \na) Dip Tank:\nAn over flow drain has been installed to prevent the tank from being over filled.  The line drains down to the neutralizer sump. \nb) HF Storage Tank:\nAn overflow line has been installed to prevent this tank from being over filled.  The line drains to the neutralization tank.                                              C) Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls:\nI) Administrative Controls:\nIf a Stationary Engineer fails to complete his inspection round(s), a spill \nof  several thousand gallons could result from a tank failure or a spill of       \n50 to several hundred gallons could result from line(s) failure.  The spill \nitself should be contained by the neutralization walls.  Spills of this size would result in the neutralization area becoming filled with acid fumes.  The ventilation system should be capable of handling most of  these fumes.  However, some of the fumes would escape out of the doors and above the Plexiglas enclosures.  These fumes would be diluted by the incoming plant air and spread throughout the plant.  The resulting spill would have to be  neutralized and cleaned up.  If the ventilation system failed during such an incident, the fumes would fill the basement and be spread throughout the plant.  This would lead to loss of production time and product.     \nII) Engineering Controls:\na) Dip Tank Over Flow:\nFailure of this overflow would result in a spill being generated upstairs under the tank.  However, the area under the tank would drain down to the neutralizer sum where it would be contained and neutralized.  \nb) HF Storage Tank Over Flow:\nFailure of this overflow would result in a spill being generated in the neutralization area.  The spill would be contained by the walls.  The spill could be neutralized and cleaned up inside of the room.  Fumes from the spill should be treated by the ventilation system.\nE) Human Factors:  During first shift week days, the pipe fitters are on shift and will respond to mechanical failures on the HF system.  However, on the off shifts and weekends, the Stationary Engineers are responsible to check and maintain this system.  No spill should ever go more than an hour undetected.\nEquipment operators should always inspect all equipment before they use it.  If pipelines or hose lines are discovered to be damaged or appear worn, they should not be used.  Their condition should be reported to the maintenance supervisor.  Tank levels should always be inspected prior to dropping spent acid from the bath to the basement. The main drain line valves from the dipping tank is  manually operated.  The operator(s) must make sure that the valve is closed prior to filling the dip tank.    \n                                                                                                                             CSM Industries \nRisk Management Program for Nitric Acid and Sulfuric Acid \nProgram 3 Prevention Program\nRegulated Material Mixed Acid( 70% Oleum and 30% Nitric Acid):\n1) Process Equipment:\nA) Materials of construction:\nI) Bath: The outer shell is carbon steel with an epoxy lining.  The lower half of the bath is lined with a non-silica containing, heat resistant brick.                                                                                                                    II) Piping, valves, and pumps: The 2-inch line is made of carbon steel.  \nThe = inch line is made of PVC.  All seals and gaskets are Teflon or silicone.\nIII) Tanks\na) Mixed Acid Storage Tank:  The outer shell is Stainless steel.\nb) Neutralizer Tank:  Stainless Steel.\nc) Mixed Acid Tank in Basement:  Stainless\nd) Rinse Water tank: Fiberglass reinforced plastic.\nIV) Diked Areas/Enclosed Areas:\na) Floors: Coated with a four layer acid resistant epoxy.\nb) Walls: Plexiglas panels or acid resistant treated brick (up 2 bricks high).\nc) Dike For Outside Storage Tank: Coated with a four layer acid resistant coating.                                                                                                                  2) Piping and instrument Diagrams:  All of the mixed acid lines are either stainless or PVC in composition. All valves are composed of PVC with Teflon seals.  \na) Electrical Classification: Corrosive \nb) Relief System Design: The mixed acid bath and containment areas are drained to a tank in the basement.  If this tank were to be over filled, the spill would be contained inside of the neutralization room.  The floor and side wall blocking have been coated with an acid resistant coating.  This coating has four layers.  A base coat, a fiberglass layer, a bisphenol layer and a finishing coat.  This system is designed to withstand the heat generated from the reaction of acid with water (from deluge system).  The containment of the neutralization room is approximately 4050 cubic feet.      \nc) Ventilation System Design:  \nI) Bath:  The ventilation system is a continuos, low velocity system.  It \ndraws from a point inside the \"dip\" section of the bath.  The 12\" duct \ncarries the fumes to the scrubber located on the roof.  The draw is approximately 2800 cfm from this bath. \nII) Neutralization Room: This room is vented by a continuos, low velocity \nventilation system.  All fumes are vented to the roof top scrubbers.     \nd) Safety Systems:\nI) Deluge System:  The deluge system is designed to flood the diked               containment area behind conditioning and the neutralization area in the   event of a catastrophic spill or event.  This system is activated by opening the deluge valve in the basement on the west wall near the north in take fans or pulling the valve open by the cooling tower.  The water will be collected in the neutralization sump and pumped to the neutralization tank.  \n3)  Process Incident History :  No reportable spills have occurred in the last five years. \n4) Engineering  and Administrative Controls:\nI) Administrative Controls:\nThe plant is manned every day of the year  by a Stationary Engineer.  \nPart of  their job responsibilities is the inspection of the neutralization area.  This area is to be checked every hour. \nII) Engineering Controls:  \na) Dip Tank:\nAn over flow drain has been installed to prevent the tank from being over filled.

The line drains to the neutralization tank. \n5) Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls:\nI) Administrative Controls:\nIf a Stationary Engineer fails to complete his inspection round(s), a spill \nof  several thousand gallons could result from a tank failure or a spill of       \n50 to several hundred gallons could result from line(s) failure.  If the \nspill  occurred in the basement tank,  it should be contained by the \nneutralization walls.  Spills of  this size would result in the neutralization area becomes filled with acid fumes.  The ventilation system should be capable of handling  most of  these fumes.  However, some of the fumes would escape out of the doors and above the Plexiglas enclosures.  These fumes would be diluted by the incoming plant air and spread throughout the plant.  The resulting spill would have to be  neutralized and cleaned up.  If the ventilation  system failed during such an incident, the fumes would fill the basement and be spread throughout the plant.  This would lead to loss of production time and product.  If the spill occurred to the outside storage tank, the surrounding containment dike is sized to contain the entire contents of the tank.  The dike has been lined with an acid resistant coating.  The fiberglass in the coating is designed to prevent thermal expansion from causing the containment dike from cracking.   The contained material would be pumped into a tanker and properly disposed . \nII) Engineering Controls:\na) Dip Tank Over Flow:\nFailure of this overflow would result in a spill being generated upstairs under the tank.  However, the area under the tank drains down to the neutralizer sum where it would be contained and neutralized.  \nb) Mixed Acid Storage Tank (in the basement) Over Flow:\nFailure of this overflow would result in a spill being generated in the neutralization area.  The spill would be contained by the walls.  The spill could be neutralized and cleaned up inside of the room.  Fumes from the spill should be treated by the ventilation system.\nc) Mixed Acid Storage Tank (outside) Containment Dike:\nFailure of this structure would result in the acid spilling out into the surround grassy area.\n6) Human Factors:  During first shift week days, the pipe fitters are on shift and will respond to mechanical failures of the mixed acid system.  However, on the off shifts and weekends, the Stationary Engineers are responsible to check and maintain this system.  No spill should ever go more than an hour undetected.\nEquipment operators should always inspect all equipment before they use it.  If pipelines or hose lines are discovered to be damaged or appear worn, they should not be used.  There condition should be reported to the maintenance supervisor.  Tank levels should always be inspected prior to dropping spent acid from the bath to the basement. The main drain line valves from the dipping tank is  manually operated.

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nIn this facility, we roll molybdenum and tungsten sheet and foil products.  As part of operation, we use hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid in the cleaning operations.  Hydrofluoric acid is considered to be an extremely hazardous substance by the EPA.  The EPA classifies nitric and sulfuric acids as toxic chemicals.  The nature of hydrofluoric, nitric, and sulfuric acids make it necessary to observe certain precautions in their handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure in the facility and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, and the safety training and procedures that we use.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on a worst-case scenario and assumes the spill being contained with in the building. This plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. \nThe primary product of this facility is rolled molybdenum and tungsten sheet and foil products.  Hydrofluoric acid is used in our pickling line to help remove surface contaminates.  Hydrofluoric acid is stored on site in two concentrations.  A high (70%) grade of acid is maintained in drums in side the facility in a diked area.  No more than two drums are on site at any one time.  The hydrofluoric acid bath contains a 1150-gallon mixture of hydrofluoric acid (11%), nitric acid (21%), and water.  This lower (11%) grade is also intermittently stored in the basement in small quantities until it is nuetralized.  The regulated substances handled at this facility are hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric Acid.    \n\nThe maximum amount of hydrofluoric acid that can"

The maximum amount of nitric acid that can be stored on site is 28,000 pounds of the 80% pure acid.  The maximum amount of sulfuric acid that can be stored on site is 47,000 pounds of the 20% pure acid.    \n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\nWorst-Case Scenario: Failure of HF pickling tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 1100 gallons of a 11% HF mixture.  The resulting spill would be contained by the diked neutralization room in the basement.  This room has a low velocity ventilation system.  The vented air is sent to scrubber systems on the roof.  The scrubber is rated to be 95% efficient.  A deluge system is available if needed.  If the ventilation unit failed, the distance to the end point for the worst case scenario is 0.20 miles.  If the scrubber unit were operating, the distance to endpoint would be less than 0.1 miles.  This assumes that the temperature is 77degrees F.    \n                                                                                                                                                                  Alternative Scenario: During a drum delivery, a drum falls of the dock and ruptures leaking 25 gallons of 70% HF acid onto the drive way.  The area would be diked off and drains covered to prevent the material from leaving the property line.  The material would be neutralized, clean up and disposed in accordance with Federal and State regulations.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.10 miles.  This assumes a release rate of 2.3 pounds per minute [QR=QS (246) x2.4XLFA (0.01) XDF (0.39)] and a spill duration of 107 minutes.

The tank is completely filled and results in 5700 gallons of a 70/30 mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid is released.  3990 gallons of a 20% oleum or sulfuric acid being released.  1710 gallons of an 80% nitric acid is released.  The spill is contained by a 6000-gallon containment dike.  This structure is 14' x 24' or 336 sq. ft of surface area and 3 feet deep.  The resulting spill has an estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles.            \n  \nThe population of people that would be affected would vary greatly depending on the time of the incident.  The 1996 US Census estimated that 52,472 people live in Euclid.  The US Census \"Tiger\" Mapping Service classifies the area surrounding CSM Industries as having a population of 0.1- 24570 people per square mile.  Assuming a worst case scenario of 24570 people per square mile, the 0.2 mile radius incident could affect around 3000 people and the 0.1 mile radius incident could affect 1500 people.  These numbers were calculated assuming that 60% of the population would be home or in the area at the time of the incident.  For Example, the 3000 affected population=(24570people x.2 mile radius x.6 (60 %) =_2948 people).  These estimates seem high when considering the location of the plant.  The 0.2 radius surrounding the plant is primarily industrial and railroad property. Much of the surrounding property inside of the 0.2-mile radius is used by the railroads and is not inhabited.  When these factors are considered, an affected population numbers of 1500 for the 0.2-mile incident and 750 for the 0.1-mile incident are still conservative numbers.  If the incident were to occur during an evening and/or weekend, these numbers would be significantly lower.  \n                                                    "

Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention: CSM Industries relies on several policies, procedures, and process control systems to prevent an accidental release from occurring at our facility.  All transfers of liquids are completed within containment walls or diked areas with an employee present.  The surfaces of these areas have been lined with an acid resistant epoxy resin system.  Under the top coat of resin, there is a layer of figerglass that is designed to prevent thermal stress from fracturing the structure.  All process holding tanks are located in secondary containment areas and have overflow/secondary reserviors.  Once again, these containment areas are lined with an acid resistant coating.  The secondary reserviors are sized to hold the entire contents of the main process holding tank(s) in the case of a process failure.  As part of our preventative maintenance program, every shutdown the piping and valving are given a visual/operational inspection.  If problems are noted, the are fixed immediatley.  CSM Industries conducts yearly training on its ERP program elements.  This training is given to all of the process employees who handle regulated materials and includes spill policies and procedures.  The final preventative measure that CSM has implemented is an around the clock staffing of the facility.  Our plant is occupied 24 hours a day, seven days a week, ever day of the year by a Stationary Engineer.  Part of their job duties is an hourly visual inspection of the process equipment.                                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History: No reportable spills have occurred at this facility.                                                                                    "

The plant is equipped with a manual pull station fire alarm system that has a direct link to a monitoring company.  Pull stations are located at every exit and audio/visual strobe lights are strategically located throughout the plant.  In the event of an emergency, if the alarm system is sounded, the monitoring company will call the Euclid Fire Department.  The plant is occupied 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a Stationary Engineer.  Part of their normal hourly duties include plant inspections of the process equipment.  CSM's Emergency Response Plan details the course of action that shall be taken in the event of a spill.  This plan includes a list of privately operated Hazmat facilities and Government Agencies which may need to be contacted in the event of an emergency.  CSM Indusries mailed a copy of its most recently reviewed ERP to the Euclid Fire Department on May 12, 1999.  The emergency response plan also includes a section on first aid and possible health effects for the toxic and hazardous materials in the plant.  MSDS sheets are also included in this document.  CSM Industries conducts yearly training on the different components of the ERP and conducts a yearly fire drill.                                                                                                                                                                      7.Planned Changes to improve Safety:During the Risk Management assessment process several areas in the process were noted that could be improved.  CSM Industries intends to add additional ventilation to the neutralization area.  A Colag scrubber unit will be added to this area to prevent fumes from an accidental release from escaping to the basement air.  Air monitoring equipment will be purchased and installed in this area to monitor the air borne a"
