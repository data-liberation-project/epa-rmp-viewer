Paw Paw, Michigan (CCR) is used for the packaging of fruit juice and juice-based drink products.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's closed-loop refrigeration systems.  The system provides process and warehouse cooling for raw materials and the chilled juice packaging operation.  The refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia for RMP.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nCCR is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent in our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. In addition to complying with the RMP Rule, the facility also complies with OSHA's  29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM ) Standard.  The PSM program serves as the RMP Prevention Plan, and includes the required prevention elements such as written operating procedures, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigations, and compliance audits.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. Such controls include ammonia detectors with alarms and interlocks, safety relief valves, level indicators, high-pressure shutdowns, and other safety instrumented systems.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, CCR has coordinated with the Paw Paw Fire Department and the Van Buren County LEPC for emergency response support.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe CCR facility at Paw Paw has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in an offsite consequence in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe CCR wri"

      "SummaryText": "tten Emergency Action Plan (EAP) focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency and complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The Plan documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases.  Containment and mitigation of a release will be accomplished by qualified, offsite contract personnel. Local emergency response agencies will perform rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment and other response functions only after a release has been stopped and it is safe to enter the premises. The plan is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that require modified procedures. The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the Van Buren County LEPC. The Paw Paw Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all general facility emergencies. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety in the future include addressing recent audit and PHA findings in a timely manner and sharing of best practices with other CCR facilities.\n\n"
