This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Kiva Energy, LP Terminal LLC to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Reno Propane terminal located in Washoe County, Nevada is owned by Kiva Energy, LP Terminal, LLC and its partners.\r\n\r\nThe Reno Propane terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility.  The facility receives odorized propane LPG by rail car and stores the liquid in one of three above ground pressurized storage tanks.   A propane vapor compressor is used to provide pressurized vapors into the vapor space for the unloading of rail cars spotted on the facility rail siding.  The same compressor is subsequently used to remove vapors from the empty cars prior to their disconnection from the tank fill piping and railcar unloading racks.  Odorized propane stored in the three above-ground propane storage bullets is transferred to 18-wheel or smaller bobtail propane delivery trucks through the use of a small liquid propane pump.  The terminal operator is responsible for the hookup, unloading and disconnection of supply rail cars.  The operator also assists with the proper loading of transport trucks that fill up at the terminal, and with coordinating the removal of empty rail cars and the delivery of full cars as the propane transfer demand requires.\r\n\r\nThe Reno Propane Terminal facility wa"

Kiva Energy identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on the known volumes of the storage tanks and supply rail cars.  The only listed flammable substance which is stored above the threshold quantity at the Reno Propane Terminal facility is odorized propane.  The propane terminal facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program.  \r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nNo toxic materials to report.\r\n\r\n Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Reno LPG Terminal.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nKiva Energy strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, and hazard communications. \r\n\r\nKiva Energy actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments o"

These documents address chemical properties.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nKiva Energy also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nKiva Energy primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The plant operator and operations management identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Reno LPG Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Reno LPG Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process."

All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Reno LPG Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Reno LPG Terminal conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Reno LPG Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies.
