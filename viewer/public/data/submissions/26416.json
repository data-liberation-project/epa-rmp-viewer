      "SummaryText": "1.0 Introduction: A Risk Managment Plan has been implemented at Franzia Ripon for the reduction of the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.\n\n2.0  Franzia  Ripon Policies to Protect Health, Emvironment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Franzia Ripon.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Franzia Ripon is committed to conduting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to human health, the environment, and safety starts with upper managment.  All Managers and Supervisors are members of the Safety and Health Committee and dedicate time each month to review health and safety matters.  The employees at Franzia Ripon attend health and safety meetings led by their supervisors or managers.  Each manager and supervisor reports their discussions with their employees each month at the Safety and Health Committee meetings.  The Committee reviews safety performances, takes corrective action when appropriate, and strives for continuous improvement.  Franzia's commitment to safety is demonstrated in the training programs for all employees, including seasonal employees.  The training programs provide information on preventing accidents through knowledge of hazards and safe work practices.\n\n3.0 Facility Identification\n\nThe Franzia Ripon facility is located at 17000 East Highway 120, Ripon, California.  The facility produces grape juice, wine, and distilled spirits.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration and sulfur dioxide for bacterial control and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule.  Three ammonia refrigeration systems, not interconnected, are regulated under the RMP rule: Chiller Group A, Group B, and Group C, containin"

The three ammonia systems are considered a single process totaling 99,000 pounds.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is located at three different filling stations throughout the winery.  There are 2,000 lbs at two of the stations, and 14,000 lbs at the third station.  The three fillings stations are considered a single process totaling 18,000 pounds.\n\n4.0 Hazard Assessment-Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of the 84' by 30' anhydrous ammonia tank, located  in Chiller Group B.  The ammonia is maintained as a liquid via pressurization and is limited by an 85% engineering control.  A catastrohic failure  would result in 40,000 lbs of ammonia being released over a ten-minute period.\n\nHazard assessment modeling shows that, under the worst-case weather conditions and a 10-minute release period, the release could travel downwind and affect public receptors before reaching  the toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm).\n\n5.0 Hazard Assessment-Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nAn ARS was modeled for the ammonia and sulfur dioxide substances in the hazard assessment.  The ARS fo ammonia assumes a release of ammonia from a 1/4-inch hole in a condenser drain line that has ruptured due to double blockage.  No public receptors are affected by this scenario; the distance that this release travels before dissipating to the toxic endpoint is less than the distance to any pubic receptors.\n\nThe ARS for sulfur dioxide assumes a 1/4-inch hole devloping in a hose line.  The release is assumed to occur when an employee is transferring the sulfur dioxide in to a smaller cylinder.  The release is estimated to travel offsite until the toxic endopoint of 3 ppm is reached.  Small numbers of public receptors may be affected in this scenario.  \n\n6.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in "

      "SummaryText": "accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle sulfur dioxide and ammonia above the threshold quantity fo either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n-Process safety information is provided to all employees upon hire and is accessible at all times,\n-In-depth process hazard anlyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard,\n-Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work operation,\n-Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request,\n-Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the pesent hazards, and informed of any temproarysituations affecting safety,\n-Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n-A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation,\n-A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly,\n-A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely,\n-Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort,\n-Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe work practices are followed.\n\n7.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\nSince January 1994 to the present, there have been no accidents or releases of regulated sybstances from covered processes that qualify for rep"

      "SummaryText": "orting according to the EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Such \"RMP Accidents\" would include serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage,  or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  Franzia Ripon realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria.  The company has been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous mateirals and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\n8.0 Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe federal RMP and Cal ARP regulations grant exemptions for the emergency response plan requirements for facilities that do not conduct their own emergency response.  The exemption is valid provided that the facility is included in the community emergency repsonse plan and that there is an appropriate mechanism in place to notify emergency repsonders when necessary.  Franzia Ripon satisfies these requirements.  A Business Plan has been submitted to San Joaquin County, which contains the required elements discussed above. Emergency response has been coordinated with the local Fire Deaprtment.\n\n9.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Health and Safety Committee has minimized chemical exposure risks to employees and the public through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts.  For example, as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis, barriers were installed around the ammonia processes and detailed procedures wre documented.  Other improvements will be made when identified and approved by Management."
