(Sinomax) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs will be fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \r\n\r\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe Sinomax facility produces polyurethane foam for mattresses and sleep products and is located at 1740 J.P. Hennessy Drive in Verona, MS.  Polyurethane foam is a product made by combining chemicals (i.e., isocyanates, polyols, and additives) that undergo a chemical reaction as they are injected into a mold cavity. One such chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the polyurethane foam manufacturing process. TDI is stored in three (3) 20,000-gallon TDI Bulk Storage Tanks and the facility has the capability to have up to four (4) rail cars on-site with capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons each. After reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Sinomax completed a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The last PHA was conducted on December 7, 2021, using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI process. This process safety info"

The PHA was conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67 (i.e., what-if), and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the TDI process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used . A system has been established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Sinomax has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where TDI is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. These operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI process. These operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and changes to the facility.

This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.71. Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. Sinomax documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: Sinomax has written documents and programs to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the TDI process (i.e., storage tanks, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed. Each person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the TDI process components receives training at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Sinomax has established written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures and changes that affect the TDI process. These procedures assure that appropriate considerations are addressed prior to any change. Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process or affected part of the process.
