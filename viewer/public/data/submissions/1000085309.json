The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release to minimize the potential impact to VCP's employees, the public, and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Peoria Fire Department.\r\n\r\nB.\tStationary source and regulated substances handled within this facility consists of a Corn Dry Milling plant that processes corn into value products such as ethanol and dry specialty products along with a Cogeneration facility that supplies the facility's energy requirements.\r\nIn this Risk Management Plan, VCP has included programs for its denaturant used in the production of fuel ethanol. The denaturant (natural gasoline) used at the facility has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4. Therefore, VCP has included provisions in the Risk Management Plan for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure. \r\nNatural gasoline is a mixture of predominantly aliphatic hydrocarbons, the most predominant being pentanes.  \r\nC.\tTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis, VCP used RMP*Comp and Aloha Version 5.3 provided by the EPA. Aloha was used to model the liquid release rate in the alternate scenario, while RMP*Comp was used to estimate the distance to the endpoint.\r\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable substances that are normally liquids at ambient temperature assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically and the entire contents are released.  The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from a denaturant (natural gasoline) storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint is overpr"

Safe handling procedures, control devices, and work practices make this scenario extremely unlikely.\r\nA more realistic release scenario involving pentane would be a break in the line supplying liquid denaturant from the storage tank to the process, or storage tank leak.\r\nD.\tThe key concepts in this facility's accidental release prevention program are the elements of the EPA's Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements, which this facility is subject to. These concepts include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractors.\r\n\r\nE.\tThe facility has not had any accidents in the past five years involving pentane that requires reporting under the EPA's Risk Management Rule.\r\n\r\nF.\tEmergency response at the facility is coordinated with the VCP personnel and the Peoria Fire Department, so that in the event of an accident, immediate response measures will be implemented. This facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which addresses response to accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency Planning Team meets monthly, handles issues that need improvement, and sets up training for individuals.\r\n\r\nG.\tBased upon the Hazard Review and the PHA process, a new pump is planned on being added to eliminate the need for the denaturant truck to be running in order to operate their pump during the tank filling process. VCP plans on installing a pump, suitable for the hazardous environment, to further remove any potential of release by eliminating a gasoline/diesel engine from running during the tank filling process."
