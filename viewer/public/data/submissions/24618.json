IPG must comply with the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act.  It is IPG's policy to adhere to all applicable State and Federal regulations regarding the handling of TDI.  TDI is the only chemical on-site that is handled by IPG that is regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP).\nIPG is committed to the safety of its employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our risk management system will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.\n\nDescription of the Facility and Processes using TDI\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture adhesive tape which is then sold for distribution.  TDI is one of the reactants needed to produce the substrate used in the construction of specialty adhesive tape products.  TDI is received into the plant via 55 gallon drums weighing approximately 450 pounds each.  IPG stores approximately 8,000-30,000 pounds of TDI at any given time.  During the mixing process, approximately 217 gallons of TDI or 2204 pounds, are mixed in a large vessel with other reactants and heated to 225 degrees Fahrenheit to produce a component used in the construction of certain products.   TDI is covered under the RMP rule because of the maximum stored onsite will occasionally exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was perform"

The OCA consists of evaluating the worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  IPG does not expect the WRS to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like IPG.  ARSs help IPG to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.  The main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of a WRS or an ARS (called the endpoint distance.)  \n\n    Worst case Release Scenario:\n    The WRS is defined as a catastrophic failure of the AC mixture tank containing all 217 gallons (2204 pounds) of TDI before TDI has had time to react with the other reactants.  The AC Mixer has the potential to store the greatest quantity of TDI whose failure produces the greatest distance to endpoint.  During hot weather the TDI could reach elevated ambient temperatures.  Because a release at a higher temperature would result in the greatest endpoint, the highest temperature recorded in Columbia within the last three years of 109 degrees Fahrenheit was used for modeling purposes.  It was also assumed that the entire contents of the vessel were released as a liquid into a dike measuring approximately 150 cubic feet.  The EPA approved RMP Comp model predicts a distance of 0.4 miles from the release area to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/L).  The model calculated release rate of 0.0176 pounds/minute and release duration of 125,000 minutes, however the RMP Submit does not allow in Section 2.6 and 2.7 an input value of a number less than 0.1 or greater than 9999.9, respectively.  Therefore the minimum at maximum values for these sections were input into these sections.  Due to the close proximity of a neighboring facility and the distance to endpoint, a TDI WCS could potent"

No environmental receptors would be affected.\n    \nAlternative Release Scenario\nIPG has modeled an ARS of a rupture of two 55 gallon drums with an approximate weight of 900 pounds due to puncture from a forklift.  It was assumed that the release was immediate and that all of the contents spilled unto the concrete floor.  The resulting pool would cover an area of approximately 200 square feet. The average temperature for the Columbia area according to the weather Bureau is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.  EPA approved Model; Aloha 5.2.3 predicts a distance of less than 10 meters from the pool to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm or 0.007 mg/L.  The model calculated release rate of 0.00922 pounds/minute and release duration of 60 minutes, however the RMP Submit does not allow in Section 2.6 an input value of a number less than 0.1, and therefore the minimum value of 0.1for was used.  \n\nRelease Prevention Program\nIPG has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  The IPG facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) the WRS for TDI could impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM).  IPG's accidental release prevention program was designed and developed to systematically achieve the following:\n1.

The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI processes.  Collectively these prevention plan activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors and by management system failures.  In addition to the accidental release prevention program, IPG has safety features on its units to help contain or control a release, quickly detect a release and to reduce the consequence of a release.  The following are some of the safety features:\n1.    Dike around the process to contain all TDI that could potentially be released\n2.    Manual shutdown systems\n3.
