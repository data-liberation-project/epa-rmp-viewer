      "SummaryText": "The Federal-Mogul, Wiper Products (ANCO) facility in Michigan City, Indiana is a world class manufacturer of windshield wiper blades.  Chlorine is used in the manufacturing of wiper blades to give the rubber windshield wiper elements a smooth finish so that they will glide smoothly over the windshield.  Chlorine is stored in (3) 2000 lb. cylinders (1 standby, 2 individually connected to the process).  The chlorine is stored in a building adjacent to the manufacturing plant where it is drawn into the process, as a gas, and mixed with water.  Upon completion of the chlorination process, the chlorine in the water is neutralized prior to disposal.  The process contains alkaline scrubbers to remove chlorine from any process off-gas.  Because the system operates under a vacuum from the regulator to the chlorinators, the risk of a substantial chlorine release to the air is minimal.  The process is equipped with alarms and valves to enable quick isolation of various processelements in the event of an emergency.  The greatest risk of a major chlorine release is associated with the 200 lb cylinders located in the chlorine storage building.\n\nIt is important to note that ANCO has never had a release of chlorine gas with off-site consequences.\n\nANCO is committed to the health & safety of its employees and the community.  To minimize the risks associated with the use of chlorine in its process, ANCO has taken the following steps to prevent or mitigate the consequences of an accidental release of chlorine:\n\nProcess Control\n  \n  Rigorous Compliance with Standards and Codes\n  Structured Hazard Analysis\n  Comprehensive Preventive Maintenance\n  Vacuum gas delivery system with regulators attached directly to chlorine cylinders\n\nOperations and Training\n  \n  Documented Operating Procedures\n  Ongoing Employee Training\n  Strict Contractor Rules\n  Employee Participation and Operation Review\n\nManagement and Auditing\n  \n  Management of Change Process\n  Comprehensive Incident Investigation and"
