The BD is transferred into tanker trucks for transport to the MCP facility located at 2800 Morehead Road in Charlotte NC, approximately 10 miles away. The BD is then used in  manufacturing operations at the MCP Morehead facility. There have been no RQ releases in the past 5 years and no off site impacts, on-site injuries or property damage as a result of operations at this location. MCP conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) at five (5) year intervals or when changes occur or new projects are implemented. MCP follows Good Engineering Practices (GEP), utilizes a computerized preventative maintenance and documented Mechanical Integrity programs conducted by qualified personnel. The OSHA Mechanical Integrity program includes critical equipment checks and testing to confirm /validate reliability. All equipment modifications are formally reviewed and approved through a Management of Change process by qualified personnel and before equipment is placed into service.    \n\n\n\nRoutine inspections and audits of the Speed-Rail safety programs are conducted both internally by the compliance and process engineering groups as well as external inspectors from the local fire department and Insurance carrier inspectors. The Speed-Rail facility utilizes a formal documented Accident / Incident reporting system to include near misses. This process reviews all incident to identify the root cause for prevention and follow-up. \n\n\n\nThe Speed-Rail facility is normally unmanned unless transfer operations are being conducted. One(1)employee is typically present when transfers are being made.During those periods when the Speed-Rail is unmanned, the site is monitored remotely 24 hours per day by the MCP Morehead facility. When BD transfers are being made from a rail car to a tanker truck, trained operators are present who possess the skill and ability to complete the BD transfer. Formal writ"

Monitoring and safety procedures include safety interlocks,check valves, pressure sensors, etc. Only authorized personnel are allowed on-site.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policies and Procedures are in place to address accidental leaks and releases. The Plan is designed to ensure that MCP responds effectively to emergency situations to protect MCP personnel, the public and environment. The ER Plan includes a designated Emergency Coordinator with written procedures to be followed in the event of a BD leak or release. The EC will coordinate with local emergency responders such as the Harrisburg Fire department, Hazmat responders and be responsible for emergency notifications to the police, medical responders and governmental agencies. \n\n\n\nResponse procedures include activation of alarm systems,deluge and fire pump systems,SDS information, response equipment and site plans. MCP personnel are routinely trained on fire reponses, spill prevention and countermeasures and hazardous material handling.
