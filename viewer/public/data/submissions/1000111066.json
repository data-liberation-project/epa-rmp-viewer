Box 429 York, NE 68467\r\nMailing Address\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFacility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of\r\nan accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations. In the event an\r\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s),\r\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\r\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to\r\npeople and the environment.\r\n\r\nFacility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, establishments primarily engaged in\r\noperating country or terminal grain elevators, however we are also engaged in providing agricultural\r\ninputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to\r\nfarmers in our area. The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is #493130 farm product warehousing and storage. Although Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be\r\nnoted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under\r\nconsideration as a listed substance. We include Propane (as well as all crop protectants and\r\npetroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\r\nthe early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.\r\nThe maximum Quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is"

The maximum\r\nquantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer tank (ranging from 40,000\r\nto 42,000 lbs.)\r\n\r\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and\r\nreloading of product for delivery. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080-hour\r\nrequirement to qualify as a full-time employee on site, therefore item number 1.11 is zero. Time\r\nexpended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Program:\r\n\r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\r\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and\r\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\r\n(OSHA)standard 29CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. We conduct\r\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,\r\nEmergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to\r\nprevent tampering when the site is unattended. We also maintain routine contact with our local fire\r\ndepartment and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety\r\ntraining exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia. We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for\r\nemployees, customers, and visitor's protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of\r\ngod that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of\r\nour company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.

We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia and Propane training programs by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, community planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities.
