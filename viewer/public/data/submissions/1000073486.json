              "Description": "Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThis process is a batch style process for a specific agricultural product. This system is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of ammonia held in the storage tank. The unloading of ammonia tank trucks is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.  Ammonia pump (10-110-045B)\n\n\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. All nozzles on the tank are fitted with excess flow valves except for nozzles with pressure relief valves. A local level indicator is available on the tank with a transmitter conveying  the level measurement into the control room. This instrument is used to monitor and control the tank level.\n\n\n\nThe pressure relief valves are tested annually. The entire system undergoes annual maintenance which includes: external inspection, checks for any leaks, bolt tightness on the manway. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is transferred to an ammonia / water mixer to prepare a solution that is pumped to a surge tank . The solution is then pumped to the chemical processing equipment and used to manufacture an agricultural product.\n\n\n\nAll changes to this system fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. Hazard reviews are conducted for all changes.",

              "Description": "Chlorine is transported to the plant site in one ton cylinders. These cylinders are transported on a flat-bed truck trailer equipped with a boom for off loading. One ton cylinders are widely available and are used in variety of industries. The chlorine supplier owns and maintains the cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe cylinders are off loaded with the boom and placed into cradles designed to transport and store the cylinders. The cradles are equipped with rollers for correctly orienting the cylinder valves and are also equipped with the means to securely lock the cylinder in place on the cradle. A forklift truck is used to transport the cylinder and  cradle to the cylinder storage shed. The shed is designed to protect the cylinders from the weather.\n\n\n\nThe forklift truck is also used to move the cylinders to the vaporizer building when chlorine is needed in the manufacturing process. One cylinder will be connected to the vaporization process equipment at a time. A maximum of eight cylinders will be allowed in the dispensing or vaporizer building at any time.\n\n\n\nUnique pipe fittings are utilized to ensure that only chlorine is transferred to the process. The piping system is designed to minimize potential leak spots.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine vaporizer or dispensing building is inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems. It is also monitored continuously for chlorine leaks. If a leak is detected, the system will alarm, shutdown the transfer equipment, and automatically start ventilating  equipment. Trained operating staff will respond accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine transfer system and processing equipment are equipped with instruments for monitoring the process. The system is designed to prevent events such as tank overfilling and over pressurization. The process is monitored  continuously by control and interlock systems as well as trained operating personnel. A relatively low chlorine inventory in maintained in the process vessels. It reacts immediately.\n\n\n\nThis process operating procedures and administrative controls are designed to limit the chlorine inventory in the storage shed and dispensing buildings.  The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n\n\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. Hazard reviews are conducted for all changes.",
