All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to.  Dole Fresh Vegetables' emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is also in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThis facility consists of the Value Added Facility which is prepared to cool, clean, and package fresh vegetables, primarily for salads.  Anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are stored at this facility.  The Value Added Facility uses 41,824 pounds of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration and 10,000 pounds of liquified chlorine gas for disinfectant.  The chlorine system with the Value Added Facility is a separate process from the ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n-High level of training of the operators.\n\n-Preventive maintenance program.\n\n-Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n-Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n\n-Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of ammonia supply or chlorine supply, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of these toxic substances.\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe facility has its own emergency response program.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted once every year; emergency operations and re"
