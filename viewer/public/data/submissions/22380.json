Facility Policy.\n\nThe owner, management and employees of Geneva Elevator Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the North Central Regional Emergency Planning District, local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the resale of fertilizer to area farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 190,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .75 miles.\n                                                                                                                                                                   b. The alternate release scenario, is a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of A"

(ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, C Section 8.3.(b).\n\n5. Five - Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries of or property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there ben any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n                                                                                                                                                                    b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of Geneva Elevator Co. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
