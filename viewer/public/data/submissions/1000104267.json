RMEC has taken several technical and administrative steps beyond those specified in the standards to prevent releases.  Passive mitigation includes a secondary containment berm and redundant storage and handling equipment.  A deluge system provides active mitigation.\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nRocky Mountain has no history of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nAll RMEC personnel are trained to a hazard awareness level, in the emergency action plan, and facility safety and environmental procedures annually.  Some employees have additional responsibilities and training under the facility's Operating Procedures and Emergency Response procedure.  Coordination with Hudson Fire Department and other emergency responders is accomplished through the 9-1-1 system in an emergency.\n\nPublic Meeting:  \nAfter March 15, 2021, conduct a public meeting within 90-days of any RMP reportable incident resulting in offsite impact(s) - death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage [40 CFR 68.42(a)].  During the public meeting information to be provided is contained in 40 CFR 68.42(b). \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nRMEC has established Safety, Environmental, Health procedures that continue to maintain site and public safety.  A training component is incorporated into the monthly Safety Meeting schedule."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nROCKY MOUNTAIN ENERGY CENTER\n\nThe facility and the regulated substance handled:  \n\nRocky Mountain Energy Center (RMEC) is a 600 MW combined-cycle electric generation facility located in a rural area of Weld County Colorado, near the towns of Hudson and Keenesburg.  It is a zero-liquid-discharge facility and employs state of the art equipment and processes to control air emissions.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the selective catalytic reduction process to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX).  Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic chemical and an uncontrolled release could be hazardous to employees and to the public.  The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a liquid under pressure in two storage tanks, each with a 62,161-pound (12,070-gallon) usable capacity.\n\nFacility's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia necessitates a facility Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as a Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Because both programs focus on the health and safety concerns of storing and processing anhydrous ammonia, Rocky Mountain Energy Center has developed these two programs together. RMEC is a secure facility that is attended 24/7. The ammonia storage and distribution system is continually monitored and inspected during operator rounds daily. Plant personnel have been trained to operate and maintain the ammonia system to the highest standards.\n\nXcel Energy has made a major commitment to worker safety and environmental compliance at its facilities nationwide.  Comprehensive corporate guidelines govern the development of all facility safety, health, and environmental procedures.  Facility employees conduct monthly safety meetings and participate in daily morning meeting to discuss upcoming evolutions, co-ordinate work objectives, and discuss current safety, environmental, and health concerns.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention and chemical-sp"
