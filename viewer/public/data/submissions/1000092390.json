The following elements are addressed in the program:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPreventing the release of toxic and flammable chemicals is of paramount importance at the Margarine Plant due to the serious acute health or catastrophic effects that may result from exposure to toxic fumes or an explosion.  Management has made it clear that all leaks are to be taken seriously and that operation of the system is expected to be performed in a careful and professional manner.  The Emergency Response Policy is predicated on the serious nature of any toxic or flammable chemical leak and stresses the importance of calling in properly trained and equipped employees or resources when a leak is beyond the capabilities of on-site employees.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Margarine Plant is owned by Stratas Foods, LLC and is located at 2731 Refinery Road, Quincy, Illinois, 62305.  The facility packages margarine, liquid oils, and shortenings.  The Margarine Plant uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to chill the refrigerated warehouse and to crystallize the oil using scraped surface heat exchangers.  \n\n\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario was built on the assumption that the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-8590) ruptured and discharged its entire contents over a ten minute period. HPR-8590 is designed to be able to hold the entire ammonia charge in emergency situations, as well as maintenance periods for draining other vessels and pipelines.  For worst case, it was assumed that the entire ammonia charge was in the High Pressure Receiving when the rupture occurred.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios for the system involves the case of an individual compressor system experiencing a piping flange gasket failure and releasi"

General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for ammonia-specific prevention steps are detailed in the Margarine Plant's Process Safety Management Plan for the ammonia refrigeration area.  This program is maintained by the Margarine Plant Manager and covers areas such as standard operating procedures, employee training, etc.\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years from the date of this plan, the Margarine Plant has had no accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration system which would require notification.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Margarine Plant emergency response procedures are detailed in the Process Safety Management Plan, which is maintained by the Margarine Plant Manager.  Essentially, properly trained Margarine Plant employees will handle small leaks, while more significant leaks will require the assistance of outside responders.\n\n\n\n7.
