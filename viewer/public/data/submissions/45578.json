      "SummaryText": "PORT ARTHUR:   TERMINAL DOCK\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, operates a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing plant in Port Arthur, Texas.  Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are ChevronTexaco Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.   Both ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nOne of the feedstocks to the Chevron Phillips manufacturing plant is a propylene/propane mixture and is received by barge and stored in bullets.  The unloading facility and bullets are remotely located from the manufacturing plant.  The feedstock is transferred via pipeline from the bullets to the manufacturing plant.  This RMP only covers the unloading & storage facility for the propylene/propane mixture.  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Dock unloading facility.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal employs approximately 5 full time equivalent employees.  This facility is managed by Mr. Richard Cuneo, Plant Manager.   Mr. Ralph Edwards, Compliance Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-722-4371) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.  Chevron Phillips Chemical Emergency Response Group would also respond to any event at the "

      "SummaryText": "Dock facility.  The Dock facility is covered by emergency procedures and processes from both the main facility and the Dock.  \n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management and Coast Guard regulations.  We are in substantial compliance with the PSM and Coast Guard regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment.  We are also in compliance with these regulations.  \n\nWe have had no RMP reportable accidents for any RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years at the Port Arthur Terminal Dock.  \n\nChevron Phillips Chemical is constantly reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work and to minimize environmental impacts.  Although we have adopted a program of continuous improvement, at this time, we currently have no plans to implement any major changes to our plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems.  The facility continually uses the MOC / PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified."
