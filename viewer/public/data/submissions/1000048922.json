The system is utilized to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  The majority of the mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  Foster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations as required in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The RMP regulations apply to facilities that handle, manufacture, use, or store toxic and flammable substances above specified threshold quantities. In addition to the RMP regulations, both the State of Washington and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, as defined in Washington Administrative Code (WAC), Chapter 296 67, and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.

Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.  Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team for mitigation of the release.  Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary. \r\n\r\nThe Foster Farms facility is located at 1700 South 13th Avenue in Kelso, Washington.  The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses.  The facility is in an industrial park that is generally bordered by Interstate 5 on the northeast and the Kelso Airport on the southwest.  The Cowlitz River, residential, and commercial development are located northwest of the industrial park.\r\n\r\nThe facility was constructed in 1998 for Foster Farms.  Operations at the facility consist of the processing of live chickens, storage, packaging and shipment of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.

The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves; float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Kelso facility due to the quantity of ammonia used and the process is subject to the PSM regulations. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility. This facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms reported no reportable accidental releases at the facility within the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia system is continuously monitored by an automated control system that shuts down components if deviations from normal operating conditions"
