It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at City of Rockport Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Rockport Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and The Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCity of Rockport Wastewater Treatment Plant complies with the EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source."
