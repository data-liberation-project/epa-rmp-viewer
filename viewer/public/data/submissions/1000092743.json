Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  The covered process is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  The equipment used to make 10-34-0 fertilizer is a T-reactor which combines anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.",

Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of WinField United. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Mills County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the manufacturer and distribution of fertilizer products.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used to manufacture fertilizers as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is combined with Superphosphoric Acid and water in a T-Reactor to make a liquid fertilizer called 10-34-0 which is stored in large tanks onsite.\n\n\n\n3.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility complies with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The process of manufacturing fertilizer using anhydrous ammonia also complies with OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. The facility complies with EPCRA SARA Tier II regulations as well as the State of Iowa stormwater regulations.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations. Components of the Prevention Program include identifying the safety\n\nhazards and characteristics of the ammonia, conducting a hazard review to identify best management practices, developing operating procedures, conducting training on the safe operating\n\nprocedures, employing a preventative maintenance program, conducting periodic compliance audits, investigating incidents involving ammonia and maintaining documentation of the imp"

Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and Community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc.    If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency \n\n        Action Plan.\n\n\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWinField United has continual personnel training to reduce the potential for accidental chemical releases.  This is accomplished by periodic evaluations, inspections, testing, and upgrading serves to prevent releases from equipment failures.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  \n\n\n\n"
