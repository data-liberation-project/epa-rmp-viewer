(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOKA?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems; by the personal commitments of employees and contractors; and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Yaggy Facility is operated by ONEOK Hydrocarbon, L.P.  Historically, the facility was operated as a natural gas storage facility; storing natural gas in underground caverns and transporting it out of the facility, via pipeline, when needed.  As such the facility was exempt from reporting under the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule as it was operated under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.  The facility is currently being de-inventoried via brine displacement and no longer receives natural gas.  Present operations are not regulated by DOT, therefore the facility is now subject to the RMP rule.  At this time, storage capacity of natural gas is greater than the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity.  The only regulated substance stored at the facility is natural gas, which is reported in this RMP as a flammable mixture composed of methane, ethane, and propane."

      "SummaryText": "  \n\nThe facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation based on the absence of any public receptors within the distance to flammable endpoint of a worst-case release assessment and the fact that the facility has not had an accidental release of an RMP substance within the past five years that resulted in any offsite impacts.  \n\n\n \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\nA?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\nA?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nA?    Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Yaggy Facility accidental release program includes the ongoing analysis of potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and constant emphasis on safety.  This program has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of the program involves identifying and taking steps to help prevent chemical releases.  Following are some examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility:\n\nA?    The alarm system at the facility may be manually activated from the control room or, in the case of an emergency shutdown at the wellhead, the alarm will automatically sound alerting personnel of a possible problem at the wellhead.\nA?    The automatic emergency shutdown system in place at the wellheads will activate if set points are exceeded for LEL, high brine pressure differential (flow), high gas pressure differential (flow), low brine pressure, flame"

Combustible gas detectors are located at the wellheads that are actively removing gas.\nA?    The control room is manned 24 hours per day with continuous electronic monitoring of pressure switches and LEL detectors.\nA?    All safety systems at the wellheads are formally inspected at least annually.  Additionally, personnel monitor these systems as part of their daily rounds.\n    \n    \n    Five-Year Accident History\n    \n    No incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from an RMP substance release has occurred at the Yaggy Facility within the past five years. \n    \n    \n    Emergency Response Program\n    \n    The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Yaggy Facility with the Reno County Office of Emergency Management.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Reno County Sheriff, the Nickerson and Hutchinson Fire Departments, and the Kansas Highway Patrol.  The Storage Operations Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n    \n    \n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n    \n    Compliance with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n    \nA?    Safety training, including 24-hour training and 8-hour annual refresher training, to ensure competency in the duties and functions required of each employee.\nA?    Regular emergency drills ensure a constant state of readiness for all empl"
