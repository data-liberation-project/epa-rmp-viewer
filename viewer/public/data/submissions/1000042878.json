      "SummaryText": "The Salem Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility owned by the City of Salem, IL and is located on Spillway Road on the north edge of Salem, IL.  The facility is manned by six (6) full time operators who are all experienced in the safe handling of toxic chemicals such as chlorine.  The Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine as well as other chemicals to treat raw water from the Salem Reservoir and provide safe drinking water for the City of Salem.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the Water Treatment Plant is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance at the facility which is above the threshold limit.  Chemical safety is a concern of the Salem Water Treatment Plant and is attained by operators skilled in the handling of toxic chemicals as well as release prevention operations and an Emergency Response Plan.  The facility has coordinated with the Salem Fire Protection District to implement an Emergency Response Plan to be used in theevent of an accidental chlorine release.  Safe chemical handling practices, as well as ongoing inspection and maintenance of the complete chlorination system has resulted in no accidental releases of chlorine within the last ten (10) years at the Salem Water Treatment Plant, however, a plan is in effect to handle an accidental release should such an event occur in the future.  The chlorinator alarm sensors were recently replaced (March 12, 2013) and the WTP RPZ was recently inspected on 2/25/2014.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for the Salem Water Treatment Plant includes routine daily inspection of the complete chlorination system which results in maintenance performed on an as-needed basis.  The facility is equipped with a chlorine leak detector in the chlorination area with an audible an visible alarm within the plant.  The facility also has a portable chlorine monitor which can be used to check the chlorine concentration in areas around the perimeter of the facility in the event of an acc"

      "SummaryText": "idental release of chlorine.  It is the policy of the facility that when 1-ton chlorine cylinders are changed, two operators, both wearing SCBA's are used to complete the cylinder change in case of an accidental release.  The Emergency Response Plan developed for the Salem Water Treatment Plant has been coordinated with the Salem Fire Protection District along with other local emergency responders.  The plan is designed to prepare Water Treatment Plant operators, as well as local emergency responders, for an accidental release of chlorine and what actions are required of the operators and responders to repair the leak and protect the public.  The City Manager is responsible for implementation of the Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes specific actions to be to be taken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine from the facility.  The Chief Water Treatment Plant Operator is responsible for responding to a chlorine leak alarm of the strong odor of chlorine by evacuating operators and notifying emergency responders.  The Chief Operator, along with the Fire and Police Departments, will determine the need for shelter or evacuation of the surrounding community depending on the severity of the chlorine release.  Emergency treatment of injuries will be handled by local paramedics that would be called on-site along with other emergency responders.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Salem Water Treatment Plant is committed to providing safe drinking water to it's customers, as well as reducing the risk of an accidental release of chlorine through the use of safe chemical handling practices, ongoing inspections and preventitive maintenance.  In the event of an accidental chlorine release, the City of Salem is prepared to respond in accordance with the Emergency Response Plan in order to minimize the impact of the accidental release on the surrounding community and the environment."
