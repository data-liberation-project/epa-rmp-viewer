Heartland Farms (Santee Dairies), founded in 1986, produces and distributes quality dairy products for a wide range of customers from its new City of Industry facility, which was completed in 1998. Santee Dairies' 250,000 sq. ft. plant has fully automated dairy processing and product handling systems.  As stated on their website, Santee Dairies supports a highly trained and experienced team of associates, we utilize the very latest warehouse and distribution technology to provide our customers with the freshest product and the highest customer service levels in the industry. Finally, quality checks are applied throughout the process by our quality control technicians before the finished products are released for distribution.\n\nSantee Dairies' senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Santee Dairies maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Santee Dairies' has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Santee Dairies was built in 1997.

The system and the facility were constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 12,500 pounds of ammonia for the following three main purposes: To provide cooling for 1) dairy processing, 2) warehouse cold storage, and 3) HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) for offices.  With the exception of the condensers and the diffusion box (including associated piping), the entire ammonia system is located inside the engine room.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of ammonia from the thermosyphon receiver to the high pressure receiver.  The thermosyphon receiver also supplies ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  From the high pressure receiver, high pressure liquid ammonia is transferred to three accumulators that maintain ammonia at three different temperatures.  As the ammonia enters each accumulator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the temperature and the pressure.  Each accumulator supplies liquid ammonia to a distinct heat exchanger which provides cooling for one of the three purposes listed above, vaporizing the ammonia.  The heat exchangers are located in the engine room and use a secondary fluid (glycol) to provide the required cooling throughout the facility.\n\nThe vapor is returned to each accumulator in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from two of the accumulators is then pulled to the compressors (6) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  The other accumulator feeds a suction accumulator which transfers the vapor to the compressors and sends any residual liquid to a transfer unit.  Upon a certain level detection in the transfer unit, hot gas from the compressors pressurizes the vessel and the liquid is then returned"

Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (3) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver.  An Auto Purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The system also has a diffusion box (for equalizing pressure between vessels in the system), and a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which is kept full of water.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Santee Dairies facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, all of the ammonia is located inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condensers).  The facility uses a heat transfer medium to provide cooling throughout the plant.\n\nSantee Dairies' ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety associated with the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nDETECTION AND MONITORING: There is one ammonia sensor placed in a strategic location in the engine room.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds, a visible alarm is triggered, and the facility off-site alarm company is notified. The alarm company pages the duty operator via a pager, which prompts the operator to call into the alarm company for further information.  If necessary, the operator will contact the fire department.  In addition, Santee Dairies' personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion"

Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: an emergency shut down button that kills power to the engine room equipment located outside the engine room (one inside the boiler room and one outside the man door to outside the facility). The system can also be shut down electronically by the computer system. There are also relief valves on all pressure vessels and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Santee Dairies' facility accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (March 27, 2009), revealed that there have been no significant releases in the past five years (March 2004 to March 2009) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \u00c2\u00bfnear misses\u00c2\u00bf that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Santee Dairies facility has adopted emergency response procedures and policies.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.

The Plan is distributed to new hires who are required to read and sign a certification page.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in March 2009, which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Santee Dairies facility located at 17851 East Railroad Street in the City of Industry, California.  The Santee Dairies safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
