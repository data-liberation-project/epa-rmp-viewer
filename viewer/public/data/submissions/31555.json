Employee Training\n\n\n\nUsing the Hazard Communication Standard as a guideline the City of Westminster Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed a training program. The program is designed to ensure that all employees of the treatment plant are trained in the hazards associated with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide as covered under the Process Safety Management Program. Designated to develop the training program and review the methodology is the city engineer, the utilities manager and the management staff of the wastewater treatment plant. Designated to conduct the training will be the management staff of the City of Westminster Wastewater Treatment Plant.

These containers are positioned in the center of the room on trunnions with individual loadcells for weight measurement.  The load cells for the chlorination system are wired to a Wizard 4000 cylinder scales unit manufactured by Force Flow Equipment in Concord, California.  The load cells for the dechlorination system are hydraulic with analog readouts manufactured by Force Flow Equipment.  These instruments are for monitoring the daily usage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Cylinder tare weights supplied by the chemical manufacturer are used to calculate the remaining quantities of chemical in the cylinder.\n\n\n\nTwo (2) 150 pound chlorine cylinders are attached to the return chlorination system at all times.  These containers are positioned in the upright position on a Wallace and Tiernan 150 pound cylinder scale system.  Full cylinders are positioned on the scale and the scale is adjusted to read 150 pounds.  When the cylinder is empty the scales read zero.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination and dechlorination systems at the Westminster Wastewater Treatment Plant are equipped with all of the necessary apparatuses, including but not limited to approved valves, whips, piping, flanges, vacuum regulators, filters, gauges, sensors, annunciator alarms, etc., for feeding this extremely hazardous chemical.  Further, the piping and valving configurations have been so installed as to provide maximum flexibility and feed options.\n\n\n\nThe ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are filled to a 70/30 - chlorine liquid to gas ratio.

      "SummaryText": "accomplished by the proper positioning of the two valves on the face of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide containers.  When these containers are set on the trunnions and prepared for service, the container is rotated so the valves are in a vertical perspective.  The top valve draws off gas that can be directly fed through a chlorinator or dechlorinator whichever the case may be.  The wastewater plant is not equipped to feed liquid chlorine or liquid sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nThe safe yield of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas off of a one ton container is 400 pounds per day and 40 pounds per day from a 150 pound cylinder.  If the demands are greater than this, the gas will quickly turn into a solid and render the chlorination and or the dechlorination system inoperative.  The only mode of operation at the Westminster facility is to feed regulated chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas directly to the chlorinators and dechlorinators, where the demands are significantly lower than the 400 pounds per day maximum withdraw rate.\n\n\n\nChlorinators and dechlorinators at the Westminster plant are the solution-feed vacuum type.  A water injector is used to create a vacuum that draws the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas through the chlorinator and/or dechlorinator and provide a solution feed.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas is maintained under vacuum throughout the chlorinators and dechlorinators.\n\n\n\nThis type of chlorine and sulfur dioxide feed equipment is highly recommended because safe operation is assured.  The chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas feed is automatically shut off if the water pressure used to draw the vacuum is stopped for any reason.\n\n\n\nThe average daily usage of chlorine at the Westminster Plant is 125 pounds per day and for sulfur dioxide the average rate is 150 pounds per day at the present average daily flows.

Because chlorine is stored in and used directly from one ton containers, it would require the complete discharge of a single one ton container simultaneously with, a partial discharge of one (1) or more additional containers to achieve such a large release quantity.  Such as release quantity could also occur with the partial discharge of at least two (2) or more ton containers such that the total of all the discharges equaled or exceeded 2,500 pounds.\n\n\n\n6.1    Fire Hazards         \n\n\n\nMinimal fire hazards exist that would impact upon the chlorination system and components.  In the event of a fire, adequate fire protection exists nearby in the form of fire extinguishers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2        Impact Hazards\n\n\n\nIf fire can be eliminated as a potential cause for an accidental release at this facility, an accidental release due to line breakage or container rupture from physical impact may be the next most credible catastrophic accident.  The most likely scenario would be if someone were to trip and fall onto the flexible connections which connect the supply containers to the tank switch over, since this connection represents the weakest component in the piping system.  However, since only one cylinder is being drawn off at a time the maximum possible release from a broken chlorine line would be 2,000 lbs. of gas chlorine or sulfur dioxide at a flow rate of about 16 lb/min at 70 F.  For a full container, at this rate, it would take approximately 125 minutes or just over two hours for the entire contents of the container to be released.\n\n\n\n6.3        Fusible Plug Failure\n\n\n\nThe corrosion induced failure (total loss) of a fusible plug may also be a credible event leading to catastrophic release.

The failure frequency of such a release was calculated as the failure frequency of one (1) of the components multiplied by the probability that the other component would fail at the same time.  Because failure frequency data is not currently available for fusible plugs, failure data for similar equipment components compiled for the general nuclear and chemical industries was used.  Such data for a number of components is presented in Table 3.  Assuming that a fusible plug can be simulated as a pipe or welded pipe joint, the failure frequency of simultaneous corrosion induced failure on two (2) separate ton containers was estimated to be nearly zero.  Details of this calculation are presented in Attachment C.  Therefore, in the absence of fire, the simultaneous failure of fusible plugs on two (2) containers does not appear to be a credible accident.\n\n\n\n6.4        Operator Error\n\n\n\nOperator error is one of the more common causes of accidents in the chemical process industries.  The ?failure frequency? for several types of operator error are presented in Table 3.  The most probable operator error which would lead to a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release is likely to occur during replacement of the supply containers on the chlorine or sulfur dioxide scales.  Movement of the ton containers with the electric hoist and lifting beam presents the greatest potential for impact damage due to operator error.  Small releases of chlorine may also result if the operator follows the incorrect procedures when replacing the flexible connection, or forgets to replace the lead washer every time a new container is connected.  However, such omissions are unlikely to lead to large releases of chlorine, especially not exceeding 2,500 pounds in one (1) hour, since this would have to involve simultaneous releases from two (2) containers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5        Terrorist Activity    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Since September "

All lines at the Westminster Plant are under vacuum.  A vacuum line break would cause a loss of vacuum which would cause the vacuum regulator valves to close.\n\n\n\nWhat if a chlorine container ruptures?\n\n\n\nThe quantity and rate of a chlorine release from a container rupture depends on whether there is a full or partial rupture.  For a partial rupture, it also depends on whether the rupture is in the vapor space or below the liquid level.  A worse case is a full rupture of a full container which would instantaneously release 2,000 lbs. of chlorine.  Listed below are some potential causes for rupture.\n\n\n\n1) Failure of a defective container;\n\n2) Failure due to a liquid-full container, with failure of  valve packing to leak                        (which could prevent the rupture by relieving the hydrostatic pressure);\n\n3) Failure due to excessive physical shock;\n\n4) Failure due to excessive heat or fire with simultaneous failure fusible plugs to                melt.\n\n\n\nThe facility has little control over a defective container that it does not own and will have to rely on the chlorine/sulfur dioxide supplier to ensure the integrity of the containers delivered to the facility.  The supplier for this facility will be responsible for periodically and carefully inspecting each container according to rigid quality control procedures.  All containers are registered with a specific serial number by the supplier which is stamped into the metal chime of each container.  In addition, containers are individually tagged and numbered so the operating and maintenance history of each container can be tracked.  Furthermore, visual inspections will be made of all containers delivered to the facility by facility employees, and containers which appear to be improperly maintained will be sent back to the supplier.\n\n\n"

Since ton containers are normally on scales as they are being refilled by the supplier, and the final shipping weight of each container is normally recorded, the chances of receiving an overfilled container from the supplier are minimal.\n\n\n\nExcessive physical shock could occur by collision between a container and another object while the container is on the delivery truck, during transfer from the truck or within the facility.  Specified proper handling procedures and equipment are used to prevent this from occurring.  According to a spokesman from the Chlorine Institute, the containers themselves are designed to withstand considerable physical shock and are reported to be capable of withstanding a drop of over ten (10) feet onto a hard surface.\n\n\n\nExcessive heat or fire is a possible cause of container rupture under certain circumstances, e.g., if the container was exposed to a high temperature heat source and the fusible plugs failed to melt, or if the container was overfilled by the supplier, subjected to a temperature increase after arriving at the facility, and became liquid full.  As discussed in the Hazard Analysis, the chances that a fire will occur at our near the chlorine facility are minimal.\n\nThe chlorine storage room is heated with forced air heaters.

Twelve sewer pumping stations and some 65 miles of sewer lines convey raw wastewater from the end user to the wastewater plant located at the corner of Route 31 and Old New Windsor Pike.  The City's wastewater plant is an activated sludge process designed to treat five million gallon of wastewater per/day.\n\n\n\nRaw wastewater enters the plant through a 48 inch influent line. Trash is removed by means of an automated bar screen.  Grease and grit are removed via a Schreiber Grease and Grit removal system.  After primary treatment, the screened flow, travels through open channels to a splitter mechanism. Raw wastewater and plant return activated sludge are combined at the influent slitter mechanism and divided between four reactors. This plant is an M.L.E. biological nutrient removal system. After biological treatment, tertiary treatment is achieved by adding aluminum sulfate (Alum)to the mixed liquor for reduction of phosphorous levels in the effluent.  The mixed liquor is divided between three secondary clarifiers to separate the clear treated water from the return activated sludge.  The return sludge pumping station is the location of the return chlorine system.  As described earlier in the plan return chlorine is for the control of filamentous bacteria in the biological process.  After clarification, the flow (plant effluent) is chlorinated in the chlorine contact tank.  Effluent flow through a raceway of baffles to ensure the chlorine solution is thoroughly mixed with the effluent.  Flow measurement is taken prior to flow entering the dechlorination chamber by an ultrasonic flow meter.  In the dechlorination chamber a sulfonated water solution is added to neutralize the residual chlorine remaining in the effluent.  Air is induced in the dechlorination chamber to provide mixing and elevate the effluent dissolved oxygen to meet N.P.D.E.S. permit requirements.  The t"
