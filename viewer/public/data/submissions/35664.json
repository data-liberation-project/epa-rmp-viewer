The 23rd Ave Treated Water Storage Facility accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates advanced technologies, procedures, and management practices. The facility emergency response policy involves utilization of, and coordination with, offsite responders to address potential chlorine related incidents.  B.  The Treated Water Storage Facility serves the customers in Greeley, Co.  The facility stores 67 million gallons of treated water that is delivered to the facility from our two water treatment plants.  The facility adds chlorine to the treated water that it stores to maintain adequate residual disinfection action as the water is distributed to the customer.  The distribution/disinfection building consists of three rooms.  One room contains two vacuum type chlorinators and vacuum piping that extend into a second room which congains two one-ton chlorine containers, scales, hoists, and tools required for the process.  The third room contains the electrical panels, flow recorders, chlorine alarm and various safety equipment.  The chlorine container room and chlorinator room have piping which connects to a chlorine scrubber.  The facility is normally staffed from 7:30 - 4:00 Mon thru Fri.  Operators who have been trained and certified in the operation and maintenance of the chlorination equipment are on call 24/7 and will respond to to any alarms that may occur.  The alarm systems accivates an alarm on the system computer that is operated by a Win-911 system which notified pertinent personnel, and also the city police and fire dispatch office.  Only incidental (known and immediately controllable) events are handled by the facility staff.  All other emergency events are responded to by the city's Hazmat Team.  C.  The offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternate release scenarios.  By recommendation of EPA, we choose to not include descri"

      "SummaryText": "ptions of our worst case or alternate release scenarios in this executive summary.  D.  The Treated Water Storage Facility accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:  1.  High level of training of the facility operators and maintenance personnel; 2. Preventive maintenance program; 3. Use of the state of the art process and safety equipment; 4. Use of accurate and effective sops, written with operator participation; 5. Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and implementation of an auditing and inspection program.  Chemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during the connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a reliable and accurate chlorine detection system.  A B kit for one ton containers is also maintained and kept on the plant site for use only by the off-site emergency response steam, if ever needed.  E. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.  F.  The treated water storage facility utilizes local hazard response personnel to respond to emergencies at this facility.  The program has also been reviewd by the Weld County Office of Emergency Management and coordinated with the Union Colony Fire Authority.  All personnel will review these procedures on an annual basis.  G.  Planned changes to improve safety include additional lighting in the chlorine container room and installation of sprinkler system for fire suppression."
