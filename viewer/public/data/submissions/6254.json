              "Description": "\nKUB's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and addresses the following 10 elements tailored to our facility's operations. In accordance with the Process Safety Management provisions incorporated into the Risk Management Program, KUB promotes prevention programs in each of the major areas below: \n\n          Management System\n        The major hazards (e.g., equipment failure, human error, natural phenomena, or a combination of such factors that could lead to a significant accidental release) are identified through the process hazard analysis. The consequences of a failure to control each identified hazard are included in the Process Hazard Analysis documentation for each covered facility.\n\n          Process Hazard Analysis\n        The process hazard analysis is the foundation for the remaining elements of the prevention program. KUB's program uses a team approach and an integrated management system to evaluate the hazards present at the facility and find the best ways to control these hazards. There are various safety and mitigating systems, emergency alarms, and evacuation plans that are utilized to eliminate or reduce the consequences of an off site release.\n\n          Process Safety Information\n        KUB's prevention program enables KUB employees involved in Plant Operations to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving the use of chlorine. The process safety information includes material safety data sheets (MSDS), information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine used in plant processes, process flow diagrams, information pertaining to the technology of processes (i.e., process chemistry, process parameters), and information pertaining to the equipment in processes (i.e., equipment specifications and design, piping, and instrumentation drawings).\n\n          Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\n        KUB has developed SOPs to document the safe and proper way to operate and maintain processes and equipment, and to handle, use, and/or store chlorine at each covered facility.  Procedures are based on the process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) information, past operating experience, manufacturers' recommendations, and applicable and appropriate codes and standards. Process modification and facility complexity is considered whenever SOPs are developed, reviewed, and/or modified.\n\n          Employee Training\n        KUB water and wastewater plant personnel receive HAZWOPER training at the Hazardous Material Technician competency level.  Personnel are trained in all aspects of KUB's emergency response plan, including: potential emergencies, personnel roles and responsibilities, evacuation routes and procedures, and the location of emergency response equipment. Trained personnel receive annual refresher training, including emergency response drills and exercises.  Documentation of all training is maintained by KUB's Learning Center.\n\n          Mechanical Integrity\n        KUB's preventive maintenance program determines and targets the specific equipment that is identified through the process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) or through operating experience as needed.  The procedures for preventive equipment maintenance, inspection, and testing are documented in the Process Safety Management Program for each of KUB's facilities that use chlorine.\n\n          Pre-Startup Safety Review\n        KUB conducts pre-startup safety review to ensure that new or modified equipment is ready to be operated properly and safely, prior to the equipment being placed into service. KUB ensures that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place by overseeing development of safety and emergency procedures and developing detailed operating and maintenance plans.  KUB personnel are adequately trained and qualified for mechanical management and utilize a computerized work order system.\n\n          Management of Change\n        KUB ensures that any alteration of equipment, procedures, or processes is thoroughly analyzed to identify hazards, the consequences of failures, and impacts of the change on existing equipment, procedures, substances, and processes prior to implementation of the change.\n\n          Compliance Audits\n        KUB periodically conducts an audit or comprehensive assessment of the management systems and programs at each facility.  This includes a review of the documentation and implementation of the risk management requirements. According to RMP requirements, KUB conducts a complete compliance audit at each covered facility every three years to ensure that the process safety management elements are in place, updated, and being implemented properly.\n\n          Incident Investigation\n        The final component of KUB's prevention program consists of investigations to discover the underlying (root) causes of accidents or near miss incidents in order to take steps to prevent accidental releases from recurring. Incident investigation is initiated by the Plant Operations Department, with assistance from the Safety Section of the Human Resources Department and personnel from the Technical Services Department. All investigation reports for actual significant accidental releases are kept on file in the Technical Services Department for a period of five (5) years.",

This plan consists of three major components: a Hazard Assessment, a Prevention Program, and an Emergency Response Plan. \n\nFacility Information & Regulated Substances\nFourth Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant\nThe Fourth Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is an \"activated\" secondary wastewater treatment plant with a dry weather design flow of 10.8 MGD.  The maximum chlorine storage capacity at this facility is 16,000 pounds.\n\nOff Site Consequence Analysis\nEach hazard assessment consisted of worst-case and alternative scenarios in order to evaluate the potential impacts of accidental releases of chlorine on the public health and environment.\n \n     Worst Case Release Scenario \n    Fourth Creek uses chlorine in one (1) ton cylinders; therefore, the worst case scenario was based on the assumption that approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine would be released. All calculations for air dispersion modeling were performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped by using the Cameo Suite (Cameo, Marplot, and Aloha).  The worst case scenario was evaluated at a release duration of 10 minutes and at a release rate of 110 pounds/minute.  Air dispersion modeling resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.9 miles.\n\n     Alternative Release Scenario \n    KUB's process hazard analysis (PHA) indicated a chlorine release would most likely occur due to a failure in the chlorination system piping; therefore, modeling for each alternative scenario was based on this assumption. The chlorine scrubber located at this plant was taken into consideration as active mitigation when conducting the alternative scenario. All calculations for the air dispersion modeli"

Even though Fourth Creek has mitigation systems to minimize the likelihood of a release, KUB has a comprehensive emergency response plan that is complete, up-to-date, and supplemented with emergency response training and drills for employees. KUB's Plan has been submitted to and reviewed by the City of Knoxville Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). In the event of an off-site release, the Plan prepares KUB and the Community for a response to and mitigation of accidental chlorine releases in order to limit the severity of such releases and their impact on b"

Use of this system will help ensure that all chlorine feed systems, including emergency monitoring systems, are properly maintained.  Preventive maintenance work orders will be generated automatically and routed to the designated crew.  In addition, MIMS will easily track and record the use of all KUB equipment (trucks, lab equipment, chlorine cylinder repair kits, emergency response equipment) and schedule service appointments periodically to ensure that employees are using the most reliable equipment for each task."
