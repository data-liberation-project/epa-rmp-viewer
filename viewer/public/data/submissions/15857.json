Safety is a requirement to work at this facility.  Management considers safety as a business objective.\n\nThe facility is located Virginia, MN.  The one process at the facility uses methanol to yeild formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involved the release of formaldehyde into a diked area, developing from a mixer seal leak.  The quantity released is 1,000 lbs., at a rate of 5.5 lbs/min.  The release duration is for 180 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The topography is urban.  The RMP Comp program indicated a 1.7 mile distance to the endpoints.  The estimated residential population within the distance to the endpoint was 2,500.\n\nThe alternative worst-case release scenario involved the release of formaldehyde into a diked area, developing from a leaking pipe.  The quantity released is 10 lbs., at a rate of 1.0 lbs/min.  The release duration is for 10 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The topography is urban.  The RMP Comp program indicated a 0.10 mile distance to the endpoints.  The estimated residential population within the distance to the endpoint was 2,500.\n\nSafe operation practices and training help to maintian safety.  Procedures are in place for the safe operations of the plant.  \n\nWithin thepast five years, the process had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program.  No injuries have been recorded in the past five year period.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, and information for informing the public, and local agencies responding to accidental releases.  Emergency health care information is found in plant MSDS sheets.  The local fire department and police will respond to emergencies.  Plan"
