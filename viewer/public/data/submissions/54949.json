Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate the changes. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nIncidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are prompyl investigated for root cause and development of corrective actions.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nTo help ensure proper functioning of the accident prevention program, compliance audits are conducted at least every three years by a team of hourly and staff personnel. Corrective actions taken in response to the team's findings are tracked until complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are maintained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\nSafety features are on many units to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\nChlorine detectors with alarms, local and transmitted to the o"

The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications to the mill. The emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process, which includes informing and /or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Red River Mill is coordinated with the Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Red River mill has around-the-clock communications capability with local LEPC officials and emeergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident. The Red River Mill conducts periodic emergency drills and provides periodic refresher training to mill personnel regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel, and safety considerations in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. International Paper's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Red River Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill that utilizes the standard kraft process for the manufacture of unbleached pulp from wood chips and recycled corrugated containers into linerboard. Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the treatment of incoming water for mill processes. It is the only listed substance present in quantities that exceed the Risk Management Planning (RMP) threshold. In addition, the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Management Standard (PSM). The use of chlorine at Red River Mill is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Red River Mill. Because the RMP regulated process is also subject to OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nActive employee participation in the development and implementation of the PSM program is an important step toward the prevention or minimization of consequences of catastrophic releases of chemicals. Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM are cons"

In addition, employees participate in operational checks and in developing and reviewing operating and maintenance procedures that ensure that processes remain in control. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nWritten process safety information is readily available to all employees. Material Safety Data Sheets include information on chemical properties and hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment. Other technical documents contain information on equipment design, operating temperature and pressure limts, and materials of construction. The information, in combination with written operating procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process changes from the safety point of view.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe Red River Mill primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to systematically evaluate process hazards. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and determines accident prevention and mitigation measures. Implementation of mitigation options in response to process hazards analyses is prioritized based on the relative risk rating assigned by the team.\n\nTo help ensure that the process hazards or controls do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the mill periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. Team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nWritten procedures are maintained that"

The procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.\n\nTRAINING\nThe Red River Mill has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training in mill operations, and all operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures. All training is documented, including the means to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nCONTRACTORS\nPrior to beginnning work, contractors are provided an orientation session that covers process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices. Contractor safety programs and safety performance are evaluated as criteria in the selection of contractors. \n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\nPre startup safety reviews are conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe basic components of the mechanical integrity program for the process include training, development of written procedures, inspections and tests, correction of equipment deficiencies when identified, and application of quality assurance measures. \nMaintenance personnel receive training in safe work practices to enable them to work safely.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nSafe work practices are in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
