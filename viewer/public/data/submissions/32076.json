      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Holyoke Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) is a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts.  The Holyoke WPCF occupies an approximately 11-acre facility located along the Connecticut River in the southeast portion of the city.\n\nThe Holyoke WPCF employs a gaseous chlorine system for wastewater disinfection and odor control. Because the quantity of chlorine stored on-site in a single process exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) provisions under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act Amendments (40 CFR Part 68), also known as the ?Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.?  Because chlorine is the only substance at the facility subject to Part 68, the Holyoke WPCF is subject to ?Program 2\" in the tiered RMP approach, since the facility is neither subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard (Massachusetts is a non-delegated OSHA state and has not adopted the federal OSHA Process Safety Management standard for state or local employees), nor is the facility in one of the nine SIC codes subject to ?Program 3.?\n\nChlorine gas is stored and fed from one-ton containers in the chlorine storage room inside the facility?s chlorine building.  Typically, 10 containers are present in the storage room.  Four containers can be connected to the chlorine feed system, while only 2 containers are ?on-line? at any given time.  Three chlorinators and related control equipment are used to feed chlorine to a chlorine contact basin for disinfection.  They include two 500 pound per day (ppd) chlorinators and a 1,000 ppd unit.  One of the 500 ppd units is available as a backup system to feed chlorine to the mixed sludge well for odor control.  The other two units can be used for feeding to the chlorine contact basin.  Vacuum regulators and an automatic switch-over valve are in line between the one-ton containers and the "

      "SummaryText": "chlorinators.\n\nThe chlorine gas is dissolved in plant water to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is fed to the two 200,000 gallon chlorine contact chambers where the disinfection process takes place. The control system is capable of manual control and automatic compound loop control.  Chlorine disinfection occurs from April 1 through October 15, as required by the facility?s discharge permit.  \n\nThe one-ton chlorine containers are delivered to the Holyoke WPCF by truck.  The chlorine containers are unloaded outside the chlorine building using an electric hoist.  The hoist lifts the containers from the truck and enters the chlorine storage room through an overhead door. The ?covered process? under this RMP includes chlorine storage, handling, and transfer activities prior to the introduction of chlorine into the chlorine contact basin or mixed sludge well.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Holyoke WPCF complies with accidental release prevention requirements for a Program 2 facility in accordance with 40 CFR 68. The facility?s chlorine storage, handling, and distribution system is designed and operated in accordance with state and local laws. Emergency response procedures for the Holyoke WPCF, including the chlorine storage and handling system, are described in the Holyoke WPCF Emergency Action Plan (revised 1/12/99), Emergency Response Plan (October 1998), Emergency Evacuation Procedure (revised May 2004), and Hazardous Material Emergency Response (revised May 2004) documents.  The Holyoke WPCF is a non-responding facility for incidents involving chlorine.  In general, outside responders and the local fire department are notified of all chlorine releases other than incidental releases that can be controlled at the time of the release (i.e., shutting a valve) by personnel in the immediate release area.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Holyoke WPCF chlorine storage, h"

The chlorine system is designed, installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with good engineering practice and industry-specific guidance developed by the Chlorine Institute, the Compressed Gas Association, and the Water Environment Federation.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nNo accidents involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place have occurred at the Holyoke WPCF in the five-year period prior to the re-submittal deadline of this plan (June 21, 1999 to June 21, 2004).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEmergency procedures described in the Holyoke WPCF Emergency Action Plan (revised 4/12/99), Emergency Response Plan (October 1998), Emergency Evacuation Procedure (revised May 2004), and Hazardous Material Emergency Response (revised May 2004) documents will be followed in the event of an emergency involving a chlorine release.  As a non-responding facility for incidents involving chlorine, the Holyoke WPCF will notify the local fire department and other outside emergency response agencies to respond to the emergency.  Copies of the above emergency response documents have been provided to the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to improve safety are proposed at this time.  In the event that privatization of the treatment plant operations occurs, the existing gaseous chlorine system will likely be replaced with a sodium hypochlorite system consistent with an alternatives evaluation study completed in January 1999.  A copy of the study is provided in Appendix A."
