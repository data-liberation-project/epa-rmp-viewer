Implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team.

All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  Upon completion of all recommendations for a specific PHA, a final report is issued that all affected employees can access, thus having knowledge that all the recommendations for the PHA have been resolved.

New employees receive basic training in operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  When new operators can demonstrate through tests or skills demonstration that they have the knowledge necessry to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they may be qualified for a job position and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators are updated when ever a process change occurs and are periodically given refresher training on the operating procedures.\r\n\r\nAdditional information, including responsibilities can be found in PSM-ADM-06 of the PSM administrative procedure and LPI-Billings Written Safety Plan.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nLPI-Billings uses contractors to supplement its workforce for peak production periods and for specialty work.  Procedures are in place to ensure contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their work place, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules and comply with all site specific safety requirements.  \r\n\r\nContractors are orientated on site safety and health hazards, task safety and health hazards, emergency response and evacuation information, and safe work practices for the site and their duties.\r\n\r\nPart of LPI-Billings' contractor program is a safety performance review of a contractor prior to hiring the contractor.

The provisions of the Contingency Pan are immediately implemented whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous material or hazardous waste which could harm personnel on the LPI-Billings site, endanger the neighboring community or cause damage to the environment.  Arrangements have been made with Lockwood Rural Fire District #8 to take the lead if an emergency occurred.  Other organizations that have agreed to respond in the event of an emergency are Yellowstone County Sheriff Department, Saint Vincent's Hospital and Health Center, Billings Clinic of Billings, Montana Department Of Environmental Quality, Montana State Disaster and Emergency Services Division, U.S. EPA (Region VIII, Montana Office), City of Billings Fire Department, U.R.S.Corp. and several local vendors. \r\n\r\nThe contingency and preparedness and prevention plans are accessible to all employees.  Every employee and contractor is familiarized with the plant alarm system, evacuation procedures and how to perform any assigned responsibility or duty.  Periodic evacuation drills are conducted to refresh workers on alarms and evacuation procedures.

Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the worst-case flammable endpoint is 0.30 miles.\r\n\r\nThe real life preventative measures which are not considered in the WCS evaluation are:\r\n       * DOT pressurized tank car specified for DMA transportation and handling \r\n       * Nitrogen purge preventing DMA vapor release to atmosphere and eliminating static air in the tank car\r\n       * Maintenance and inspection programs to monitor equipment integrity \r\n       * In-house operating and startup procedures\r\n       * Operators montor flow through automation system for quick response to process deviations\r\n       * Inventory minimization during non-DMA production periods\r\n       * Process has failclose valves before and after DMA pump and one at the blend vessel\r\n       * Manual shut-off of DMA system\r\nWith these practices in place, LPI-Billings considers the complete release of a full 25,000 gallon tank car to be a low probability.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO (ARS)\r\n\r\nThe alternate case scenario has been determined to be a compromise in a transfer line outside of the building between the railcar and the reacting vessel.  The largest potential loss of DMA would occur during a transfer which would be discovered and addressed within 10 minutes of the transfer startup.  Based off of the actual gpm transfer of 60% DMA over a 10 minute timeframe, the calculated amount of DMA that would potentially be released is 1295 lbs. or 188 gallons. The maximum distance to the flamable endpoint is 0.08 miles.  Accident pr"

Processes regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements applicable to RMP and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The administrative procedures used for process safety management have been revised to incorporate all RMP required items and these procedures are now considered PSM/RMP administrative procedures.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nLPI-Billings encourages employees to participate in plant safety.  PSM/RMP elements include employee participation through writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures, compiling process safety information and participating in process hazard analysis'.  Additionally, employee's have been instructed to come forward with their safety concerns.  Process' that fall under RMP requirements already are subject to PSM requirements.  Programs are in place that address both PSM and RMP regulations.  All PSM/RMP materials are available to employees.\r\n\r\nAdditional detail, including responsibilities, may be found in PSM-ADM-02 of the PSM administrative procedure.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATON (PSI)"
