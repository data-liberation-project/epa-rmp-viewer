The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nThe Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant is located approximately 3.5 miles southeast of Centrahoma, Oklahoma, on Highway 3 and operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n\n2. Condensate\n\n3. Residue Gas\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nAtlas treats the entire facility with three gas plants as one process.  Several vessels at each gas plant were evaluated for offsite consequence analyses.  There are two worst-case scenarios (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant.  The first "

The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.5 mile radius. The second scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 281,976 pounds (67,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in a natural gas liquid product surge tank at Stonewall.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.5 mile radius. The first vessel is located east of the second vessel causing different public receptors to be impacted in each release scenario. \n\n\n\nSince the plant is located in a populated area, the WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Atlas has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system that can divert all incoming gas to an emergency flare. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 92,612 pounds of the flammable mixture from the Natural Gas Liquids Product Surge Tank at the Stonewall Plant. The release would occur from valve failure leaving a two inch diameter opening in the bottom of the tank. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.4 miles, which includes offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. The release is expected to be isolated by plant personnel within 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to aid in accident release prevention.\n\n\n\nA.

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazard associated with the RMP covered scenario.  This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards.  The PHA is conducted using checklists with a team consisting of Atlas' employees who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience.  The team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified.  The team's findings are forwarded to Atlas and Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Management for resolution.  The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the scenario is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nAtlas maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.

Training\n\n\n\nThe Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands on observation specific to the plant operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

There have been no accidental release from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage during this period.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Coalgate Tupelo Stonewall Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Atlas staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before the"
