Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\t\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\t\r\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are required at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\t\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\t\r\nThe processes at the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\t\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\t\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant.

Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention / mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include; personnel training, safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation / operation / maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\r\n\t\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE COX CITY NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\t\r\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 9 miles east and 2 miles north of Rush Springs in Grady County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant regulated substances held above threshold quantities include pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane), condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) both comprised primarily of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons. The plant also utilizes HD-5 Propane for refrigeration(approx. 96% propane with small amounts of ethane and butanes), held in the process in excess of the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Cox City Plant follows applicable laws set forth in Occupational Safety and"

Under Program Level 3 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the C1+ mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 365,684 pounds (80% of the maximum tank capacity).  However, for Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory (100% maximum tank capacity of 457,105 pounds) of this tank is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.62 miles (3,265 feet).  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the WCS for the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant.\r\n\t\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Cox City gas plant is a VCE resulting from a release of 8,325 pounds of C1+ mixture over a sixty (60) minute period, resulting from a seal failure at the stabilizer feed pumps.  The hypothetical release is expected to be isolated by an operator in less than sixty minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.16 miles or 859 feet.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\r\n\t\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\t\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Operations personnel also participate in the development and review of operating procedures, Process Safety Information (PSA), and training and mentoring of other personnel.\r\n\t\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\t\r\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis / configuration information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\t\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\t\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\t\r\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
