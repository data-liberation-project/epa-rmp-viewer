All KRG facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner.  It shall be the responsibility of the General Manager to ensure that all procedures are followed.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is KRG's policy to immediately call the local fire department and assist this agency.\n\nIt is also KRG's belief and policy to work openly with all local, state, and federal agencies for the betterment of the community and the industry.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nKern Ridge Growers, LLC Lamont, is a carrot grower, packer, processor, and shipper located at 8005 Wharton Avenue, Lamont, California, that uses anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop refrigerating system and gaseous chlorine.  This facility was purchased in June of 1998 and is currently being remodeled, including  the ammonia and chlorine systems.  The refrigerant charge is 2160 pounds.  The chlorine is stored onsite with two, one ton tanks charging the Fresh Production with chlorine gas.  The gas is mixed with water and acts as a sanitizer.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nFor this document, two (2) separate ammonia release scenerios are used:  the \"Worst Case\" as required by law and the \"Alternative Release\" (most likely).  The Worst Case release scenario was based on a one ton tank completely filled, discharging 200 pounds per minute for a period of 10 minutes.  Distance to the end point is 3.5 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario was identified through the What-If Study performed on June 4, 1999 at the Cal ARP/RMP class held at the Kern County Fire Department instructed by Howard Wines, III.  In an unlikely event of a release, the gas / vapor would be discharged to the atmosphere.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program:\nThe following prog"

In July of 1998, KRG began remodeling the ammonia system.  In October of 1998, KRG evacuated the ammonia system.  An estimated 20 pounds of ammonia was accidentally released to the atmosphere.  This release was due to a leaking valve.  There were no offsite injuries or evacuation of the surrounding community.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nKRG's Emergency Action Public Notification is simply going door-to-door to alert the residents.\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\nCurrently, the safety changes taking place at KRG is management training in RMP conducted by Refrigerating Engineers & Technicians Association, Kern Chapter, and implementation of safety procedures."
