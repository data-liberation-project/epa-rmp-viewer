      "SummaryText": "New American Tec has developed a very detailed emergency responce program. New American Tec has worked with the local emergency planning committee. Our system is checked routinely in order to stay ahead of any accidental release. Also the system is constantly monitored to prevent any accidental release. New American Tec has not existed for five years but in the years that New American tec has existed there has been no accident of any kind. New American Tec has a perpetual safety program. Any necessary additions to this program are implemented immediately. Based on the tables and the assumptions of these tables that were supplied by the Environmental Protection Agency a worst case scenario would involve around five hundred people. The alternative release scenario would not involve any civillian residences at all and thereby effect no people. Any release would take place inside of a building. Routine maintenance and constant monitoring are used for mitigation. The end point distances for the worst case scenario and for the alternative release scenario are nine point four miles and three miles respectively. These distances are based on unreal circumstances and the fact that the chemical compund that we use has a half life of only one minute in has been ignored. Also ignored is the fact that the chemical compound that we use is pyrophoric and that upon contact with the atmosphere it ignites and destroys itself. The highly hazardous substance that we use at this facility and puts us in the risk management plan is nickel carbonyl. The following is a description of the hazards, their causes, their consequences, the recommendations and the dates that the recommendations were implemented. The first identified hazard is that of a liquid compound exiting the process. This might be caused by a pressure relief valve being lodged in the open position. The consequences of this would be liquid flowing to the thermal oxidizer where it would be destroyed. The recommendation was to in"

      "SummaryText": "stall a flow indicator which was accomplished in July of 1997. The second identified hazard was an over pressure in the plating chamber. This could be caused by the exhaust line being blocked. The consequences could be a leak through the chamber seal. The recommendations were to install an over pressure alarm and a pressure relief system both of which were installed in July of 1997. The next hazard that was identified is a possible over pressure of the entire system. This might be caused by the activation of the emergency shut off system. The consequences of this would be the activation of the pressure relief valves which of course are on a separate exhaust line. The recommendation was to evaluate the consequences of the emergency shut off systme activation at each  pressure relief location. These evaluations were completed in July of 1997. The next hazard that was identified is a possible expolsive mixture inside of the chamber. This could be cause by inadequate purging during the start up procedure. The consequence of this are more than obvious. The recommendation was to highlight this step in the operating procedures andto make sure that the opertor understands completely. The next hazard that was identified is a possible contamination of the supplied breathing air. The cause of this was assumed to be some undetected release. The consequences would be an exposure to anyone that was using the breathing air system. The recommendation was to add a monitor to the breathing air supply system. This monitor was added in August of 1997. The next hazard that was identified was determined to be incorrect operation of the system from improper labeling. The consequences can vary with the circumstances. The recommendation was to properly label all components and to make sure that the operator understands the system. Fire was not identified as a possible hazard but the chemical compound that New American Tec uses is pyrophoric. New American Tec has installed a very good fire s"
