This commitment is enforced and monitored through periodic inspections and meetings at the facility. Our safety policy is to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities. This policy is administered through a safety program which includes chlorine safety, forklift safety, lockout / tagout, employee safety trainings, manufacturers and documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses Chlorine on washing step to disinfect and preserve fresh marketable potatoes (June-October)\n\n\n\nChlorine Gas is stored in 1 ton container; it is liquefied by pressure and distributed to a pre-washing tank and to three washers thru a vacuum eductor. The facility stores usually no more than 1 full container (with 2,000 lbs.)and One empty container. Containers are stored in a safe and locked area.  \n\n\n\nIt is recommended to have between 100 to 200 ppm of available chlorine for potatoes when applied by spray with a contact time of 5-30 sec. Chlorine levels are monitored and recorded every 2-3 hours.\n\n\n\nDelta Farms Packing, Inc., has not had any re-portable chlorine releases during the past 5 years (June 2011 - June 2016). No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the water chlorination process.\n\n\n\n"
