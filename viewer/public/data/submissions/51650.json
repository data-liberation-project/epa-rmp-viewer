Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Plant is a newly constructed facility; therefore, it has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\nThe Plant is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) since it is an unmanned facility.  However, the facility is visited on a daily basis by facility?s personnel to ensure that proper operation and maintenance is performed at the facility.  Since public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant, the Plant is subject to Program 2 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\nThe following information serves as the 2008 RMP submission for the Plant.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \n\nThe Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordi"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane.  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 121,288 gallons (595,165 lbs).  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL.  The Plant?s Prevention Program 2 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart C, are included in the facility?s Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP), which is kept on-site as a separate document.  Required elements include: \n\n?Safety Information\n?Hazard Review\n?Operating Procedures\n?Training\n?Maintenance\n?Compliance Audits\n?Incident Investigation\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\nThe Plant is a newly constructed facility.  For this reason, no accidental releases of NGL occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to May 2008.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained.  Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Harrison County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)"

The Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
