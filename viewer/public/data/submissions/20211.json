      "SummaryText": "     Woodgate Petroleum Co., Inc. is a wholesale distribution facility for propane.  Woodgate receives propane by way of rail, unloads the propane, and then provides propane loading services for transport (tractor-trailer) trucks.  The facility consists of 13 above-ground storage tanks, a 12 spot tank-car unloading rack, and a total of 4 loading stations for trucks.\n     This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Stephens City, VA fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n     Our worst-case scenario is the failure of our largest tank, a 47,400-gallon tank filled to the greatest amount allowed(88% @ 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4mi.  The worst case scenario could affect 8 residences.\n     This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n     Woodgate Petroleum Co., Inc. has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage.\n     In the event of an emergency involving our propane facility, it is our policy to notify the Stephens City, VA fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. Members of the fire department have inspected our facility during training seminars."
