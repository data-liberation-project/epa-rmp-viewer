All employees at DVWTP are trained in chlorine\n     containment procedures and all are trained in the use of SCBA equipment.\n\n     2.   TYPES OF EMERGENCY\n\n               a.   Chlorine Release\n          \n          In the event of an equipment or human failure, potential sources for chlorine releases are:\n\n                         1.   One Ton chlorine Container\n                         2.   Chlorine supply lines and chlorination equipment.\n                    \n          At this facility, the loss of any utilities including electricity will not increase the potential\n     for a chlorine release.\n\n     3.   SCOPE\n          \n          The scope of this plan includes:\n\n               a.   A chlorine release contained within the plant facilities and controllable  by\n          CUWCD personnel and equipment.\n          \n               b.   A chlorine release affecting or with the potential to affect the area surrounding the\n          CUWCD; such a release would require outside assistance.\n\n     4.   PLANNING FOR HANDLING THE EMERGENCY\n\n          Responsibility:\n\n          The Plant Manager is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the plan.

Do not give \"off the record\" comments.\n\n     4.8  Shelter/Evacuation\n\n          Even though this facility will be working closely with the LEPC, Fire Department, and\n     other emergency officials, a decision regarding whether to evacuate or to shelter affected\n     outside persons is a difficult one. Generally for us, a significant chlorine release is likely\n     to last for up to one hour before it is contained.\n\n          Therefore, sheltering in place is the normal mode to be utilized during an emergency. \n     While it is unlikely that this facility could have a chlorine release requiring evacuation,\n     nevertheless, we must be prepared for such an eventually.  If it is anticipated that a release\n     cannot be soon contained or is of a massive quantity, the evacuation option should be\n     utilized.  Call 911 and suggest that sheltering of residences within (indicate immediate area\n     or more as needed) and evacuation of others be implemented.  \n\n          4.8.1     Neighboring Residences and Facilities.\n\n          State Park Recreation area and one family on the back road up to the plant.\n\n           A prolonged significant release probably would affect an area beyond the neighboring\n     residencies and facilities of up to1.5 mile radius from the plant.  This would affect\n     approximately1 resident and many recreational transit persons in the area. Many factors\n     such as wind speed, wind direction, weather conditions, and time of day would affect the\n     extent of the area.  \n\n          4.8.2     Responsibility\n\n          These duties are the responsibility of the overall emergency coordinator.
