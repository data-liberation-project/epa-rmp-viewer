      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert A. Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWDSC has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\r\n\r\nSkinner Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and t"

The CCHF, which is equipped with two chlorine vapor scrubbing systems, was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  \r\n\r\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the Chlorine System at the Skinner Plant.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.  The Skinner Plant has a good safety record of chlorine use.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\n\r\nThe Robert A. Skinner Water Treatment Plant (Skinner Plant) is located at 33740 Borel Road in Winchester, California.  The plant is situated northeast of the I-15 and 215-freeway junction.  The facility was constructed in 1976 and covers 345 acres adjacent to Lake Skinner.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facili"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\r\n\r\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\r\n\r\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

On February 2009, an incident occurred resulting in a minor release of chlorine gas from the Chlorine System.  The release occurred due to an insufficient seal between the gas angle valve and the manway cover plate on the chlorine cargo trailer.  An employee was exposed to chlorine gas as a result of the release.  The employee was not wearing proper PPE during the operation, which is required by safety policies and the operating procedures.  After initial advanced first aid from emergency responders, the employee was transported to the hospital for observation and was released after several hours with minor work restrictions.  Skinner employees and responding agencies worked in conjunction to tighten the valve and stop the release.  The release was within containment and there were no offsite impacts."
