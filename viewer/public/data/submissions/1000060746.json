This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Winona propane terminal located in Coconino County, Arizona is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC, and is operated by Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Winona Propane terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility.  The facility receives odorized propane LPG by rail car and stores the liquid in one of three above ground pressurized storage tanks.   A propane vapor compressor is used to provide pressurized vapors into the vapor space for the unloading of rail cars spotted on the facility rail siding.  The same compressor is subsequently used to remove vapors from the empty cars prior to their disconnection from the tank fill piping and railcar unloading racks.  Odorized propane stored in the three above-ground propane storage bullets is transferred to 18-wheel propane tanker trucks through the use of a small liquid propane pump.  The terminal operator is responsible for the hookup, unloading and disconnection of supply rail cars.  The operator also assists with the proper tare weighing, loading and full weighing of transport trucks that fill up at the terminal, and with coordinating the removal of empty rail cars and the delivery of full cars as the propane"
