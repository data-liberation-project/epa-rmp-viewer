One or more materials are regulated and listed in 40 CFR Table 1 to 68.130 (List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention).\n\nOff-site consequences of release of material was evaluated using  RMP *Comp, Version 1.07, modeling software developed by the US EPAs Office of Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention, NOAA's Hazardous Materials Response Division in conjunction with the Bureau of Census, US Department of Commerce.  The Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint was determined to be 1.0 miles.  The area within the 1.0 mile radius was plotted using Marplot (also available from the US EPA) to determine the risk posed to off-site areas.\n\nThe population within the 1.0 mile radius was estimated using Landview 6 software based on the 2000 census available from the United States Department of Commerce, US Census Bureau.  According to the estimation, there are 73 housing units with a total population of 188 people in census block points located within or touching the circle defined by the radius of the Toxic Endpoint.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was calculated similarly.  The Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint was calculated using RMP* Comp resulting in a radius of 0.2 miles. \n\nUpdated June 2008\n\n"
