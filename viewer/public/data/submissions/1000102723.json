The regulated substance under the RMP program is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (also known as denaturant).\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results yielded a 0.8 mile radius, and is provided as part of the backup documentation maintained onsite. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth and Bing, as well as the facility\u2019s knowledge of nearby residences. No environmental receptors are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant.\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\n1. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1.0 pounds per square inch (psi), a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility are not limited to regular business hours but occur with a facility staff member in the control room overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.

Ringneck began operations at the facility in April 2019. There has been no change in management since the start of operations.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\nRingneck has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nRingneck has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nRingneck\u2019s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Ringneck is Mike Stanley, Plant Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individual (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) assists the Plant Manager with RMP and spill response coordination:\n\nAaron Trabing, EHS Manager\nWork: 605.945.6987\n24-Hour: 307.851.6498\n\u2003\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Ringneck ethanol plant is located in Onida, Sully County, South Dakota.
