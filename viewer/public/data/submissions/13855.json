Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenanc"

The Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is located at 5403 Hillmont Avenue in Eagle Rock, next to the Ventura Freeway.  This facility serves to chlorinate the reservoir, one inlet line, and two discharge lines.  The water serves the northern and eastern Los Angeles area. The station consists of a chlorination room and a pump room.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. A maximum of seven one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet chlorine building.  Six of these chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and one is stored as a spare. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station at any given t"

It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nIn normal operations, four chlorine 1-ton containers are manifolded together in two banks of two containers to supply chlorine.  These four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The primary bank is connected to the liquid header and the secondary bank is connected to the gas header.  The gas supplying containers bypass the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry or the evaporator shuts down due to a low temperature condition.  Connections are provided, without Halogen actuators, for two additional ton containers.  These two containers have automatic shutoff valves in the piping system immediately downstream of the pigtail connections.  Space is allocated in the room for the storage of one additional container that is not provided with a connection to the chlorination system.  \n\nThe liquid chlorine passes from the containers to the evaporator where it is vaporized in a water bath.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to one of the three chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine. \n\nThe gaseous chlorine is pulled by vacuum from the chlorinators to injectors where it is dissolved into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  For reservoir treatment, the injector is located on the shore next to the reservoir.  For the two discharge lines, the injectors are located inside the chlorinators.  The concen"

The treated water is then piped into the distribution network. \n\nResidual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine in the pipeline downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent chlorine dosing.  Dosing is also controlled in response to flowrate.   \n\nA chlorine leak detector with multiple sensors has been installed inside the building which alarms locally as well as at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar. \n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Loss of power will cause the emergency generator to take over powering station controls.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).

The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere was defined to be 200 lbs./min.  No passive mitigation systems were considered in determining the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere. \n\nEPA and CalARP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine cloud formed during the worst-case release scenario would be denser-than-air, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling analysis.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (1130F), and average humidity (61%) were used for the dispersion modeling analysis.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the worst-case scenario has offsite impacts. \n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and conta"

Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the hazard review.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there was one chlorine release, which resulted in offsite (outside the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  The accident at this facility on October 21, 1997, resulted in the release of chlorine from the chlorinator vent, venting chlorine outside the building.  However, this scenario was not selected as an alternative release scenario because the chlorinator vent now vents inside the building (it used to vent outside the building).  The change would reduce the toxic endpoint distance for the chlorinator vent release scenario.\n\nThe scenario selected for the Eagle Rock Chlorination Station involves the release of liquid chlorine from a crack in one of the pigtails connecting the third container in a bank to the chlorination process.  This container is not equipped with the Halogen actuator and a leak in the pigtail will allow the 1-ton containers to leak.  This scenario can occur if the operator uses a pigtail, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the pigtail during the withdrawal of chlorine from the ton container.  It is assumed that the crack developed in 1/4 inch diameter pigtail corresponds to a hole of 0.0625-inch (1/16-inch) diameter. The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.  At a concentration of 10 ppm, the Halogen actuators close the angle valves on the other four containers.  It is assumed that approximately 60 minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond.  One passive miti"

Two active mitigation systems considered were the actuation of a chlorine detector and the actuation of the Halogen shut-off valves installed on the ton containers.  The amount of chlorine released inside the building is 492 lbs, at an average rate over one hour of 8.2 lb/min.\n\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint was also estimated using the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3ppm.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.

The hazard review was performed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the chlorine handling system.  A number of equipment and procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended actions.  All the above recommendations have been evaluated by the DWP.  In addition, a pressurized liquid chlorine system has been added and four Halogen actuators are mounted on the ton containers.  Additional 20 changes to further improve chlorine safety were identified in April 1999, when the hazard review was completed for the facility.  It is expected that these recommendations will be evaluated by December 1999.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorination system."
