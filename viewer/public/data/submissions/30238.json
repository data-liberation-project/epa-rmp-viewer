This operation was replaced with a new production line for manufacturing frozen breads.  These changes resulted in some ammonia refrigeration equipment being removed and some new ammoina refrigeration equipment being installed.  The capacity charge of ammonia refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration system increased from 13,000 pounds to 15,000 pounds.  The Process Safety Management program was used to manage this change to the ammonia refrigeration system, a Process Safety Hazard Analysis was conducted on the new equpiment, a review of the Process Hazard Analysis on the existing equipment was completed, Standard Operating Procedures were reviewed, and training conducted.  The new bread production line was started into production on March 15, 2004.  The Chaska plant now operates two frozen bread dough production lines at this facility."
