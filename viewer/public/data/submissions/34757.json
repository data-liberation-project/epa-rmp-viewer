This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. El Paso Field Services Management\u00bfs (El Paso\u00bfs) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances; however, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release and emergency personnel (when appropriate) will respond to ensure the safety of our employees and the public. \n\nThe Almeda Facility, located at 11650 Almeda Road, Houston, Texas in Harris County, is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fractionation plant with LPG processing, storage, and transportation.  This liquid product contains propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane, which are regulated flammable substances. In order to establish as safe of an environment as possible for employees and the public, El Paso has elected to maintain minimum inventories (well below the threshold quantity) of toxic substances. \n\nThe Worst Case Scenarios (WCS) at the Almeda Facility involve catastrophic releases from two different storage wells.  These two release scenarios have the potential to affect different land areas and different public receptors.  The first WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the release of 2,150,000 lbs of isobutane from a storage well. The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 1.0 mile. Although El Paso has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credits for passive and/or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\nTh"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. In addition, the gas plant maintains a Cause and Effect Diagram that provides information on how each of the process equipment will react to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\nTraining \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator works with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintai"

Once again, although El Paso has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credits for passive and/or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from a 10-minute release of flammable mixture from a rupture of the four-inch pipe that feeds the LPG loading rack, releasing a total of 7,182 pounds of flammable mixture.  The maximum distance to the 1- psi over pressure endpoint for this event is 0.10 mile. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\nAll safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15-month intervals.  The tests are conducted as a part of the mechanical integrity element of El Paso\u00bfs PSM program, which has been in place for several years.\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation they are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nEl Paso\u00bfs plant employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program and how the 14 elements of the PSM standard are being addressed is included in the PSM Policy and Implementation Plan which is maintained at the plant. In addition, the gas plant has initiatives under way that address process safety, and employee safety issues. These initiatives include individual safety awards presented for safety excellence during the previous year. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Almeda Facility has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Plant management is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is always readily available to the employees. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in a Cause & Effect Diagram. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe gas plant also maintains plant job books, piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID's) and Electrical Classification Drawings that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information, in combination with written procedures and training, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\nThe Almeda Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Almeda Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures may be necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) \n\nThe Almeda Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process- operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. All operators and/or effected employees must review, understand and sign the MOC (Form 703) prior to starting his/her shift. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\nIncident Investigation \n\nThe Almeda Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plan"

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. This information is communicated to other company employees in other plants by way of the PSM News Brief. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits \n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Almeda Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe processes at the Almeda Facility must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities \n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Almeda Facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\nSpecialized Safety Features \n\nThe Almeda Facility has safety features on many units to help: (1) quickly detect a release,"

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors \n\nThe Almeda Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished prior to beginning work by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices. In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance by use of the contract, or evaluation form to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nThe Almeda Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists (Form 736) to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the constr"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training in: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will take appropriate actions as to ensure safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices \n\nThe Almeda Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
