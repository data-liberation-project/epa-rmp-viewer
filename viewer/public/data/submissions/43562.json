      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response:\nThe Mittal Steel USA-Hennepin facility uses approximately 24 tons of liquefied chlorine annually for water treatment purposes. The chlorine is contained in one ton cylinders which are stored at three locations. Chlorine gas can be hazardous under various conditions and must be handled safely to reduce the threat of unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to members of the nearby community. It is the policy of Mittal Steel USA-Hennepin to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations.\n\nMittal Steel USA-Hennepin helps to ensure the safety of the community and its workforce by properly operating and maintaining the facility, use of safety devices inherent in the design of the processes (including alarms), and through proper training of personnel.\n\nThe facility emergency response program is written and includes an emergency action plan for chlorine releases. This plan is part of the off-site response plan on file with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Hennepin Fire Department in accordance with the provisions of the \"Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986\" (SARA Title III). These plans include procedures for notifying local emergency response agencies. \n\n2. The stationary sources and regulated substance:\nThe Mittal Steel USA-Hennepin facility processes hot rolled steel coils through several operations including a temper mill, tandem mill, pickle line, batch annealing, and a galvanize line. Some of the auxillary services which support the main operations are the roll shop, garage, and utility departments.\n\nIllinois River water is used at the facility for both contact and non-contact applications. Chlorine is used to treat water at three different locations within the facility:\n\nRiver Pump House - Four chlorine cylinders (4,000 lbs)\nWater Treatment Plant - Four chlorine cylinders (8,000 lbs)\nRecirculating Water Station - Four chlorine cylinders (4,000 lbs)\n\nThe cyl"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 43562,
      "SummaryText": "inders are connected into the process through a manifold system, valves and pressure regulators. Each of the three processes is checked at least once on a daily basis and each system has an alarm system which activates when chlorine levels exceed five parts per million near the process area.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternate release scenarios: \nWorst case scenario - Failure of a full one-ton cylinder of chlorine which would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a ten minute time period.\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point 0.0087 mg/L for this scenario is 3.0 miles.\n\nAlternative scenario - Rupture of the 3/8\" tubing leading from the chlorine cylinder to the manifold which would result in a release rate of eighteen and one-half pounds per minute over fifteen minutes.\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.0087 mg/L for this scenario is 0.2 miles.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has developed a Process Safety Management Plan for its chlorine processes as required by 29 CFR 1910.119 of the OSHA standards. Facility personnel are trained to respond in accordance with the provisions of the plan.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\nThere have been no releases from any of the chlorine processes within the last five years.\n\n6. The emergency response program:\nMittal Steel USA-Hennepin has established and implemented an emergency action plan for the entire facility. This Emergency Response Plan is on file with the Hennepin Fire Department and the Putnam County Local Emergency Committee.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\nMittal Steel USA-Hennepin constantly reviews its equipment, operating procedures, and personnel training and makes any changes necessary to improve safety and decrease risk promptly."
