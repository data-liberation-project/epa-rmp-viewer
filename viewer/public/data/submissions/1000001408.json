The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five year resubmission.  This facility has two refrigeration systems, tied together with a common transfer line, using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in these systems meets the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) threshold reporting quantity.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  Our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation\u00c2\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration department personnel\n\u00c2\u00bf Preventative maintenance program\n\u00c2\u00bf Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration department personnel\n\u00c2\u00bf Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n\u00c2\u00bf Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\u00c2\u00bf Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n\u00c2\u00bf Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n\u00c2\u00bf Regular review and update of process safety information\n\u00c2\u00bf Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n\u00c2\u00bf On site HAZMAT team\n\u00c2\u00bf Emergency Response and Action Plan\n\u00c2\u00bf Hot-work permit program and procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf Line Break procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf Contractor Safety program\n\nThe Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelin"

Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of air purifying respirators for the refrigeration department personnel, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, the Company performs periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Recommended actions to improve safety are identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for completion as required.  For this RMP submission, a new offsite consequence analysis was performed, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenarios\u00c2\u00bf."
