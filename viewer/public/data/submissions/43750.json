Red Star underlines its commitment to the environment, focusing on the limitation of nuisance and the prevention of ecological risks.  This policy had made it possible to acquire a level of expertise recognized internationally.  It has guided research and targeted investments, reinforcing its will to improve the quality of life for everyone: employees, clients, consumers, and area around its production sites.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The Red Star Yeast facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa manufactures yeast for sale to the baking and brewing industries and retail consumers.  Anyhdrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration process at the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has a total charge of 13,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nCHEMICAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, operating procedures and maintenance systems in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for anhydrous ammonia as part of the RMP requirements.  The facility has implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process.  The prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from the ammonia refrigeration process at the facility.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard review, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The facility was constructed in 2005 and has not incurred any accidents or injuries related to anhydrous ammonia d"
