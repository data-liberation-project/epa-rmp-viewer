Five-Year Release History:\nNo accidental releases of hazardous gases have occurred at any of the New Smyrna Beach Utilities Commission's facilities in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated and reviewed by the City of New Smyrna Beach Fire Department. This program includes an emergency response decision and notification plan designating them as the first responder for any chemical releases or other emergencies at the Waste Water Treatment Plant. Routine joint training scenarios have been held on-site with plant and fire rescue personnel simulating release scenarios and other related chemical emergencies.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral changes have resulted from the development and implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Most of these concerns were discovered while performing the process hazard assessment review and included:\n* Improved signage practices.\n* Installation of wind direction indicators at the plant entrance and storage locations.\n* Updating of maintenance/operation standard operating procedures.\n* Safe storage of hazardous gas containers.\n* Reduction of hazardous gas inventories.\n* Continued training on hazardous gas equipment and procedures."
