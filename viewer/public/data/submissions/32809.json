      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Wallace R. Knox Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 3901 Bay Street Extension in Texas City, Texas.  This facility treats the wastewaters collected from residential, commercial, institutional, and a limited number of industrial customers within the limits of Texas City.  The treatment plant falls within the Level 2 Risk Management Program requirements due to the storage and handling of chlorine above the threshold quantity of 2500 pounds.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for the treated wastewater prior to discharge.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe City of Texas City Utilities Department takes chemical safety and accident prevention very seriously.  The RMP program for the Wallace R. Knox WWTP is facilitated by the Director of Utilities, Wastewater Superintendent, division supervisory staff, and the division's safety officer.  These individuals share the commitment and responsibility to train the WWTP operators and maintenance personnel in the safe and proper handling of the chlorine and equipment, personal protective equipment, and safety procedures.  Chemical specific training is also provided during the training courses taken by the operators for their required State certifications.\n\nIn addition to training, the safety of our operations and maintenance staff is of paramount concern to the City of Texas City.  To those ends, policies and procedures are enforced to require a minimum of two operators being present when working around the chlorine cylinders in such a manner that an accidental release of the chlorine could occur (ie. changing out empty cylinders, performing maintenance on the chemical equipment, etc.).  All personnel working in such conditions are required to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment including self contained breathing apparatus and gloves.\n\nProtection of the community is another major concern for the City.  All chlorine cylinders and cont"

      "SummaryText": "rol equipment are housed in a masonry building which, in the event of an accidental release, could slow the migration of the chemical, thereby protecting our offsite customers as well as our onsite personnel.  Due to the fact that during the storage and handling of the chlorine the building may be open, it was not considered in impact calculations as a mitigating factor.  \n\nAir monitoring sensors are installed within the chlorine building which, via computer dial out programs, alert the facility operators, Police/Fire dispatchers, and supervisory personnel in the event of a chlorine release.  The sensitivity of the monitoring sensors is set at 3.0 ppm.  This low concentration sensitivity ensures quick activation of the emergency response system to any potentially harmful release of the chemical.  Weekly checks of the monitoring  and paging systems help assure all parties that the system is operational and will function in the event of an accidental release.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Wallace R. Knox WWTP is part of the Texas City-LaMarque LEPC Emergnency Response Plan.  In the event of an accidental release, the monitoring system within the chlorine building will alert the Police/Fire dispatchers who then notify the Texas City Fire Department's Haz Mat unit.  Ranking City officials are also alerted to the chemical release.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Fire Department's Haz Mat unit to contain, control and eliminate the cause of the chemical release.  The Fire Department also controls the scene and response levels to the chemical release.\n\nThe personnel of the WWTP are nonrespondants during such a major release and only provide technical support to the Fire Department Haz Mat unit as needed.\n\nWhen necessary and as indicated by the ranking fire official at the scene, the the community's public alert system would be activated to inform the citizens of the level of emergency and the steps that they should take to avoid injury.  Many forms of alerting the pub"

Knox Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of Chlorine within the last five years which fall within the guidelines set forth in 40 CFR 68.42(a)."
