These procedures cover normal startup, startup after turnaround, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown.  In addition, the procedures list operating limits, consequence of deviations and responses, safety and health concerns and  safety systems.  Kripple Kreek Gas Plant uses these procedures for reference by experienced personnel and to provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\r\n\r\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MOC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\r\n\t\r\n\tTraining\r\n\tTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New operational employees receive training on the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant's Operating Procedures, and basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 ye"

Since the scope of these two programs encompass much of the same material, we have presented the pertinent information following the outline established in the PSM program.\r\n\t\r\n\tEmployee Participation\r\n\tEmployee participation is mandated by the corporate PSM manual.  In response to this mandate the Kripple Kreek Gas Plant has:\r\n 1.  Created a matrix of required employee participation.\r\n 2.  Posted information for employee participation in the Control Room.\r\n 3.  Reported the finding for PHAs, Compliance Audits and incident investigations during regularly   scheduled Safety Meetings.\r\n 4.  Directly involved employees in the establishment of maintenance and operating procedures.\r\n 5.  Sought input for training, both in subject matter and timing from employees.\r\n 6.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nEOG Resources, Inc.\r\nKripple Kreek Gas Plant\r\n\t\r\n\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\tEOG Resources has a longstanding commitment to public welfare and worker safety.  EOG addresses accidental release prevention through four factors:  design, training, operating parameters and regular maintenance.  Through design efforts, we have limited the public exposure.  Through training, we have prepared our personnel to respond effectively.  Limiting the operating parameters reduces the stress on process equipment.  And regular maintenance serves to prolong equipment life as well as discover potential problems before they become a safety issue.\r\n\r\nShould an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, EOG personnel will evaluate the  conditions, take actions within their capabilities to minimize the risk and notify the appropriate outside agencies.\r\n\t\r\n\tFACILITY BACKGROUND INFORMATION\r\n\tThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant facility is a natural gas processing facility which includes fixed and skid mounted natural gas processing equipment and natural gas liquids storage tanks. The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including: propane, butane, ethane, methane, pentane, isobutene [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Isopentane [Propane, 2-methyl-]. These substances are listed in Tables 3-41 of the 40 CFR 68.130. This installation does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68.1302.\r\n\r\nMarplot indicates that there are no public and no environmental receptors within the 0.3 mile radius endpoint. There is one potential residential and two potential public receptors marginally beyond the 0.3 mile radius endpoint. These potential public receptors are one housing unit and two office buildings located:\r\n\r\n 1. East at 1,775' (office buildings), and \r\n 2. Southeast at 2,219' (housing unit).  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no public receptors within the area of the alternate release scenar"
