California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1    SUNVIEW COLD STORAGE - PETERSON SOUTH FACILITY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                                Process Chemical    Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nP1 - Ammonia Refrigeration               Ammonia            50,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.

Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2.    Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage (Peterson South) is a cold storage facility for table grapes.  The facility has an ammonia process that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple multiple cold storage rooms, and a sulfur-dioxide process for table grape fumigation.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system utilizes flooded refrigeration design and operate as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each evaporator where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the compressors  which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. \n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single pro"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nSunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emerge"

Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage - Peterson South Facility has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and docu"
