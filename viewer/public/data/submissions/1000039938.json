The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule requires Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\r\n \r\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the ch"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\r\n\r\nThe Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility Disinfection Process is required by state law, to implement a Program Level 3 Prevention Program which is similar to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Disinfection Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\r\n\r\n4.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\r\n\r\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\r\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\r\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\r\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\r\n* specific chemical inventories.\r\n \r\nThe Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility ensures that the process safety information is available to all Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.

The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Disinfection Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the EHS Committee and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Muncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Disinfection Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the EHS Committee for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n4.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nMuncie Sanitary District Water Pollution Control Facility engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Disinfection Process operation should be safely performed.
