Emphasis will be placed on managing the higher risk areas of our facilities first, the priority of which will be established by each facility team.\n\n\nStatement of the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery\nThe Management of STRC recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both the refinery and the local community.  Our policy is to ensure that our efforts with prevention-through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance, and communication with our neighbors-will help us prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and mitigate the release.\n\n\nDefinition of Processes and Regulated Substances\nSTRC operates a variety of petroleum refining process to produce propane, propylene, butanes, butylene, gasolines, kerosene, diesel fuels and asphalt.  These processes include: atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, reforming, fluidized catalytic cracking, alkylation, and associated supporting operations such as crude unloading, sulfur recovery, product blending, storage and product loading.  The NAICS code for STRC is 32411 and must meet the requirements of Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program Level 3.\n\nThe RMP rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process\" (re: 40 CFR 68.3).\n\nPer the RMP definition, STRC has the following RMP regulated flammables in its processes:\n\n* Hydrogen\n* Pentane\n* Butane\n* Isobutane\n* Butene\n* Propane\n* Propene\n* Ethane\n* Ethylene\n* Methane\n\n"

However, STRC have prevention and safety programs in place for all Hydrogen Sulfide handling units as part of our PSM Program. \n\nThe handling of all RMP flammable and toxic substances, regardless of quantity on-site, is performed in a manner consistent with the RMP general duty clause.  \n\nBased upon threshold quantities and process definition, STRC is reporting the following processes in its RMP:\n\n-    The Butane Spheres:    A flammable mixture containing primarily isobutane, butane, 1-butene, propane, pentane, isopentane, 1-pentene and propylene.

While releases have been documented, none of these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, STRC investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems. \n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSTRC has instituted and maintains a process safety management (PSM) program for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  While the following sections are required and practiced for PSM, STRC has other programs and practices (i.e. lock out/tag out, etc.) which add to the operational safety of the refinery.\n\nEmployees participate in all aspects of PSM by being members of the process hazard analysis team for new installations or procedures, members of the prestartup safety review team and being a member of incident investigations.  Employees participate in development and review of operating procedures and by suggesting and becoming knowledgeable of changes in their respective areas of responsibilities (management of change).  Process safety information, Material Safety Data Sheets and mechanical equipment data is available to all employees.  Employees are trained and refreshed on the use of hot work permits (as well as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment, line opening and blinding, control of entrance/exit of units, Hazmat and emergency response, etc.).\n\nProcess safety information is provided in many forms.  A hazards communication program and laboratory chemical hygiene plan informs employees and contractors of the chemical hazards to which they may be exposed and the measures that need to be taken to protect them.

This structured approach uses process parameters such as flow, temperature, pressure, etc. to examine impact of deviations.  These analyses produce recommendations for controls or changes.  New facilities are subjected to this analysis before operation.\n\nWritten operating procedures are in place to provide clear instruction for all aspects of operations of the refinery.  These procedures cover any type of operation on each unit, including anything from normal operation to startup procedures to emergency shutdown to partial operation of a unit.\n\nTraining is provided to all operations employees covering their job functions working on the process units.  Initial training requires a program of classroom and on-the-job training which takes a four-step progression of levels of certification.  A written and/or performance test is given at completion of the four levels and progression to the next level cannot take place without the approval of the supervisor and the Operations Manager.  Beyond the initial training, refresher training is continually provided which allows recertification of all operators every three years.\n\nContractor's safety is monitored.

This constitutes a final checklist for the process prior to startup.  The review ensures that all safety considerations have been built and are operable before the unit actually starts. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nSTRC has written an Emergency Response Plan to set in action if an emergency takes place.  The refinery has its own Emergency Response Team that can respond to any Fire, Rescue, Spill or Vapor Release.  The Emergency Response Team receives specialized training enabling them to handle industrial type emergencies.  The Emergency Response Team can respond 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.  If an emergency should occur the Refinery operates under the Incident Command type system along with having its own 800 MHZ two-way radio that is programmed to the Local Emeregency Planning Committee (e.g. Fire Department) radio frequency.  With these two items in place the refinery can establish quick communication with the Fire Department for aid and public notification if the emergency warrants.  In addition the Fire Department is given periodic walk through tours of the refinery to familiarize themselves with the specific areas of the plant along with reviewing the different types of emergency equipment the refinery has and its location.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSTRC has instituted the following items to improve safety for its employees and community:\n* Removed chlorine from its water treating system and replaced it with a much safer substitute.\n* Installed excessive vibration monitors and emergency shutdowns on critical process unit pumps.\n* Purchased a Pierce Foam pumper Industrial Fire Truc"
