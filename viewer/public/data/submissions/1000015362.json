The safe management of chemical products is considered priority to minimize the risk to our community, environment and personnel.\n\nAdditionally, Industrial Chemicals Inc. manages the facility in compliance with all Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Georgia Environmental Protection Division and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations.\n\nTo ensure the facility continues to operate in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with all regulations, an extensive risk management system has been developed and integrated into our operating procedures.\n\nSignificant components of the system include training, operating procedures for chemical handling, inspection, maintenance, emergency response and incident management. These procedures provided to responsible personnel and management's continual compliance oversight ensures safe chemical management.\n\nThe Compliance Department and Facility Manager are designated as having the primary responsibility of ensuring the plan and all components are implemented.\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is used for receipt, packaging, storage and distribution of chemical products. There are no manufacturing activities conducted at the site.\n\nBoth liquid and dry chemicals are received in small packages and placed in storage for shipment to industrial customers. These prepackaged containers include portable tanks, cylinders and drums.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe product is delivered to the facility on transportation units speci"

It is important to recognize, however, that the regulations require the identification of the potentially impacted population using a circle with a radius that is the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint. In reality, the released material would most likely take the form of a cloud or plume, impacting only a portion of the circle located in the downwind direction from the source.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon employee training, chemical safety awareness, equipment and facility management.\n\nTraining includes both the classroom environment and observation by management to verify competency. Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period and knowledge is determined by verbal and written test. Management follows a yearly schedule issuing course work on a weekly basis to the facility manager. Classes are held at the facility on a weekly basis for one to two hours.
