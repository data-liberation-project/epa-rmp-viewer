      "SummaryText": "Jensen-Souders is a warehouse for chemicals. We do no mixing or filling. We have a room that was made for flammable storage(H2 room) and a H3 room for combustibles. We are one of three warehouses that are  approved by National Association of Chemical Distributors(NACD) affilate Program for Chemical Handles.\nNACD had an on-site auditing group go over all of our programs. This day long process took two weeks for us to comply with their requests for compliance.  We received our Responsible Distribution Process(RDP ) verification in March 2007. We have been doing Sara reports for since 1995. We have 14 different training programs for our employees. \nWe never had a spill or fire. This is due to management watching over the training programs and we look for situations that could cause harm or fire in the warehouse. The warehouse manager and the owner walk through the warehouse every Tuesday and Thursday with all phone calls on hold.\nThe risk to the community is fire.  We have every fire person tour our building and every year we have one or two fire  drills that has the fire trucks and men on site. We do not store any explosives. We have a security system with motion detectors and are planning on cameras to be added. Our security is very tight and each employee has an eye on strangers without badges. We have four J.J. Keller 3 ring manuals that are updated by them.(Hazardous Material Compliance, Hazard Material Regulations, OSHA Compliance Manual and 1910 OSHA guide. \nTHE STRENGTH OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS IT IS STRONGLY ENFORCED BY MANAGEMENT\nI would consider it a honor to have an EPA person visit us any time and no appointment."
