GPC II will employ these measures to ensure that the means for preventing a catastrophic release, fire, or explosion are understood and to ensure the necessary preventative measures and lines of defense are installed and maintained. Every person on-site is included in these measures and management will ensure they are properly established and utilized.\n\nB.\tStationary Source & Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGPC II is located in Daviess County, Indiana. The facility is a corn wet miller producing beverage and denatured alcohols, animal feed, starches, and corn syrup solids. GPC's facilities reside on 800 acres and include storage tanks and processes typical of a corn wet milling plant.\n\nB.1\tPrimary Plant Operations of Concern\n* Railcar and tank truck unloading areas.\n* Ethylene Oxide storage and transfer systems.\n* Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) (SO2) unloading, storage and transfer system.\n\nB.2\tUse of Regulated Substances\nEthylene Oxide\n* Used in the process to produce various starches.\n* A minimum inventory of zero is handled or stored at the facility.\n* A maximum inventory of 243,200 pounds (lbs) is handled or stored at the facility.\n\nSO2\n* Used in the corn steeping process.\n* A minimum inventory of 16,850 lbs is handled or stored at the facility.\n* A maximum inventory of 231,308 lbs is handled or stored at the facility.\n\nC.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at GPC II include but are not limited to:\n* All elements of"

Within the completed PHAs, critical processes and mitigation systems to ensure safety systems are maintained for regulated chemicals. Policies and procedures are set forth in GPC's corporate safety and PSM manuals outlining everyday and emergency procedures. Based on the findings and recommended actions of the PHAs, changes to improve safety will be implemented as deemed necessary.\n\nD.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nThe GPC II facility has had no reportable accidents for the regulated chemicals in the previous five years.\n\nE.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is coordinated with the City of Washington's Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)."
