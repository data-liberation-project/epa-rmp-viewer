During this time,there has been no change to the amount of ammonia in the system.  There have been no catastrophic events, and no small releases of ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThis facility is a cold storage and fruit packing warehouse located outside the City of Chelan, Chelan County, State of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used as a refrigerant.  There is approximately 21,500 lbs of ammonia in the facility, based on receipts for ammonia purchased.\n\n\n\nThe facility's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and practices.  It is the policy of management to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.  The prevention plan meets all the requirements of OSHA's PSM (Process Safety Management) regulations.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration personnel do not respond to large ammonia releases and have not received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1920.120.  Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release, if possible.  If not possible, they will evacuate.   Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate.  The Fire Department or Hazmat Team will take control of the incident upon arrival at the plant.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous substance list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n   P"

The largest vessel will hold 31,353 lbs of ammonia, however it will never be filled to capacity but rather up to 80% of capacity (25,478 lbs).  The total amount of ammonia in the system is 21,500 lbs and spread through the system.  All the ammonia is never held in any vessel.  The engine room has an outside kill switch and ammonia detector.\n\n\n\nOther hazardous substances are used onsite, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\nThe policies, procedures and training that have been established will reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of it's employees and surroundings.  \n\n\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA and WA State Process Safety Management rules and regulations, WA State Safety Regulations, and IIAR Standards for Good Work Practices.  The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems used include:\n\n\n\n   Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n   Suction trap hi-level float\n\n   High discharge pressure shut down\n\n   Low suction pressure shut down\n\n   High discharge temperature shut down\n\n   Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n   High amperes shut down\n\n   Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\n\n   Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n   250 psi relief on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n   250 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\n   ECPS to equalize low and high pressures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures and checklists are used by employees performing operational functions.  Procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  T"

In addition to the operating procedures, management has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.  Coordination of response plans with Chelan County Fire District 7, Washington State Patrol, Chelan County Sheriff and Chelan County Emergency Management is ongoing.\n\n\n\nTraining on ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity will be a major ongoing process at the facility.  Review and update of the emergency plan will be done annually and drills and emergency evacuation practices will be executed, also.  Training will be required for all employees who work on or around the ammonia system, including fork lift personnel and contractors that come in to perform specific services.\n\n"
