The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County.  These plants adhere to all policies and procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as well as the Florida Department of Community Affairs and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nThe Lithia Water Treatment facility is located at 5402 Lithia Pinecrest Road, Lithia, Fl  33547.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states the owner or operator will assume the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur.\n\nThe worst case scenario at Lithia Watrer Plant involves an unspecified failure of a single one ton container of chlorine.  The offsite consequence analysis was performed utilizing the EPA lookup tables and was examined for two potential releases.  The EPA specified conditions for worst case scenario assume the release of the entire contents of the container in ten minutes, use of the one hour ERPG-2 toxic endpoint and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. The EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  The HCWD believes the EPA assumption to be unrealistic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere will flash to vapor.  The remaining liquid forms droplet aerosols.  This results in the formation of a dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dis"

Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentiallly affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximately six percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered at Lithia Water Plant include chlorine leak detection systems, vacuum piping and a fully enclosed chlorine storage facility.  The complete enclosure reduces the potential of any toxic plume by fifty-five percent.\n\nThe Water Department release prevention program is based on several elemsnts.\nTraining of staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nIn house inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availablity of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by staff during connection/disconnection of the chlorine supply, awarwenesss of hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine leak detection systems.  The facility also maintains a chlorine repair kit on site.\n\nLithia Water Plant is currently converting to liquid bleach.  All chlorine and conatiners should be off site by March 1, 2005."
