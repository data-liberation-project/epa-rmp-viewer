The facility is a poultry processing plant which employs approximately 603 associates to receive broiler and cornish meat plus other raw ingredients to form and prepare for distribution to the market place.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at the Salisbury facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 49,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components, although the normal operating inventory maintained is approximately 26,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\r\n\r\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans as part of an overall chemical management program."

Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health, and safety training to the its staff.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\nThe Perdue Farms Salisbury facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nPerdue's Salisbury facility has not had any accidents within the last five years involving anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our refrigeration system, Perdue's Salisbury facility has a well defined incident command system.  The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials.  Perdue continues to train our associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conduct mock drills routinely.  Perdue's officials have discussed the company's response program with our local fire department representatives.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Salisbury facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality.  Mechanical integrity inspections are conducted every 5 years to determine the integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Thermal imaging, dye penetrant, vibration and oil analysis are also conducted for added safety"
