Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response\nMcLane Carolina has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes aspects of emergency response such as evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. Nash County Emergency Management is the agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified."

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n- Compliance Audits\nMcLane Carolina conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n- Incident Investigation\nMcLane Carolina promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n- Employee Participation\nMcLane Carolina truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n- Contractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  McLane Carolina has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.

The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n- Operating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, McLane Carolina maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n- Training\nMcLane Carolina has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\nMcLane Carolina carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n- Management of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at McLane Carolina to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with Nash County Emergency Management which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around food processing and distribution.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA RMP*COMP as well as the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
