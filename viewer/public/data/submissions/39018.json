      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Pacific Epoxy Polymers, Inc.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Pacific Epoxy Polymers, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Richmond Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Development, manufacture and supply of raw materials for the epoxy resin formulator.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] and Formaldehyde (solution).  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for producing reactive diluents.  Formaldehyde (solution) is used for producing chemical resistant epoxy hardener.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 230,000.00 lb. while Formaldehyde (solution) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 5000.00 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragra"

      "SummaryText": "phs provide details of the chosen scenario.\n\nScenario: The Epichlorohydrin spill. \n\nPacific Epoxy Polymers receives its epichlorohydrin from tank wagons that come in without any pressure on them and are equipped with only dry disconnect valves.   If the vessels come in with pressure, the operator in charge of the unloading has to carefully release the pressure through controlled measures to avoid a hose from being blown off.\n\n \nIf by chance the pressure gauge was reading zero pounds of pressure and the actual pressure inside the vessel was over 15 pounds of pressure, an accidental release of epichlorohydrin could occur.  The operator, following the guidelines to offload epichlorohydrin, checks to see if the wagon has pressure and reads zero pounds.  As he opens the valve to start pumping the raw material into the bulk storage tank, the pressure built up inside the vessel blows the hose off the tank wagon spraying epichlorohydrin inside the building.  \n\nRemedy: The first thing the operator would have to do is to close the valve on the wagon using the emergency shut off valve located near the front of the tank wagon if he can get to it without putting himself in more danger.  Then evacuate the area and notify all personnel of the immediate dangers associated with the incident and evacuate the buildings.  Using the Emergency Response plan, that Pacific Epoxy Polymers created for a step by step guide dealing with an emergency situation, notify the proper authorities and agencies for the necessary clean up.  While waiting for the Hazwop team to arrive, the plant personnel with the help of the Richmond Fire Department would set up boundaries to keep harm from any individual.  MSDS?s would be distributed to the incoming Hazwop team and a decontamination center would also be set up.  Once the Hazwop team arrives, the authority would be transferred from Pacific Epoxy Polymers to them with the employees standing by to assist if needed.\n\nPrevention:  \n\nThe employees, that are "
