There is Temporary  Emergency Response Plan in effect as this is written, the US Foodservice - Las Vegas Division Emergency Response Plan is the sole plan and that is to coordinate all emergency efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration and maintenance firm. This plan is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1) To protect the Environment\n2) To minimize property damage\nIn the case of an ammonia - related emergency, it is the policy of US Foodservice to allow the fire department and the refrigeration contractors to respond to the emergency.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nThis US Foodservice Facility is a freezing and storage warehouse for the perishable food industry. This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 lbs. The ammonia inventory of this  system is approximately 16,000 lbs. Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of EPA's RMP program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at this US Foodservice Facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures)\nfor use in the preservation of perishable food products.This provides refrigerant temperatures of -20F, with the use of low suction compressor"

Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consists of a Frick Computer Controlled two temperature level, single stage system which operates at -20F. and +20F. Suction, and condensing with evaporative condensers at 95F.  The system provides cooling for the storage freezer,dock, two coolers, and the 75F. Dry storage area.\nThe system is controlled via microprocessors with hot gas defrost control, compressor sequencing, and evaporative condenser fan and pump control. The system is also capable of remote operation via modem and is capable of  temperature monitoring and control.\nAn ammonia detection system is installed as part of the central control system and will monitor locations where ammonia refrigerant is present. The system in theengine room will bring on emergency ventilation fans.\n\nSummary of Worst case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenarion is determined to be a catastrophic release from the high pressure reciever V-1. This vessel operates at ambedient temperature and above atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe V-1 receiver is a vertical vessel and is 7 feet in diameter and 16 feet in length. When 69 % filled, vessel capacity is approximately 16,000 lbs of ammonia.\n\nAssumed is that the release occurs through a circular hole located at the bottom of the vessel. For this worst case release scenario, the distance from the source to toxic endpoint is 1.4 miles or 7,392 feet.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario weather conditions"

The potential for a pipe failure is significant given the extensive ammonia piping system extending through the Facility.\n\nAssumed is the failure of a 1 inch pipe connected to the V-1 receiver. Using EPA-suggested meteoroligical parameters for alternative scenarios and following a one-hour release, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 195 yards or 585 feet.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\n\nIndustry Standards were followed for the manufacturing and quality control of these lines;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\nVessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\n\nActive mitigation considered would be the Emergency Shut-Down System which permits system to equalize to 50-60 psig.\n\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910-119) consists of the following elements :\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\nPre-Start Up Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no Ammonia Accidents at this Facility\n\nDescription of Emergency Plan\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Action Plan.
