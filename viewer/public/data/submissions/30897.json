The SLG process which \nis subject to 40 CFR Par 58 is the receiving, storage, transfer, and pressurization of a 2Qaerosol container,\nutilizing an aerosol grade propellant (100% 1,1 Difluoroethane), trade name 152A.  Written operating proced-\nures requiring daily personal and mechanical monitoring are closely followed to prevent no more than 13,000 \ngallons of 152A from being present in an 18000 gallon capacity, non-pressurized outside above-ground storage\ntank.  The tank is located in a fenced, secured area, an estimated 80' from the north wall of the facility and is\nvideo monitored 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  It is also physically inspected on a daily basis by maintenance\nand security professionals and weekly by production and regulatory/safety professionals.  Any deficiencies \nare documented and followed up with immediate remedial action.  Strict Good Manufacturing Processes and \nstate of the art active/passive detection, prevention and fire/explosion repression systems are utilized to\nminimize the possibility of any loss scenarios.  SLG is in complete compliance with local, state and federal \nregulations.  It is the philosophy of SLG to go beyond minimum requirements to approach compliance in a \ncomprehensive, multifaceted approach to aid in the prevention, detection and control of loss potentials.  SLG\nwas recently awarded Merit Status under VPP and will be scheduling their Star Audit in June 2005.  Although\nSLG has not experienced any loss incidents since beginning to utilize 152A in 2004 and its predecessor \n152a/A-17.8218 in 1996, response will be immediate wit"
