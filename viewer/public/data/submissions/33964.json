      "SummaryText": "Rohm and Haas Company - Knoxville Plant\nEPA Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Knoxville Plant is a manufacturing facility located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Rohm and Haas first came to Tennessee in 1943 as part of the national defense effort in World War II.  In a government-owned Plant, the company began production of Plexiglas acrylic sheet for use in American military aircraft.  Following the war, Rohm and Haas purchased the Knoxville facility and expanded its production capabilities to include acrylic polymers.\n\nAlthough no longer a Plexiglas manufacturer, the Rohm and Haas Company Knoxville Plant continues to provide acrylic polymer products which are used by our customers in the manufacture of laundry detergents, facial creams, diaper wipes, paint, caulk, paper coatings, and fiber filled products. In all phases of its operation, the Plant stresses safety and protection of the environment.\n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency preparedness plans, as well as the systems and training at Rohm and Haas designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and incidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate ?worst case? and ?alternative case? scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This summary is part of the Rohm and Haas Company Knoxville Plan"

Each are listed as RMP toxic chemicals.  Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate are raw materials that are chemically combined to form acrylic polymers.  Aqueous Ammonia is used as a neutralizer to adjust the pH of polymers.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Knoxville Plant has a long standing commitment to providing a safe workplace and implementation of procedures and practices to prevent accidental releases.  This commitment is clearly stated in the following Rohm and Haas Company Environmental, Health, Safety, and Sustainable Development principles: \n\n-     We will strive to ensure that our operations and products meet the needs of the present global community without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. We will integrate economic growth, environmental protection and social responsibility as important considerations into business decisions.\n\n-     We will ensure our worldwide operations and products are free from significant risks to the health and safety of our employees, customers, carriers, distributors, the general public and to the environment.\n\n-     We will meet or exceed all applicable laws and regulations, participate in voluntary initiatives such as Responsible Care? and strive for continual improvement in our Environmental, Health, Safety, and Sustainable Development performance.\n\n-     We will provide our employees with a safe workplace and support their efforts to work safely.\n\n-     We will strive to eliminate or reduce emissions, discharges, and wastes from every stage of our operations.\n\n-     We will communicate, listen and be responsive to our employees, customers, neighbors, and governments, and we will share information concerning potential hazards resultin"

We prevent accidents by taking measures to create and maintain safe conditions in all aspects of our operations including design, operations, and handling.  Examples of our safety protection measures include:\n\n-     Redundant safety systems and instrumentation\n-     Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n-     Secondary containment for storage tanks\n-     Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n-     Pressure relief devices to prevent overpressurization\n-     Fire protection systems\n-     Comprehensive written procedures and training programs\n-     Operator surveillance of unloading operations\n-     Permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n-     Preventative maintenance program for equipment\n-     Work preplanning\n- Comprehensive Plant security program\n-     Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) reviews for new processes and significant changes in existing processes\n\nPlant prevention programs are designed in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards.

This award is based on the number of lost time injuries, reportable accidents, and overall injuries during a calendar year. \n\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Knoxville Plant has had no accidental releases of Acrylonitrile, Aqueous Ammonia, or Vinyl Acetate in the past five years which resulted in deaths, injuries, significant on-site property damage, evacuations, sheltering in place, off-site property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility maintains an up-to-date emergency response plan which is coordinated with the local Fire Department and the Local Emergency Management Agency. The plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans, and is intended to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a hazardous material spill, protect the well-being of Rohm and Haas employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the Plant response plan have been provided to the local Police and Fire Departments, a local hospital, and the local and State Emergency Management Agencies.  \n\nA trained on-site incident commander is assigned the responsibility of coordinating the Plant response to any incident which may occur including communicating response needs with the local Fire Department responders.  An incident commander is on duty at the Plant 24 hours per day.   Plantwide emergency evacuation alarm systems are tested quarterly, and Plant evacuation drills are held annually.  Fire alarm bells are tested monthly.  Furthermore, the Plant regularly holds ?table top? exercises to discuss and drill on the proper response to a Plant emergency scenario.  All Plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan.  \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requiremen"

EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous Plant history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, these worst case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.  The Plant worst case scenario is documented and is based on the detailed requirements for worst case scenarios as prescribed by the RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternative release scenario.  Unlike worst case scenarios, the alternative release scenario can be limited by active mitigation and safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, the alternative release scenario is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders for emergency response preparedness and planning.\n\nThe alternative case scenarios for the Plant were chosen after review of the Plant spill history, process hazard analyses, and discussions regarding potential scenarios with knowledgeable and experienced operating department personnel.  The identified scenarios are more credible than the worst case scenario, but remain unlikely due to the design of the equipment and training of our employees.\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nIt is our belief that effective environmental, health, and safety systems must be continually improved.  We constantly strive to recognize areas for improvement and implement the changes necessary to achieve our goals.  Methods used to identify areas for improvement include:\n\n-     Process hazard analyses for manufacturing processes\n-     Internal audits of procedures and Plant inspections\n-     Safe behavior sampling\n-     Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) reviews f"
