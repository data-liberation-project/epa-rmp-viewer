The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to workers as well as the surrounding communities.\n\nIt is Luigino\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of ammonia is paramount at Luigino\u00bfs.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of ammonia are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, and failsafe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements being studied.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which ammonia refrigerant is handled, the safety devices inherent to the refrigeration system design, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of Luigino\u00bfs workers.\n\nLuigino\u00bfs believes that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in Luigino\u00bfs organization structure and employee empowerment.  \n\nExtensive improvements have been made to safety and health programs like the prevention program (process safety and risk management), emergency preparedness and response, and training.\n\nAdditionally, Luigin"

      "SummaryText": "o\u00bfs believes employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  This is known as employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved efficiencies at the plant.\n \n\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Luigino\u00bfs coordinates emergency response activities and training with the local emergency management organizations.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled\n\nLuigino's is a large domestic producer of processed foods that include Michelina's and Yu Sing food products.  The Luigino's Jackson plant site covers approximately 585,000 square feet (13.4 acres) within the Jackson City limits.  It is located at 100 East Broadway Street in Jackson, Ohio in Jackson County.\n\nThere are approximately 900 employees at the plant site, which are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers union organization.\n\nOnly one chemical covered by 40 CFR Part 68 is inventoried at the plant site.  This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous)- Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant.  It is received into the plant by truck, however deliveries of ammonia are infrequent.  One of the primary refrigeration vessels is the High Pressure Receiver vessel in Plant A. This vessel has a maximum inventory of 15,000 pounds that is controlled through administrative procedures.  There are three (3) refrigeration systems at the facility having a total capacity of approximately"

This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of the prevention program is to ensure complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n \n\nLuigino\u00bfs has completed a revalidation of their process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Revalidations were conducted in May 2004 and resulted in 3 recommendations.  The recommendations generated during this review were prioritized using a standardized Risk Rank Matrix method.\n\nFive year accident history\n\nLuigino\u00bfs has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained in the prevention program procedures.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\n\nIndividuals knowledgeable in refrigeration operation or the equipment being investigated lead formal incident investigations.  Root cause and corrective actions are determined and formal reports are prepared.  Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is tracked through final resolution.\n\nLuigino\u00bfs has not had an accidental release of ammonia within the past five years that resulted in an onsite injury or adversely affected the community.\n\n\nEmergency response Program\n\nLuigino\u00bfs emergency action plan has been designed to address likely incidents arising from our ammonia refrigeration system.  The emergency plan is a vital part of Luigino\u00bfs overall prevention program.  Luigino\u00bfs continues to plan for the unplanned ammonia release while striving to adhere to the latest mechanical integrity and inherently safer technologies.\n\n\nPlanned improvements to"

One of the primary aspects of the risk management program is the empowerment of each employee with the responsibility for continuous safe operations.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration employs a programmable logic controller as a means to control ammonia emissions and inadvertent ammonia releases to the atmosphere.  An audio, visual, olfactory leak detection and repair program that requires multiple checks per day will control refrigeration system emissions.  In addition, ammonia detectors are strategically located throughout the machine rooms to quickly detect any releases."
