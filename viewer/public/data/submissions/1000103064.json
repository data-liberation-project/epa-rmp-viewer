Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\nManagement of Change:\nThe Grey Wolf Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment function as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\nEnergy Transfer has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Grey Wolf Gas Plant, located in Wink, Texas operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from oil and gas wells. The Grey Wolf Gas Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. The Grey Wolf Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\nHazard Assessment Results:\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel (V-404) containing 232,400 pounds of NGL. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 mile. No passive mitigation measures were considered in evaluating this WCS.\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThe Grey Wolf Gas Plant facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Grey Wolf Gas Plant.
