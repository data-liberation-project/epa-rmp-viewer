Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia  which is considered hazardous by EPA We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the ANSI K-61.1 standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Flora Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and,  has  instructed employees on  procedures for notification of the local fire authority (Flora Fire Department) and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\nHS Gathering's Hambert Compressor Station is not covered under OSHA's PSM Standard because it is a normally unoccupied remote facility.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, HS Gathering personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, HS Gathering will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nHS Gathering's Hambert Compressor Station is located in Weld County, Colorado near the intersection of WCR 38 and WCR 35 in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.\n\nThe Hambert Compressor Station consists of two compressor unit, #51 and #52, that discharge 18 MMCF/D through glycol dehydration to delivery points via a 20\" cleanable pipeline.  The discharge pressure is not to exceed 180 psig.  The station is equipped with inlet seperation.  Liquids separation (condensate) goes to four 225 barrel storage tanks. \n\nThe purpose of a compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission.  Each compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transports the gas to a processing plant.  Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons).  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the well heads.  The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nAs gas flows"

      "SummaryText": "through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment.  If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will tend to condense.  The resulting buildup of hydrates can begin to restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, the hydrates may form a potentially dangerous ice plug.\n\nIn order to reduce the dew point of the gas (minimize the formation of hydrates), the inlet gas is put through a slug catcher, an inlet separator, and a glycol contactor with scrubber to remove moisture.  Compression of the gas causes some of the naturally occurring hydrocarbons, which are in the vapor phase of the inlet gas stream, to condense out of the stream.  This allows heavy hydrocarbons and water to condense out of the gas resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into a tank truck for transportation for processing into marketable products.  The glycol is regenerated and used again.\n\nThe flammability and volume of the raw NGL stored at The Hambert Compressor Station triggered coverage under the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Hambert Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the mid 1970's.  HS Resources entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in December of 1999.  KN Energy operated the system from April 1993 through December 1, 1999.\n\nProgram Level\n\nHS Gathering has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Hambert Compressor Station since it has a documented Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the local Fire Department and has had no accidental release of the regulated substance (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused a death, injury, or response or restoration activity for an environmental receptor in"

Also, the facility's distance to a \"public receptor\" is greater than the distance to the calculated endpoint for the worst-case scenario of 0.1 miles.\n\nOffsite consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with flammable substances in a Program Level 1 process at the Hambert Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a catastrophic tank failure in the condensate tank storage area.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 80% of the maximum tank capacity.  Therefore the reduced inventory is assumed, resulting in a release of 31,000 lbs. (approximately 5700 gals.) of condensate over a 10-minute period.  Although we have various controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures (such as dikes or berms) was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion of this material was 0.1 miles.  No Program Level 2 or 3 processes containing regulated flammable substances were identified at the Hambert Compressor Station.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Hambert Compressor Station has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\n\nAccident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents that meet the criterion for inclusion in this submittal\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.
