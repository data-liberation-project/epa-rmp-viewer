This hazard assessment also includes maps that delineate the off-site consequence (OCA) analysis.  The OCA analysis has not been included in this executive summary in accordance with EPA restrictions.\r\nThis OCA information has been provided to the general public (e.g. Local/State Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the local fire department/HAZMAT response team) through correspondence dated August 9, 2000 and a public meeting held on September 5, 2000.  The local agencies also receive a copy of the emergency response plan (periodically upon updating) and Tier II forms (annually).

Several other items will be addressed in accordance with recommended time frames.\r\n6.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS \r\nStandard Operating procedures either existed or were developed for the facility.  These include programs such as lockout/tagout, confined space, hot work permit, propane procedures, etc.  A number of these programs have standard operating procedures and checklist that are requisite for documenting regulatory compliance, particularly for the regulated propane process.  The instructions for completion of the forms are included in the RMP document.

The primary emphasis behind mechanical integrity is preventative maintenance.  The majority of process equipment has standard operating manuals and maintenance procedures that are kept in the office file.\r\nThe facility ensures that recommended maintenance is performed on process equipment in accordance with manufacturer?s recommendations.  In addition, modifications to existing systems are performed in accordance with manufacturer?s recommendations.  \r\nUST certifies that the propane system was designed in accordance with recognized engineering standards at the time of original construction and during subsequent renovations or modifications.  The propane system was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis.  UST follows the manufacturer?s recommendations for maintenance and inspection.\r\nOstermans leases the tank to UST and maintains the propane system and equipment on an annual basis.  Work orders and inspection checklist for the annual work are maintained as documentation of Osterman?s propane system maintenanc"

This procedure is implemented by using the Management of Change forms (MOC) found in Section 9.5 of the RMP.  \r\nThese forms provide a system that evaluates potential changes to the system and potential effects on the process safety operation.  The forms must be completed any time there is a change to the process that could affect the overall safety of the chemical system.  All RMPC designees are familiar with this process.\r\nSince December 2000, there have been minor changes to the system to include the addition of one generator identical to the two existing generators.  The plan has been updated accordingly. Operating procedures for the new generator are identical to procedures for the existing generators.\r\n10.0\tPRE-START SAFETY REVIEW \r\nThe facility performs a pre-startup safety review for new or modified facilities as necessary.  The checklist found in Section 5 (PHA) of the RMP provides the necessary information to review and evaluate potential modifications to the existing process.  This process is started as soon as possible in the conceptual design of the project.\r\nIf there are any renovations or facility changes that would impact the process systems, it is required that the forms found in Section 10.4 (Action Item Documentation) of the RMP be completed and that any action items be incorporated into the project.  Appropriate changes may also be necessary in standard operating procedures (e.g. lockout/tagout, emergency plan, operating procedures, etc.).  These can be made through Section 9 (Management of Change Procedure) of the RMP.\r\nSince December 2000, there have been no significant changes that would require Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews.\r\n11.0\tCOMPLIANCE AUDITS \r\nComprehensive compliance audits must be performed at least every three years, while some specific p"

      "SummaryText": "rograms (e.g., operating procedures, lockout/tagout, etc.) should be reviewed annually by the RMPC or his designees.  The facility reportedly reviews these latter programs during annual training activities.  We have provided a summary of our recommendations for our September 30, 2003 audit that are detailed in the Tighe & Bond correspondence dated January 20, 2004.  \r\n12.0\tINCIDENT INVESTIGATION \r\nThe facility must investigate every incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals within 48 hours of the incident.  We recommend that all accidents be investigated.  The standard investigation system for evaluating these types of accidents is included in Section 12.4 of the RMP.  This includes an investigation form that must be completed at the time of the accident.\r\nUpon completion of this activity, a group of individuals should investigate and determine why the accident took place.  Recommendations for corrective actions should be provided, implemented, and documented.  This should minimize the potential for reoccurrence of future similar accidents.\r\nSince December 2000, there have been no reportable incidents at the facility relative to the propane system. There was a minor issue with the vaporizer pilot light shutting off. This minor problem has reportedly been corrected by reinstallation of the damaged vaporizer door.\r\n\r\n13.0\tEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nEmployees are one of the key components in safety management systems.  The facility involves employees for the implementation of this plan as follows:\r\n* Employees are involved in safety procedure development and the PHA;\r\n* Employees are provided periodic training at regular safety meetings;\r\n* Safety meetings empower employees to recommend and implement corrective actions; and \r\n* A process has been implemented to consider employee recommendations.\r\nEmployee recommendations are incorporated into H&S procedures, where applicable.  \r\n14.0\tHOT WORK PERMI"

      "SummaryText": "TS \r\nThis system provides a process whereby each heat producing work activity is evaluated and controlled to prevent fires.  Efforts are made to ensure that the entire facility completes hot work permits if the activity is outside a dedicated fire protected areas (e.g. shop).  This will minimize the potential for catastrophic fires that could affect the propane process.  The instruction and permits can be found in Section 14.0 of the RMP.  The hot work permits are on file for work performed in the facility.\r\n15.0\tCONTRACTORS\r\nThe facility must inform contract employers of the potential hazards of the process and ensure that they are properly trained.  Before working in and around hazardous processes, these contractors are provided the facility?s safety requirements and notification forms found in Section 15.0 of the RMP.  \r\nContractor evaluation forms were sent to Ostermans.  Completed evaluation forms can be found at the end of the CONTRACTOR SAFETY Section 15.0.  Additional evaluation forms were also sent to the following contractors:\r\n\t- Accurate Mechanical\r\t- Lucier Rigging\r\t- W.H. Park\r\t- Collins Electric\r\t- Praxair\r\t- Maybury\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  \r\nEmployers must establish and implement a plan that deals with emergency situations at the facility to include the handling of small chemical releases.  A standard emergency evacuation plan is available for the facility in the EMS-007 Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.  It should be noted that specific propane emergency measures can also be found in the operating procedures in Section 6.0 of the RMP.\r\nThis information has been provided to the general public (e.g. Local/State Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the local fire department/HAZMAT response team) through correspondence dated August 9, 2000 and the public meeting held on September 5, 2000.  The local agencies also receive a copy of the emergency response plan (periodically upon updating) and Tier II forms (annually).  Emerg"
