We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care?.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to  applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling of chlorine.  Vulcan is in compliance with the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Security Code.  A security vulnerability analysis has been conducted and Vulcan has implemented comprehensive security procedures and improvements such as perimeter digital video camera system, improved peerimeter lighting, and an access control system.  A transportation security plan has also been implemented including necessary training of affected employees.\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs to ensure site integrity.  Examples of some such controls include 1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, 2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, 3) limiting inventory in chlorine storage tanks, 4) monitoring vessel and piping pressures.\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained personnel wi"

Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves which limit the amount of chemical released, a  fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate personnel protective equipment, and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  Should a release occur, we use a dispersion model - Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER), and meteorological data from our weather tower, to predict the plume direction and size, downwind ground level concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach off site areas.  This information is communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant is primarily involved in manufacturing chlorine and other inorganic chemicals. As a part of these manufacturing processes, we produce chlorine which is covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68). \nFollowing is a brief description of the facility and a list of RMP-regulated processes at our facility.\nChlorine is the only RMP regulated substance managed at the plant. The RMp process is the chlorine production including chlorine rail car loading  The process is a  Program Level 3.  Vulcan products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout the United Sates and global economies.  Chlorine is sold as a product and is also used as a feedstock in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid.  Common uses of chlorine include  treatment of municipal water supplies, sewage and wastewater. Chlorine is also used to make bleach.  We use a combination of good design practices,  release prevention programs, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND"

      "SummaryText": " CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and this RMP rule.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below:\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe the chemicals and processes at our facility.  These documents are kept up to date and are available to all employees and address important process parameters such as (1) operating limits for the equipment, (2) design basis and configuration of the equipment, and (3) physical properties and hazards of the chemicals used in our processes. Plant personnel rely on these documents to perform their job functions properly, consistently and in a safe manner.\nChemical information is documented in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). MSDSs contain information concerning the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical.  This information typically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical data, (3) reactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and chemical stability data, and (5) hazards of mixing substances together.  MSDSs are available to all employees, as well as the emergency responders in our community.\nImportant process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents  include (1) safe operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) pressure relief system design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams, and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits, and hazards of each process.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with our pr"

Each process is examined in detail to ensure that all hazards are identified and that appropriate controls are in place to manage those hazards.   Our hazard assessments focus on preventing injuries to the plant personnel, the community and  preventing adverse impacts to the environment.\n\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis or a What If / Check List is typically used for our process hazard analyses.  A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are reviewed by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they ar"

Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  Both classroom and on the job training is provided.  In addition to training in specific job functions, training is also provided on safe work practices.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  Predictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography and ultrasonic analysis.  Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps and motors.  Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment and ultrasonic technology is used to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping.

Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training, and (5) required documentation.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nWe review any changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measures are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions, and (4) all training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Vulcan-Port Edwards plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete, (4) a process hazard analysis has been perfor"

Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and provide recommendations for ensuring that the incident does not recur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved.  Some examples of changes made as a result of incident investigations include developing new procedures or revising existing ones, changing equipment construction material and requiring operators to perform additional monitoring.\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are routinely asked to participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, management of change, hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention program.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program, and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process areas.  The various ways employees are involved in the prevention program are documented in a written plan.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of our employees.  Examples of these procedures include  (1) a daily safe work permit-job specfic, (2) a hot work permit that is designed to control spark or flame-producing activities, (3) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry, and (4) a lockout / tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance.

All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner.  A contractor?s safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.\nOnce a contractor is selected, the Vulcan-Port Edwards plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, (3) understand the emergency response procedures, and (4) report any hazards they find during their work.  Our personnel periodically monitor contractor activities to ensure they are performing their work in a safe manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nA compliance audit is performed periodically to help ensure that the prevention program activities at our facility are adequate and that safety issues are addressed effectively.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.
