Kleiber, Manager\n\n           The owners, management, and employees of Ag Service Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\n           \n           Ag Service Inc. is an ag retail business that sells fertilizer & chemical for use in crop production to local famers.  The primary activity at the facility is the blending of ag fertilizer for use by local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is purchased at our plant to be used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n\n            The maximum amount the can be stored at our facility is 44000 lbs or approximately 8500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 44000 lbs. or one semi-trailer load of anhydrous ammonia. \n            \n            The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum amount released would be 44000 lbs which is 85% of our storage tank capacity.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.5 miles with residential population within distance at 25 people.\n\n            The most likely potential release incident would be from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .8 miles with residential population within distance at 12 people.\n\n             We have implemented and have posted at our anhydrous plant our emergency response guidelines for handling of anhydrous ammonia.  These guidelines include responses in case of fire, spills or leaks, and f"
