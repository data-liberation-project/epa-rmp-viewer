The program includes a hazard assessment that evaluates both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. This document serves a vital community right to know function by informing the public of potential risks associated with the releases of chlorine  and described the City's efforts to minimize such risks.\n\n\n\nREGULATORY BACKGROUND\n\nSection 112(r) of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required certain facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provision,\" rules (contained in 40 CFR Part 68) to implement the 112(r) requirements. Under this rule, all covered facilities must implement a risk management program and file a risk management plan with the EPA by June 21, 1999. A covered facility would be one that uses, stores, manufactures, handles, or moves any of the 140 chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68 at quantities exceeding the threshold levels as provided in the regulations.\n\n\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe City of Calhoun  Brittany Drive water treatment plant (WTP) is a covered facility because of the proposed usage and storage of chlorine. Chlorine is a regulated substance, and the respective threshold quantities are 2,500 pounds under the regulations. The chlorination facilities at the Calhoun WTP consist of eight 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (potential for a total of 16,000 pounds of chlorine). Since the storage quantities of chlorine exceed threshold"

      "SummaryText": ", Calhoun WTP is a covered facility under the Risk Management Plan rules.\n\n\n\nThe City of Calhoun owns and operates a 12.8 million gallon per day (MGD) WTP in Calhoun, Georgia. The WTP provides potable water to the local residential population and the numerous industries that are located in the City. The WTP is a conventional filtration  and pressure vessel treatment system. Raw water is pumped from the wells or from a spring. Chlorine is the primary disinfectant used at this facility.  The RMP focuses on the chlorination facilities at Calhoun WTP. Based on the quantities of chlorine stored at the Calhoun WTP, it is very likely that there will be off-site consequences for public receptors in the event of a worst-case release, and therefore Calhoun WTP will not qualify as a Program 1 facility. Since Georgia is a federal OSHA state (i.e., Georgia has not been delegated OSHA responsibilities), state and local governments within Georgia are not subject to OSHA PSM standards, and therefore Calhoun WTP will not be a Program 3 facility. Thus, the Calhoun Brittany Drive WTP will be classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis consists of two components: a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis (worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario) was conducted using look-up tables contained in the RMP guidance for wastewater treatment facilities.  Worst case release from the WTP covers a radius of 3 miles and affects 8,600 persons.  An alternative release at the WTP covers 0.3 miles and may impact no more than 250 people.  Public receptors are impacted by the worst case release scenario and not by the alternative release scenario.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWorst-Case scenario has been defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance form a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance t"

      "SummaryText": "o an end point (DTE). The DTE is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur. In the case of Calhoun WTP, the worst-case scenario would involve the sudden release of the contents of a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine. RMP Program Guidance for Water Treatment Plants (RMP guidance) was used to estimate the DTE associated with a worst-case release. The calculations did not consider any passive mitigation systems. The guidance assumes that the contents of a 1-ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) are completely released over a 10-minute period with a corresponding release rate of 222 lb/min. The model assumes a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class F. Using this approach, it is predicted that a worst-case release of chlorine will result in a DTE of 3.0 miles, in a rural setting such as Calhoun, with an end point concentration of 0.0087 mg/L. The worst-case release DTE encompasses an area within a three mile radius, with an end point concentration of 0.0078 mg/L. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for a covered process is one that is more likely to occur than a worst-case scenario. The RMP guidance suggests that the alternative release scenario should reach an endpoint off site, unless no such scenario exists. Based on an evaluation of the processes and procedures at the Calhoun WTP, it appears that a vapor release scenario is most likely. RMP guidance was used to estimate the DTE for a vapor release from a hole of = inch in diameter. Figure 3 presents a site map of the affected area from an alternative release scenario of chlorine. Calculation sin the guidance assume a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability class D. No active or passive mitigation systems were considered.\n\n\n\nFor a vapor release hole diameter of = inch, the release rate of chlorine is estimated to be 37 lbs/min with a DTE of 0.3 miles. \n\n\n\nO"

      "SummaryText": "ff-site Human Receptors\n\nPublic receptors include off-site residences; institutions (e.g., schools); industrial, commercial, and office buildings; and parks or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time without restriction by the stationary source where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure as a result of an accidental release. \n\n\n\nWorst-case Scenario (Chlorine)\n\nLandview software was used to estimate the population affected from a worst-case release. From the affected area maps, it is clear that the schools and recreational areas will be affected. Therefore, a worst-case release will impact 8,600 persons, which is the population of within the affected area according to information in Landview.\n\n\n\nPublic receptors impacted by a worst-case release are as follows:\n\nSonoraville School\n\nSonoraville reacreation area\n\nResidences\n\nDay Care facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (Chlorine)\n\nNo environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release.\n\n\n\nLeak Detection Procedure \n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided in the chlorine cylinder storage room and the evaporator room. These detectors can detect a leak at a level of 1 ppm if properly calibrated. Chlorine leaks can also be readily detected by smell even at low concentrations. Chlorine gas connections under pressure should be periodically inspected for the following:\n\n\n\nDiscoloration of Joint: If a leak is in progress, cadmium plating provided over bronze and brass fittings will disappear and the base metal will take on a reddish color. Green copper chloride may also form around the leak area.\n\n\n\nMoisture Formation: Small droplets of water may appear on the underside of leaking chlorine joint. It is recommended that chlorine lines be painted in bright yellow so that brown rush holes will be readily visible.\n\n\n\nAmmonia can be used to detect chlorine leaks. If ammonia vapor is directed at a leak, a white cloud will form indica"

Annual coordination may include facility tours, chlorine safety training, and chlorine response drills. The local coordinating agencies have been provided with a copy of the report, and agreements have been reached with local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Procedures\n\nResponse Procedures are dictated by the magnitude of the release.

If the employee is trained in controlling chlorine leaks, and the leak is minor and appears controllable, he or she should act immediately to rectify the situation.  In no event must the employee act in a manner that will endanger his or her safety.  If the leak appears serious enough that one person cannot control the situation, the employee must not act alone.  The employee must summon help and in the meantime gather the tools/equipment needed to control the leak.  After the plant operator or emergency coordinator arrives on the scene, the employees must jointly attempt to control the leak. Control of leak is the first priority for the employees.  Regulatory agencies may not be notified in the event of a small leak. However, authorities at the City of Calhoun including the Director of Utilities should be notified irrespective of the magnitude of the release.\n\n\n\nResponse Actions of Medium Release Scenario\n\nA determination that a release is medium rather than small is a judgment call made by the employee detecting the leak based on a visual evaluation of the situation.  The employee who noticed the leak should immediately notify the plant operator and emergency coordinator of the leak and alert them that the release appears to be medium. If the employee is trained in the control of gas leaks he or she must wear a SCBA and wait upwind of the source for the plant operator and emergency coordinator to arrive at the scene.  The plant operator must evacuate the facility of all employees except those who will participate in leak control efforts.  The plant operator must also immediately alert the local emergency response agencies that their assistance may be needed in the areas of community evacuation and medical help, if the leak gets "

Control of the leak should be the first priority for the employees. Authorities at the City of Calhoun including the Director of Utilities will be notified of the release. Regulatory agencies will be notified following the discussion with the Authority personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Actions of Large Release Scenario\n\nResponse actions for a large release are similar to a medium-scale release.  However, in this scenario, the accident is so major (such as a ruptured cylinder) that the bulk of the response efforts are tailored toward post-release mitigation, community evacuation and medical assistance.  Community evacuation if required should be conducted with the assistance of the local police and fire departments.  Any residents living in the zone of influence should be temporarily evacuated to an area of safety until such a time that the release gets controlled and the leaking gases are dispersed.  Traffic control on roads downwind of the release will be necessary to prevent persons from entering the gas release zone.\n\nImmediate medical assistance should be provided to facility employees and community members requiring assistance.  Providing medical assistance will require the support of ambulance service, paramedics, doctors, and local hospitals.\n\n\n\nRelease notification is of two types: verbal and written.  When making a verbal notification immediately after the release incident, the following information should be provided to the EPCRA hotline at 1-800-535-0202:\n\n\n\nName of caller\n\nName of facility\n\nLocation information\n\nChemical released (Chlorine)\n\nDate, time and duration of release\n\nRelease quantity estimate\n\nRemedial measures undertaken\n\n\n\nThe verbal notification must be followed by a written notice within 24 hours after the emergency situation is controlled.
