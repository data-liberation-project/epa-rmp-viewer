      "SummaryText": "Boar's Head Provisions Co. Inc. operates a meat processing plant located at 2230 Wyatts Mill Rd. Jarratt, Virginia, the plant employs 600 production personnel distributed on three shifts. The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) in the refrigeration system as a heat transfer media. Most of the facility is cooled to 35 to 40 degrees in order to preserve the meat products and food items. The ammonia refrigeration system is computer controlled and the facility is manned 24 hours a day 7 days a week. The materials used in the covered process are of the highest standards available to the industry and the Boar's Head Management and Engineering team maintains that the contractors used to install or maintain the refrigeration system meet the highest qualifications dictated by the P.S.M. standard. The facility has ammonia detectors located in the refrigeration equipment rooms as well as the main production areas. The facility is operated under the P.S.M. standard and complies with all O.S.H.A. and federal as well as state and local codes and ordinances.\n\n PROCESS TECHINICAL DESCRIPTION:\nThe refrigeration system operates as a two-stage ammonia recirculation system @ 4:1recirculation rate. Defrost is achieved by utilizing hot gas taken directly from the compressor discharge header. \nIn the compressor room there are a total of (7) seven Frick screw compressors: (2) (#1&2) RWB-40, (1) one (#3) RWB-54, (1) one (#4) RWBII-134, (2) (#5&6) RWBII-177 and one (#7) RWBII-222. Under normal operation conditions (1) one (#1) RWB-40 operates as a booster compressor and maintains a -22 (2psig) in the (#1) 42\"x12' vertical recirculator. This accumulator is dedicated to the -20F/-10F freezer, the Howe ice makers and the Polar Massager glycol chiller units. The booster's discharge gas flows into the intercooler below the liquid ammonia level where the gas is desuperheated. The (6) six other screw compressors operate as high stage compressors maintaining a +12F (25psig) temperature in both the"

These three vessels are dedicated to the cooler and production area loads throughout the plant.\nThe (#2) compressor and the (#4) compressor are cross connected to the freezer suction and are able to swing to either duty as required.\nThe high stage compressors discharge gas into the refrigerant discharge piping header through which it enters the (1) Frick AFC-350, (1) Imeco XLPH-365, (1) Evapco PMCA-585 and two (2) Imeco XLP-XL-710 evaporative condensers. In the condensers the ammonia gas is cooled and condensed into a liquid state (95F) and flows into the 60\"x 18' horizontal high pressure receiver located under the condensers. The liquid leaves the receiver to feed the (4) four recirculators and the intercooler as well as cooling for the seven Frick compressors.\nThrought the ammonia refrigeration system and the related piping there are 33,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n                                                                                                             \n CONTINGENCY PLAN:\nIf an associate or supervisor/manager identifies an emergency situation they must contact the nearest supervisor or manager of the area. He/she will investigate the problem and decide if the Emergency Response Plan needs to be activated. The supervisor/manager will then notify the guardhouse of the situation and give the pre-determined codes. Depending on the severity of the situation the guard on duty will notify the plant manager and he will at this time decide what type of evacuation should take place (total or partial). When the complexity so indicates he will notify the Boar's Head HAZMAT team and begin the emergency response system.

Due to the circumstances that may arise, there may be an ammonia release.  The release may be (minor) tolerable or major (intolerable).  A minor release is a release of anhydrous ammonia in concentrations less than 50 ppm.  If a release is minor, the supervisor will be notified and the plant manager will be notified.  Refrigeration technicians shall respond to the situation and take control after contacting the refrigeration supervisor.  If a release is termed a major release, the above steps shall be taken, plant evacuation will occur and the HAZMAT team will be called upon.  A major release would be a release in excess of 50 ppm and require the Incident Command System be formed.\r\n\r\nb. If the release is in excess of 100 lbs. or more, then the EPA and VDEQ (Virginia Department of Environmental Quality) shall be notified.
