Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Owen Storage Terminal is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. At the terminal, propane is received via railcar and stored in pressure tanks. Propane is loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only. Propane is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Owen Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. We have two process at the facility LPG Storage Terminal and Rail storage area.  The LPG storage terminal has the larger off site consequence.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated w"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Plains purchased the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Owen Storage Terminal within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Owen Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Clark County LEPC. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n\u00bf The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n\u00bf The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereb"
