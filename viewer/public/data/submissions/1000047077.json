If an emergency were to occur, it is United Cooperative's policy to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n5.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe Pulaski facility  herein referenced as the stationary source. The primary activity at this facility source) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients. The anhydrous ammonia is liquefied under pressure in the various storage vessels located at the facility.   The maximum quantity that could fill the 26,500 gallon (water capacity) would be 136,200 pounds> The maximum stored @ 85%  operating range is approximately 120,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n5.3    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical acc"

Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nUnited Cooperative maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  United Cooperative inspection includes one 26,500 gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessels, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n5.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, United Cooperative maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\n5.5    Training\n\n\n\nUnited has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.
