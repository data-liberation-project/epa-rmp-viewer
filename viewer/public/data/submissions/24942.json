We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases, based on EPA guidelines\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Ferro Delaware River Plant produces the following products, using a variety of materials and processing operations: \n\n * Benzyl chloride, which is used as an intermediate to produce a variety of end-products, including plasticizers, perfumes, biocides, and flavorings.\n\n * Tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (brand name is Tetrathal (R)), which is used to produce pigments and polyester resin flame retardants.\n\n * Plasticizers, which are used to produce vinyl flooring, wire coating, caulk, and other soft vinyl end pro"

Our plant employs approximately 130 people, including operators, mechanics, supervisory and technical people, plus approximately 15 maintenance and construction contractors on a full-time basis.  Our plant has operated safely since its initial startup in 1961without a major incident affecting our community.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals:\n\nToxics\n\nOur facility uses two RMP-regulated toxic chemicals, chlorine and phosphorus oxychloride,  to produce our products.\n\nChlorine, which is purchased and not manufactured, is used at our site to produce benzyl chloride and Tetrathal(R), is stored in and used from 90 ton railroad tank cars shared between the two processes.  Chlorine is a gas at normal pressure and temperature, but is stored as a liquid under pressure in the tank cars.  It is unloaded directly from the tank car into a steam-heated vaporizer, where it is heated up to vaporize the liquid chlorine for use in both the benzyl chloride and Tetrathal(R) processes. We store a maximum of (14) chlorine tank cars on our property, although no more than (2) cars are connected to the process at any one time.\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) is used in our Phosphate Esters manufacturing facility to manufacture dibutyl phenyl phosphate (DBPP), tri-isobutyl phosphate (TiBP) and several plasticizer products (Santicizers 141, 148,"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals. The Worst-Case Scenario, as defined by the EPA, is a hypothetical and extremely unlikely incident in which the largest amount possible of a regulated substance is accidentally released within 10 minutes. Worst-case scenarios assume no active mitigation (i.e. assume failure of response procedures or equipment to stop or contain the release), but do take into affect passive mitigation (facilities that do not require people or energy to operate such as a containment dike or building).\n\nBased on the EPA definition, our site's Worst-Case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of a 90-ton chlorine railroad tank car, resulting in the loss of the entire contents in 10 minutes. The resulting spill of liquid chlorine would vaporize, forming a plume that would travel with the prevailing wind direction to an endpoint distance (distance within which people exposed for up to one hour would suffer permanent health effects) as estimated by dispersion modeling.  This is a highly improbable scenario, due to the strict requirements for construction and maintenance of the tank cars used to transport and store chlorine. The walls of the car"

A remote shutoff valve and an excess-flow valve are provided to stop flow in the event of failure in the unloading line. An outer insulation shell is provided to prevent overheating in the event of a nearby fire. A relief valve is also provided to prevent overpressurization of the car. Tank cars are stored and moved on dead-end sidings where travel speed is low, and our railroad tracks are well-maintained. A special siding is used for unloading tank cars, isolated from the main track by locked deraillers to prevent inadvertent contact.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios, as defined by EPA, are hypothetical or actual incidents which are more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Scenario, but which take into account procedures and equipment which would be used to stop or contain the release (such as closing a valve or shutting down a process system). It must be also be assumed that the resulting release reaches an off-site receptor.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine involves failure of the chlorine unloading hose, resulting in the loss of approximately 2500 lb. over a 10-minute time period. \nThe Alternative Release Scenario for phosphorus oxychloride involves a reactor outlet piping leak, resulting in a spill of approximately 1500 lbs. over a 30-minute time period.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nWe have no RMP-regulated flammables stored or handled at our facility.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach t"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n* In August, 1996, there was a small release of chlorine from a vent system in the benzyl chloride process. A truck driver, who was in the area was was subsequently treated at a nearby hospital for respiratory problems.\n\nAs with all significant incidents at our facility, a formal investigation was conducted to identify and correct the root causes of this incident.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Ferro Delaware River Plant maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  \n\nFeatures of our emergency response plan include the following:\n\n *  Atmospheric monitors to provide prompt detection of leaks."
