Pacific Ethanol Aurora East uses natural gasoline as a denaturant to blend with fuel ethanol, which is a flammable mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated components above the 10,000 lb threshold quantities: pentane, isopentane and butane.\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 313,949 pounds. The liquid denaturant is stored in a single above ground atmospheric tank with a floating roof.  Denaturant is blended at 2-5% by volume with fuel ethanol at the tank farm location.   The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area, which includes secondary containment. The tank farm is located away from the main production areas and occupancy areas of the facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora East is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Aurora East to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of denaturant, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Aurora East to notify the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Aurora Fire Department to mitigate the emergency.  The facility does have a services contract with a hazardous materials emergency spill response contractor.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora East maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to "

As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is very similar to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. Aurora East's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM/RMP Plan.   \n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora East has not had any accidents related to the RMP-regulated substances which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora East is a non-responding facility and has chosen to maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance to ensure employee & community safety in the event of an emergency. In general, the EAP provides procedures to report a fire or other emergency; procedures for emergency evacuation; procedures to for employees who remain to operate critical plant operations prior to evacuation; contact information for employees responsible for communicating plan information; details regarding the employee alarm system; an employee training program for evacuation; and procedures for routine review and updates to the plan. In addition, the Facility has coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is a part of the written community Emergency Response Plan. The Aurora Fire Department provides first response for all Facility emergencies.  In addition, Pacific Ethanol Aurora East has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of its emergency action plan. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency action duties. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAurora East has been constructed with features to ensure safe operation of the flammable processes.
