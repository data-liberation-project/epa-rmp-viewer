Senior management commitment to safety has been established as a top-down function that includes employee involvement and associated agencies and appropriate vendors and contractors.  The Town of Jupiter policies include local response to small spills, 911 responses to releases and an on-going maintenance and training efforts that include appropriate documentation.\n\n2.0  ?Your facility and the regulated substances handled?\n\nThe Town of Jupiter WTP provides potable drinking water to the residents of the Town of Jupiter, Tequesta, Juno, Palm Beach County unincorporated areas and Martin County, and uses chlorine gas injection for disinfection purposes.  This process has been in use for approximately 25 years.  The process is stable as no releases have occurred over this period.  The WTP produces an average of 13.5 MGD of water daily for a service area of 63,000 residents @ 2.46 people per residential connection.  The WTP uses and estimated 1,900 lbs. of chlorine daily depending on the season of the year of chlorine with a total storage capacity of 80,000 lbs. or 40 containers.  Other substances are used but are well below the EPA threshold limits for regulation.\n\n3.0  ?The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)?\n\nThe two release scenarios of chlorine at the Jupiter WTP were considered. The worst case release was one-ton container (2,000 pounds) of gaseous chlorine at a release rate of 110 pounds per minute in a total of 600 seconds.  This has a potential of a 0.9-mile radius ?plume? dispersion.  The alternative release scenario consisted of 317 pounds of chlorine at a release rate of 10"

The alternate release could have a 0.1-mile radius plume dispersal.\n\n4.0   ?The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps?\n\nThe details of the Town of Jupiter WTP Prevention Programs are contained in ?Part VI ? Prevention Programs? of this document.  There are a full range of prevention activities ranging from daily and routine maintenance, maintenance documentation, training, employee awareness and involvement, and managerial policies, procedures and documentation. Vendor activities are controlled, and employee, public, and environmental safety are paramount in all plant activities.\n\n5.0  ?The five year accident history?\n\nThe Jupiter WTP personnel have conducted a thorough record search and have not discovered any reportable releases in the history of the WTP.  This covers a period much longer than the five-year period.\n\nOccasional small chlorine leaks, associated with packing glands and valve stem packing (i.e., the potential risk stated above as ?leaking fittings, valves, seals or connections?) have periodically occurred.\n\n6.0  ?The Emergency Response Program?\n\nThe Jupiter WTP Emergency Response Program (ERP) and the Emergency Spill Response Program (ESRP) are presented in this RMP.  The Town of Jupiter policies are in effect that allows employee response to small releases.  Large releases are directed to the Palm Beach County Regional Hazardous Materials Response Team (PBCRHMRT) with 911 calls, and evacuation of the facility.\n\nPersonnel training and drills are conducted for WTP personnel.  Alert systems are already in place.\n\nThe Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) handle public notification in a larger, more encompassing regional response plan, outside the jurisdiction of the WTP.\n \n7.0  ?Planned changes to improve safety?\n\nChanges to improve safety were derived from performing the process hazards analysis (PHA) which began in June 2001.
