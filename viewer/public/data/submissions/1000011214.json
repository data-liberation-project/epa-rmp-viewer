To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp program.  A worst case release of the syngas would be a vapor cloud explosion which would cover an estimated distance of 0.4 miles or 0.6 kilometers.  The alternate release would be a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).  The estimated distance at which exposure may cause second-degree burns is approximately 0.42 miles or 0.7 kilometers.  Additional specific information on these releases is presented in detail in the RMP.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSGS has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Program for syngas use and storage.  A management system has been established to maintain the elements of the PSM and Risk Management Programs.  Applicable written elements of the PSM and the Risk Management Program are readily accessible by employees.  Audible alarms located throughout the facility provide reliable notification of syngas (hydrogen) releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, one accident occurred.  The incident took place on April 28, 2008, in which a total of 36,485 lbs of gas was released.  This released amount is the full amount of syngas contained in the process, as well as the additional gas that was produced during the approximate three to five minutes that it took to shut down the system.  The syngas was above its auto ignition temperature, thus it was combusted upon release.  The accident resulted in two onsite (contractor) fatalities and four onsite injuries.  No one from the community was affected or evacuated during the incident.    Under the OSHA PSM requirements for Root Cause Investigation, a full RCI was conducted and multiple corrective actions implemented to prevent reoccurrence of a similar incident.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe SGS plant mai"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. Plant and process modifications are also administered through the MOC and PSSR processes as applicable, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in these changes.  Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs on an annual basis.  Annual mock drills are conducted at the facility and frequent communications with local emergency response teams ensure that they are aware of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs overall process and hazards.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSGS is committed to continuous improvement and safe operation of its petcoke and/or coal gasification system.

The facility has fully integrated employees in emergency response team.   Appropriate personnel protective equipment including respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus are available onsite for response to emergency situations.\n\n\nDescription and Regulated Substance\n\nThe sgSolutions, LLC facility (SGS) is located at 444 W. Sandford Avenue in West Terre Haute, Indiana.  The facility completed construction in 1995 and is located on approximately 14 acres.   Wabash Valley Power Association and Standard General are the owners of SGS.   Conoco Phillips provides technical and managerial services on behalf of the owner.  Plant operations and support staff are employed by SGS.  \n\nSGS operates an Air Separation Unit (ASU) that provides nitrogen and oxygen for the gasification process.  SGS also operates a gasification facility using ConocoPhillips E-Gas Technology in which coal/petcoke is converted to a synthetic fuel gas (syngas).  The syngas is then used to power a combustion turbine at the Wabash River Combined Cycle Plant located adjacent to SGS.  The syngas is a mixture of gases, including hydrogen.  The maximum amount of syngas on site when the plant is in operation, in the vessels and interconnecting piping, is approximately 34,500 lbs.   The only chemical that exceeds the RMP threshold quantities is hydrogen, which is found in concentrations within the syngas product at greater than 1% when the plant is in operation.  No other regulated substances (toxic or flammables) at the facility are stored or used at quantities which would require compliance with the Risk Management Program.\n\nHazards Assessments\n\nThe Worst  Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for hydrogen"
