Two one-ton containers of chlorine are stored in the facility.  Two of them are connected to the system at one time.  The facility is staffed 12-hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 100 and 200 feet away from the chlorination building.\n\nPopulation estimates are based on 2020 U.S. Census Bureau data from ALOHA and MARPLOT. The Los Fresnos population has increased more than 30% in the past decade, so the potentially affected population should be higher than the numbers used in this report.  Most of the growth in Los Fresnos has occurred outside of the 1.9-mile radius, therefore, although the population has increased, it has not increased 30% within the area in question. \n\nA search of MARPLOT Satellite and Topographic maps did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint.

Los Fresnos Water Treatment Plant personnel employed the HAZOP technique to conduct a Process Hazard Analysis. They discussed each question and recorded their answers. After answering the questions, they discussed the adequacy of the existing safeguards and recommendations for additional safeguards. The staff finished the Process Hazard Analysis with an equipment inspection. All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at least once every five years.  \n\nLos Fresnos Water Treatment Plant ensures that each employee presently operating the process, and each employee newly assigned to these processes have been trained or tested successfully in the operating procedures listed above that pertain to their duties. Annual refresher training provided to each employee operating the chlorination process ensures that the employee understands and adheres to the current operation procedures of the process.\n\nThe Los Fresnos Water Treatment Plant emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can reasonably be expected to occur at the facility. The emergency response procedures consider dangers within the plant that may affect employees as well as dangers outside of the plant that may affect the public or"
