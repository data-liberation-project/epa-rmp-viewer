Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Coastal States Crude Gathering Company's Almeda Facility are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel will be available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We have also coordinated with the Houston Fire Department Emergency Response Team to provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass a Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) Fractionation Plant with LPG processing, storage, and transportation.  We have five regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] and Pentane.  The regulated substances at our facility are components of the LPG feed to the plant, the fractionated product streams, and the gases stored in underground caverns.\n\nThe maximum inventory of each regulated substance at our facility is:\n\nPropane                530,000,000 lb\nIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]    460,000,000 lb\nButane                320,000,000 lb\nIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-]    170,000,000 lb\nPentane                120,000,000 lb\n\n3.

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involve catastrophic releases from two different storage wells in the Almeda Facilities process.  These two release scenarios have the potential to affect different land areas and different public receptors.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the release of 2,150,000 lb of Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 1.04 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nAn additional worst case release scenario involves the release of 1,750,000 lb of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.97 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the Almeda Facilities process, which is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 7,182 lb of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.10 miles.\n\n4.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCoastal States Crude Gathering Company's Almeda Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) and What If.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on December 11, 1995.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Coastal States Crude Gathering Company's Almeda Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Almeda Facility has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Almeda Facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 5, 1997.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Almeda Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed on March 15, 1996.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions, are promptly notified of the modification.  They are also given any training required to safely deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes, and to modifications in established processes, are conducted as a regular practice the Almeda Facility.  The most recent review was performed on September 22, 1998.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCoastal States Crude Gathering Company Almeda Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted was conducted on July 31, 1998.
