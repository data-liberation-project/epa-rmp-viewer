As part of this commitment, COSL has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at these facilities.  One component of this system is a risk management program that is designed to manage the risks at COSL?s facilities.  Additionally, this RMP complies with all requirements of the California Accidental Release (CalARP), and the Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.\n\nThe RMP at COSL consists of three elements:\n1.    A hazard assessment to aid in understanding the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n2.    A prevention program to assist in maintaining and safely operating any processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.\n3.    An emergency response program to help respond to an accidental release of regulated substances from the covered processes.\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Plan (RMP) at the COSL helps provide assurance that the WWTP and WTP facilities are maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of their overall safety program.  In fact, COSL has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against the release of a hazardous substance, and injuries and damage resulting from a release of a hazardous substance.  COSL has a Safety Director who reviews relevant regulations and initiates safety committee walkthroughs.\n\nCOSL has limited its use of hazardous substances at its facilities.  Before using a hazardous substance at COSL, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, COSL consid"

The City of Shasta Lake has limited the use of potentially hazardous substances that are regulated.  The WWTP and WTP facilities are very well maintained.  The facility and process equipment were designed, built, and are being operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards were closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the facilities and equipment.\n\nCOSL limits damage from a release, if such a release should occur.  COSL trains specific employees to respond to an accidental release, in order to reduce the consequence(s) of a release.  In addition, COSL works closely with the Shasta Lake Fire Protection District, which employs three Haz Mat trained firefighters, to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimal, if a release should occur.\n\nThe safety program at COSL consists of a number of elements that conform to CalARP Program 3 requirements.  \n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCOSL is committed to the safety of its workers, the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  COSL implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the facilities; and programs to manage the risks at facilities that store and use hazardous substances.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, COSL and the Shasta Lake Fire Protection District will work to control and contain the spill in a manner that will be safe for the responders and the employees, and wil"

If the power is off for short time, then the auxiliary emergency generator is put on-line to provide power for critical equipment at the WWTP.  At the WTP, there is currently no auxiliary emergency generator but is being discussed for installation in the future.  Automatic shut-off valves are located on the downstream side of the flexible pigtail connection at each cylinder that will shut down the systems upon sensing low pressure in the piping downstream from this valve.  If a release occurs downstream of the vacuum switchover valve (vacuum loss), the valve will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Air-supplied respirators are located outside the Chemical/Electrical Building.\n\nSix one-ton chlorine cylinders and two one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinders at the WWTP are strapped onto the saddle supports that are bolted to the slab (per design drawings).  When transporting a one-ton cylinder from the delivery truck to the Chemical/Electrical Building which houses the chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders (using the monorail hoist system), only trained employees complete the cylinder transfer process, and they adhere to strict guidelines.\n\nThe WTP facility has two one-ton chlorine cylinders that are strapped onto the saddle supports that are bolted to the slab (per design drawings).  Flexible pigtail connections are used and the piping is adequately supported.  The chlorine use and storage room has one chlorine leak detector sensor, an alarm system (with a backup notification system), a ventilation system, and a light that will energize to warn the persons entering the room, if a leak has been detected.  There are no automatic shut-off valves located at the cylinders or on the flexible pigtail connectors.  Air-supplied respirators are located in the breezeway outside the building.  \n\nIn both facilities, the piping"

      "SummaryText": " systems and supports appear to be up to the required standards, and pipe supports are securely mounted to solid structures.  The cylinders are located within areas that will secure them from large objects, which could fall and damage the cylinders or supply system.  Equipment inspections are regularly conducted and recorded by operational staff. \n\nWhen transporting a one-ton cylinder from the storage location to the on-line cylinder area, the valve cover will remain in place, the tank will be loaded and unloaded utilizing the proper equipment, and the cylinder will be set into a saddle support.  Only trained employees will complete the cylinder transfer process, and will adhere to strict guidelines when completing this process.\n\n1.7    Five-Year Accident History (Section 5.0)\n\nCOSL has reported no accidents, personal injuries, or property damage in the last five years, with regard to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas.  If an incident occurs, an investigation team will conduct an investigation following the incident investigation protocol.  The team will suggest improvements to the process and, if appropriate, improvements will be made.  Additionally, a report will be completed and will be kept on file.\n\n1.8    Emergency Response Program (Section 8.0)\n\nCOSL has established a written emergency response program to ensure a safe response to an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for: \n\n?    Fires \n?    Medical Emergencies\n?    Earthquakes\n?    Emergency Spills\n\nThe Shasta Lake Fire Protection District employs three firefighters, who have received Haz Mat training and are on the Shasta County Haz Mat Response team.  These specialists are trained in the use of kits to repair chlorine and sulfur dioxide tank leaks.  All affected COSL personnel and the Shasta Lake Fire Protection District have been notified of the emergency response plan and procedures, which serves as the local emergency response team.\n\n1.9    Planne"
