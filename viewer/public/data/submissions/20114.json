If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Craford County LEPC, local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for fertilizers for crop prodcution nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 127,500 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 60 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.14 miles.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Employee training is performed to insure all employees are trained in their job functions."
