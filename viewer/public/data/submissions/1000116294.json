The accidental release prevention policy at the Greenville treatment facility involves a combined effort between management, operating and local emergency personnel.  The facility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards, review safety techniques, and implement employee training through operation, maintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk of a chlorine gas release.\n\nB. The Greenville treatment facility was originally placed into operation in 1956.  The facility was expanded in 1994.  The facility currently has the capacity of treating 6.0 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous chlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect the effluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers for a total of 4,000 pounds.  The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted and are designed for conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is inspected daily by the wastewater treatment plant operating personnel.  The facility is manned approximately 8 hours per day.\n\nC. In general, the Greenville Treatment Facility's accidental release prevention program is based on the following:\n\n- Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n- Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n- Preparation of written operating procedures for safely conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n- Implementation of employee training program\n- Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, Aqua Pennsylvania, Inc. performs compliance audits as needed and when equipment or processes change.  Written documentation of the audit will be maintained on-site.\n\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ch"

A summary of the investigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained at the treatment facility.\n\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the appropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection device, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and a ton-cylinder repair kit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees relative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine gas.\n\nD. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nE. The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Mercer Countys written emergency response plan.  Release response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation procedures and training exercises are included within the plan.  The public is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as soon as a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within the plan.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility emergency coordinator.\n\nThe Greenville Treatment Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include the local fire department, police department, emergency medical service and HAZMAT team.\n\nAqua Pennsylvania, Inc. (Aqua) operates a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located in the Borough of Greenville, Mercer County, Pennsylvania.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: Aqua committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas including design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and employee training associated with the regulated process at the facility.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled: The facility utilizes chlorine for disinfection before wastewater is discharged. The fac"

The chlorine is stored in an enclosed room that is constructed of concrete block. The chlorine injection system has been designed to incorporate numerous safety features to prevent, detect and respond to leaks.\n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps: The facility had an established accident release prevention program that complied with EPA RMP Prevention Program 2 as required with the following elements:\n\no Safety Information\no Hazard Review\no Operating Procedures\no Preventative Maintenance Program\no Contractor Evaluations\no Incident Investigation\no Employee Participation\no Training\no Compliance Audits\n\nAqua will either delist upon inventory reduction or report on its Program 3 management system implementation, which began upon assuming ownership, by completing a full RMP Submittal within 6 months.\n\n4. Five-year accident history: The facility has not had any reportable releases of chlorine in the past five years under prior or new ownership.\n\n5. The emergency response program: The written emergency response plan will assist facility personnel in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials. The emergency response program is based on both on-site and off-site emergency actions. The emergency response program includes all aspects of emergency response including on-scene first aid, evacuations, internal response capabilities, external resources, notification and reporting procedures. The LEPC and local fire department is invited to the facility annually for a review of the hazards at the facility.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: The facility continuously evaluates the established procedures and equipment in order to operate the chlorine system in a safe and responsible manner."
