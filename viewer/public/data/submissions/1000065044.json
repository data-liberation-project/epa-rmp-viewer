Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our\r\nuse.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous\r\nmaterial.  Gordon Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees\r\nand the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as\r\nindustry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have\r\na Process Safety Management program to help us operate and maintain the system safely. Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\r\n\r\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\r\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards and to identify appropriate changes to improve safety.\r\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\r\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\r\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to ver"
