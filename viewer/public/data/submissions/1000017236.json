              "Description": "The CPVC resin unit uses chlorine as a primary raw material. The resin plant operates under the Louisville facilityA?s comprehensive program for process safety management inclusive of both engineered and procedural/administrative systems to prevent releases of hazardous chemicals. These systems are consistent with and fully compliant with the elements established in OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Standard, 1910.119. Some highlights of the program include:  1) Employee Participation A? Employees with various areas of expertise are involved in numerous activities to continuously improve plant safety systems and results. Key areas include safety committees, audits, pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analyses, training, procedure development and safety meetings. 2) Process Hazard Analysis A? Various process hazard analysis techniques are utilized to identify and critique the potential hazards associated with plant processes. Recommendations are developed and implemented following evaluation. PHAA?s are updated a minimum of every 5 years. 3) Operating Procedures A? Operating procedures have been developed for all plan processes to ensure safe operation. These are updated as required and are reviewed annually for correctness. 4) Employee Training A? An operating training program has been established to train, test, and qualify employees involved in operating the chemical processes. The program includes plant specifics, process-specific and job specific training. All employees have completed this program and are re-qualified every three years. 5) Mechanical integrity A? The resin area follows a comprehensive mechanical integrity program for equipment in chlorine service. Elements of this program include inspections and tests at prescribed frequencies and documentation thereof, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel. 6) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews A? Reviews are conducted of new processes, major projects and new chemicals to ensure safe transition into the operating mode. 7) Hot Work Permit A? The plant follows a long-standing system to manage potential sources of ignition throughout the plant. 8) Management of Change A? A system is in place to properly manage changes that are not A?replacement-in-kind.A? 9) Contractors A? Contract companies are evaluated to ensure they have the appropriate job skills, knowledge training and certifications to perform work safely. All contract personnel must complete a Lubrizol Louisville-specific training class prior to entering the facility and annually thereafter. \n10) Incident Investigation A? All incidents or near-miss incidents involving the release of hazardous chemicals are investigated by a multi-functional team of plant personnel including those involved in operating the process. These reviews involve a critique of incident and any related plant systems. Corrective actions are developed and tracked to completion. 11) Compliance Audits A? Internal audits of our process safety management systems are conducted by Lubrizol personnel every three years. These audits review all systems and documentation thereof; the audits verify process safety information and inspect the physical facilities.\n\nMany safety controls have been engineered into the resin process. Computer interlocks provide multiple layers of protection. Back-up for these interlocks is provided via hard wire shutdowns for safety-critical process parameters. These systems are continually reviewed for improvement opportunities during routine investigations of minor releases and/or near-miss incidents, PHA re-validations, and as part of the management of change system.",

      "SummaryText": "The Lubrizol plant in Louisville, Kentucky is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in the Rubbertown area. A portion of this plant, along with several in the vicinity, began operation in 1942 as a government-owned synthetic rubber facility. Thus, the name Rubbertown was established.\n\nFrom 1942 until February, 2001, the current Lubrizol facility was owned and operated by The BFGoodrich Company and from 2001 to 2004 by Noveon, Inc. In 2010 Lubrizol acquired an adjacent PVC manufacturer's Plant site once Oxy Vinyls ended all production on site.  Oxy Vinyls had supplied Vinyl Chloride monomer (VCM) to Lubrizol and the acquisition of the site allows for continued unloading and storage of VCM for processing in the latex unit.  Today, the facility operates as an integral part of Lubrizol Advanced Materials, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Lubrizol Corporation. Over 100 different products are produced at the Louisville facility. The latex unit supplies products consumed in paper coatings, automotive interiors, and non-woven cloth applications. The facility is the worldA?s largest producer of CPVC resins and compounds which are consumed in the manufacture of plumbing, fire sprinkler and industrial piping systems.\n\nThe plant utilizes four chemicals regulated under the EPA Risk Management program RMP Rule. These are vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, which are regulated as flammables, and chlorine and vinyl acetate, which are regulated as toxics. The systems required by the RMP to prevent serious accidents and to plan contingencies have long been in place at this facility. The relationship between excellent chemical safety programs and good business is well understood in the Lubrizol organization and is a core value in our operation. The RMP initiative provides us with an additional opportunity to expand our ongoing dialog with the community.\n\nThe Lubrizol Louisville facility is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the surrounding c"
