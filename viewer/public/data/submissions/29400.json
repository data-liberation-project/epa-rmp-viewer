      "SummaryText": "ateeco operates a facility in Shenandoah, PA under the name Mrs. T's Pierogie's which produces pierogies and related products.  The facility produces pierogies, freezes them, and distributes to customers in various States.\n\nMost large refrigerated facilities use a chemical called anhydrous ammonia as a vital part of the refrigeration system.  Ammonia performs the same functions as the hydrochlorofluorocarbon - Freon refrigerants used in home air conditioners, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. Ammonia is the most environmentally friendly, energy- and capital-efficient refrigerant available for industrial applications; Freons are not suitable for many industrial uses.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used widely as a fertilizer, both for direct injection into the ground and for manufacture of other fertilizers.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, it is considered a hazardous material.\n\nMrs. T's is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community; we have done so for many years.  This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system.  To further safety in our facility,we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we implement a method called Process Safety Management to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained safely.\n\nWe use a variety of methods to ensure that accidental releases of hazardous materials are prevented to the greatest extent possible.  In addition to professional design and installation to accepted engineering standards, our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing: \n    Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropr"

      "SummaryText": "is ever found.\n    Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed worst-case and alternative hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this Risk Management Plan.  The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or risk of these incidents.  Mrs. T's uses other methods to develop plausible scenarios for emergency planning and response drills.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves loss of the contents of a high-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes.  As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.   The alternative scenario involves lifting of a relief valve, a safety device provided on all vessels to prevent accidents such as the one specified as the worst-case.  The alternative scenario also has offsite impact.  We estimated that the release would end after ten minutes, a plausible value considering the normal behavior of relief valves and ammonia in vessels.\n\nWe used a computer program supplied by the Environmental Protection Agency to estimate the offsite impacts.  (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years\n\nMrs. T's relies upon the efforts of community and contract emergency response personnel to respond to any serious accident at the facility.  We support the efforts of the Schuylkill County Emergency Management Agency and other County emergency organizations by providing information and technical assistance."
