Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations continue to be performed to access the conditions of the facility.  Equipment maintenance plans have been established to keep equipment up to date.    Our goal is to prevent injuries due to accidental exposure to NH3.  Preventing accidents keeps employees healthier and more productive. Prevention saves time and money from equipment repair and recovery, injured employees medical expenses and products loss."

The owners, management and employees of Backes and Toelke dba Marthasville Ag are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Keeping employees, emergency workers, and the surrounding community safe is of utmost importance.  We have a plan in place to prevent accidents and a plan on how to respond to emergencies that might occur. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Warren County LEPC, and other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the residents and the environment of our community.  Owners and employees are trained to mitigate the situation and are prepared to handle the best response of an accidental release in order to recover the product safely and keep the community safe as well.\n   \n2.  Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.  We transfer the NH3 from the storage tank into nurse tanks that are delivered to the farm where product is being applied in the ground.\n\n3. Accident Release Prevention Program. This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OHSA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.   We assess security vulnerability and implement protective measures necessary to meet DHS defined risk bases performance standards. \n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  We have no accidental releases to report.\n\n 5.  Emergency Response Program. Our facility has coordinated with the local responders (fire department has toured facility annually to familiarize themselves with our location.)
