The twelve (12) elements are recognized as being fully implemented and integrated into the standard operating practices of the plant.  Summarized below are brief descriptions of each of the elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information: Critical information on chlorine properties, chlorine production techniques, and chlorine handling is made readily available to facility personnel through Material Safety Data Sheets, current drawings, and comprehensive operations procedures.  Equipment specifications and vendor manufacturing information is used for equipment and system designs.  Additionally, the Chlorine Institute provides information and guidelines in the form of regularly updated technical pamphlets.  This information is used while conducting PHA?s and PSSR?s and is the basis for developing our operating procedures and chemical process systems.                                                    \n                  \nProcess Hazard Analysis: The facility performs Process Hazard Analyses on an established schedule for RMP/PSM processes.  A trained team with a certified PHA Leader performs PHA?s on the RMP process and other process nodes not regulated by the standard.  The recommendations are then prioritized and implemented accordingly.  A system is in place to assure recommendations are followed through completion.\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating instructions have been developed by teams of experienced personnel for all RMP operations.  The operating instructions are maintained and annually reviewed and signed as being up-to-date.  Changes to Operating procedures are tracked through the Management of Change process.\n\nTraining    Pioneer?s training program is designed to train operations and maintenance p"

The program also provides ongoing training and refresher courses to continually enhance the capabilities of all plant employees.  Training in operating procedures is confirmed with a written test and ?walk-through? of the process.  All training is documented.\n\nMechanical Integrity: The Mechanical Integrity program is designed to ensure that plant equipment is maintained in/at the minimum designed specification and operates according to assure a viable condition.  Pioneer has a documented inspection program that enhances the integrity of critical equipment and systems in the plant.  Trained maintenance personnel ensure that all equipment and systems involved in chlorine service are maintained and inspected on an established schedule.  Recommendations from equipment inspections are then prioritized and implemented accordingly.\n\nManagement of Change: Written procedures are in place to ensure that all process changes at the plant undergo several levels of review at the planning stage.  No changes in the PSM/RMP areas are made without a review by a management team that includes operations and maintenance personnel.  Systems are in place to assure that communications of the changes will be made to all affected personnel before changes are implemented. \n\nPre Start Up Reviews: New or modified systems are thoroughly reviewed by a team composed of a cross section of plant employees before the systems are placed into service.  This review process is designed to ensure appropriate engineering design, adequate safety systems, and sufficient training has been identified and a mechanism is in place to assure recommendations are completed before start up.\n\nCompliance Audits: On a schedule of every three years, a third party performs PSM/RMP audits.

The findings are documented and communicated to facility personnel.  The plant embraces the Total Incident Reporting System to assure that all potential incidents are captured and addressed in a timely manner\n\nEmployee Participation: Employee participation is the cornerstone of the Voluntary Protection Program.  Plant operators, maintenance technicians, and engineers, as well as supervisors and managers participate fully in Hazard and Operability Studies, procedure development, training and incident investigations.  A broad range of facility personnel also make up the safety committee and participate in a wide range of safety related activities.\n\nHot Work & Work Permits: The facility?s Hot Work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition.  The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained in the EHS department.  The plant has implemented other work permits to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel\n \nContractor Safety: The contractor safety program places stringent qualification requirements on contracting firms before entering into the plant to perform work.  Contractors  provide training documentation of their employees that meet or exceed the requirement of the job scope.  Contactors participate in an industry supported 24-hour safety certification and then site specific orientation before being permitted to work in the facility.

The plant responders are trained and qualified on the proper response techniques for the chemicals associated with the facility and are equipped with the necessary equipment to perform critical response procedures.\n\nAs part of the ongoing training program for responders, routine drills are conducted.  These include both tabletop planning sessions as well as full field responses to simulated incidents in the plant.  Additionally, Pioneer conducts joint drills with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness and works closely with that office to coordinate emergency response actions.  Pioneer is also an active member of the Geismar Area Mutual Aid group, which provides equipment resources for emergency response from other area facilities.\n\nThe plant is equipped with a facility-wide alarm system.  When the alarm system is activated, response teams assemble immediately; including those assigned the task of making critical notifications.  Current emergency phone numbers are maintained in the control room of the facility and in the Emergency Action Plan, which is immediately available in several critical areas of the plant so that timely notifications can be made.\n\nThe facility-wide chlorine-monitoring network has monitors stationed at key locations though out the facility. These monitors can detect chlorine at low concentrations.  Operations personnel monitor the real-time readings from the chlorine sensors and will respond immediately to any detection.  Additionally, the facility utilizes a computer modeling system that can help to plan potential scenarios and develop appropriate responses.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL MODELS\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility?s largest storage tank, assu"

While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning.  The computer-generated model for our largest chlorine tank results in a planning zone of 25 miles.\n\nFacilities must prepare an alternate scenario that ?could have an off-site impact?, based on plant operations.  The Alternate Scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weather conditions.  The Alternate Scenario for this facility is the rupture of a loading line while actively loading a chlorine rail car.  For planning purposes only, it is assumed that the safety check valve on the rail car does not engage.  The computer-generated model for this release results in a possible impact of up to 1.3 miles.\n\nIt should be noted that the plant did have a failure of a loading hose occur, and the check valve on the railcar worked properly preventing a RMP incident.  Less than 6% of the amount modeled for the alternate scenario was actually released.  As a result of this incident, additional safeguards have been implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of this incident.\n\nFIVE-YEAR HISTORY\nIn the past five years, there have been no incidents at the plant as defined in the plant?s RMP/PSM program.  If an incident would occur, as per the procedure, a thorough investigation would be initiated to determine the causes of the incident.  In addition, the incidents would be reported to the appropriate agencies.  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nPioneer believes that continuous improvement is the key to success in the future.
