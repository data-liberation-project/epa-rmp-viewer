The nearest residence abuts the north property line.  There are no schools or hospitals within three miles of the site.\n\nCurrently, there are 42 full-time BVPV Styrenics employees working in manufacturing, technology and administrative jobs at the site.   \n\nThe Painesville site is a global leader in the production of plastic resin for polystyrene foams.  The major product is expandable polystyrene.\n\nThe BVPV Styrenics Painesville site's approach to chemical safety is best described by the BVPV Styrenics Responsible Care (Safety, Health, Environment, Security and Risk) Policy Statement, that begins with the following statement and goes on to list ten guiding principles of conduct: BVPV Styrenics is committed to being a leader in achieving and maintaining superior Responsible Care performance.\n\nWe operate on the premise that all accidents and incidents are preventable.\n\nWe fulfill this policy commitment through the application of a comprehensive Responsible Care management system that ensures:\n\nIdentifiable Responsible Care risks associated with BVPV Styrenics businesses, operations and products are assessed and successfully managed.\n\nEffective loss-prevention programs are in place and physical assets are protected.\n\nSafety, health and environmental laws, regulations, and permit requirements are followed or exceeded.\n\nAppropriate policies, programs and procedures are in place and continuous employee learning opportunities are available.\n\nBest available science, technology and industry practices are being applied with due consideration given to economics and technical practicality.\n\nOrganizational responsibilities are clearly defined, understood and carried out and every employee is responsible a"

Pentane is used to produce expandable polystyrene resin (EPS) that is manufactured at the site.  Our resin is in bead form and is sent to customers that mold the beads into end products (i.e., packaging or insulating materials).\n\nPentane is piped through a closed system from a 40,000-gallon storage tank into vessels in the process area.  Pentane is potentially used during two parts of the process, initially during bead formation then occasionally later during the drying stage as a paste applied to the beads to provide lubrication for customer processing.  Pentane is delivered to the site in rail cars.  Pentane vapors are collected during the process in a spherical gas ball and sent to one of two boilers for destruction. \n\nWorst-cas"

      "SummaryText": "e release scenarios\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified end point.  At the Painesville site, the only regulated substance used on-site is pentane, which possesses the characteristic of flammability.  The Worst-Case release scenario requirement for flammables considers liquids at ambient temperatures and the amount of those liquids that becomes vapor in the first 10 minutes of the release.  This is used to determine the endpoint during a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nApplying the worst-case scenario definitions at Painesville, the following information was derived:\n\nWorst -Case Scenario: \n\nWorst-case scenario involves a release of the maximum quantity of pentane contained in an unmitigated railcar on-site (170,500 lb).  The release of this amount of pentane, coupled with a vapor cloud explosion, would result in an estimated distance to 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure of 0.4 miles.  RMP Comp Version 1.07 was the technique/software used to determine the overpressure end point.  On the basis of this distance and considering the population density of Painesville Township, Ohio, it is estimated that there would be 533 residential receptors in this area (mostly north of the facility).  There are no environmental receptors in this area.\n\nAlternative Release Case Scenario\n\nThe processes involving pentane at the site were studied to develop the alternate case scenario. The facility utilized the knowledge of the process operators and engineers to develop an alternate case scenario that would have the greatest likelihood of occurring.  This scenario involves the failure of a 4-inch railcar unloading hose.  The area where this would occur has a passive mitigation system consisting of drainage to a gravel dike area where it is possible a vapor cloud fire may occur.  The scenario involved passive and active mitigation (including avai"

      "SummaryText": "lability of equipment to stop the release and foam suppression), involved a release of approximately 12,120 pounds of pentane with an RMPComp estimated distance to end point of <0.1 miles.  This scenario does not involve any off site consequences.  A more likely scenario involving off site consequences could not be found.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nTo prevent the situations described above from occurring, these processes are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  All 14 elements required under the PSM rule are in place at the site and have been integrated into the prevention plan requirements under the Risk Management Program.  Compliance with the PSM rule provides the foundation for compliance with the Risk Management Program.\n\nSome of the specific prevention measures in place include the following: \n\tPresence of pressure relief systems on storage tanks. \n\tDikes surrounding storage tanks. \n\tOn-going equipment inspection programs to monitor mechanical integrity.\n\u00b7Tanks protected by firewater deluge systems with foam available for vapor suppression in the pentane tank dike. \nArea classifications that guard against the introduction of ignition sources into the process areas.\n\tPresence of hydrocarbon sensors and alarms to detect pentane releases.  \nContinuous monitoring of pentane-unloading operations by operations technicians and frequent facility inspections as part of facility security requirements.\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Painesville site involving pentane in the last 5 years.  In fact, pentane has been used at the site for more than 30 years without any major off-site incidents.\n \nTo further improve site safety and emergency preparedness, the Painesville Site coordinates its emergency response plan with the Painesville Township Fire Department (PTFD) and the Lake County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).  The site conducts annual pre-plan tours and response drills in conjunction with the PT"

Additionally, the site conducts process hazard reviews every 5 years with the last review started in 2021.  \n\nThe only changes made to this submission over the previous submission pertain to number of employees at the site (42 versus 46), an ownership change from NOVA Chemicals to BVPV Styrenics the date of our last process hazard review (2016 versus 2011). Note: Revalidation started at the end of 2021 and is currently being audited by a Third Party related to PSM Applicability and the Initial HAZOPs.
