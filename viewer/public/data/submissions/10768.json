A table summarizing the reference documents\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The gas plant ensures\nthat the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown\nsystems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design\nand construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination\nwith written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that\nsafety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Crescent gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Crescent gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to\nperform these evaluations.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Continental Natural Gas Crescent plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\ntraining personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of\nour processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Crescent gas plant, located near Crescent, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids, propane and condensate) from natural gas.\nThe Crescent gas plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and natural gas liquids.\nThere are no regulated toxic substances at the Crescent facility.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level\n3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest storage tank containing 50,000 gallons. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage\ninventory to 30% of the maximum tank capacity; therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to\nrelease and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is\n0.37 miles. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their\nconsequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this\nWCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Crescent gas plant is a VCE\nresulting from the release of 1500 gallons (7296 lb) from the propane storage area.The maximum\ndistance to the I-psi endpoint for this event is 0.16"

Figure 1-1 graphically presents the hazard\nassessment results for the flammable WCS and ARS events.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Crescent plant.\nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by' the Environmental Protection Agency's\n(EPA's) risk management program (RAMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety\nand Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary\naddresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to\nimplement the accident prevention program.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Crescent gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\nmanagement and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and\ncompiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process\nhazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\naccident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention\nprogram are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and\naddresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of\ninitiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives\ninclude forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.

In addition, the Crescent gas plant evaluates contractor safety\nprograms and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically\nmonitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPro-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Crescent gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a\nchange in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features,\nprocedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the\nequipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The\nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification\nthat accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Crescent gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels,\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown\nsystems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting\ntraining, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting\nidentified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities\nform a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health\nhazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe\nwork practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator\nto learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\ndemonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own,\nthey can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the\noperating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\nThis refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for\neach operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors\n\nThe Crescent gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities.
