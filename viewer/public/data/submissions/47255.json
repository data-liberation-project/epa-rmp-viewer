      "SummaryText": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe MEP Pleasant Hill, LLC, Aries Power Project (Plant) maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the RMP rule threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  The Plant will store the anhydrous ammonia in a 18,190 gallon tank with an administrative policy to not fill the tank beyond 80% capacity (i.e. 75,670 pounds).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used at the Plant as an air pollution control system additive, to minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion turbine flue gas emissions.  The Plant is a combined cycle plant, consisting of two combustion turbines with heat recovery system and a common steam turbine generator.  Each combustion turbine is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. The anhydrous ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment are addressed in this Risk Management Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe Plant is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (codified in 29 CFR 1910.119) because it stores greater than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  As such, the facility is required to prepare a PSM plan.  The requirements of a PSM plan and RMP prevention program are essentially equivalent, and this RMP will also serve as the facility PSM plan.\n\n\n\nPlant Description\n\nThe Plant is located in Cass County, Missouri, at 25111 E. 175th Street, Pleasant Hill.  The facility is located approximately 1.5-miles west of downtown Pleasant Hill and 1-mile east of the intersection of State Highway BB and E. 175th Street.  The property immediately surrounding the power plant is unimproved or used for agricultural purposes.  The topography is generally hilly with small pockets of woodlands along fence rows and hollows. \n\n\n\nAmmonia System Description\n\nAn ammonia unloading and storage system is composed of four (4) major components: a tanker truck unloading station, ammonia storage tank, ammonia vaporization skid, and SCR equipment.

      "SummaryText": "anker truck unloading station is designed to provide a safe means of linking the ammonia delivery truck to the storage tank for the transfer of ammonia.  One 18,190-gallon horizontal tank is provided for anhydrous ammonia storage. The tank is situated in a concrete secondary containment berm.  A pressure regulator on the vapor outlet line of the storage tank maintains an outlet pressure of 30 ? 60 PSIG at a flow rate of 25-244 lbs/hr to the SCR systems.  In the event that the ambient temperature outside the tank falls below a temperature that will generate enough heat to provide the 25-244 lbs/hr flow rate the SCR system requires, an ammonia vaporizer skid provides additional heating to keep an adequate vapor supply at the top of the storage tank.  Ammonia vapors drawn from the tank are regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the combustion turbine flues within each respective ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the SCR unit, nitrogen oxides are reacted and emissions of the pollutant are reduced.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was identified as the loss of the entire 18,190-gallon tank in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development.  The ammonia would be released as a gas.  As allowed in 40 CFR Part 68.25 (b)(1) of the RMP rule, administrative controls such as the company policy to fill the tank to a maximum of 80% liquid by volume, were taken into consideration in the evaluation of the mitigation of this release.  The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The area of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp, modeling software provided by the EPA. \n\n\n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis indicated that the ammonia would travel approximately 4.9 miles under the specified weather conditions "

Within this radius from the ammonia tank, an estimated 10,860 persons could potentially be affected.  Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section.  \n\n\n\nThis type of rapid release would occur only if the ammonia tank were breached.  The likelihood of such an incident occurring is miniscule.  Anhydrous ammonia tanks are installed with multiple safety systems to precisely prevent the release of an entire tank in a single event.  There have been no incidents of ammonia tank breaches reported in the nationwide EPA ? Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office database.  \n\n\n\nAlso, in the event of a release, it is highly unlikely that the ammonia would disperse in a radial pattern given the weather conditions in Kansas City.  During a release, it is expected that an ammonia plume would disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind at the time of the event, as opposed to covering the entire area defined by a circle with a radius of 4.9 miles.      \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case.  Engineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves, check valves, relief valves, ammonia vapor leak detection system and alarms and water fogging system are considered in the analysis.  \n\n\n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a major leak in the liquid piping network between the storage tank and the vaporizers.  As a conservative estimate, the rate of release was assumed to be the maximum flow rate that would not cause the tank liquid excess flow valves to automatically shut.  The leak was assumed to continue until the sounding of the ammonia vapor detector alarm, at which time the operator would be alerted to check the ammonia sys"

Within this radius from the ammonia tank, an estimated 10 persons could potentially be affected in addition to plant employees and contractors.  Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\n\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the ammonia system using a Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) type safety review.  The ammonia tank and associated systems were reviewed for compliance with the American National Standards Institute standards for ammonia (ANSI K-61.1 ? American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section VIII, Division 1.
