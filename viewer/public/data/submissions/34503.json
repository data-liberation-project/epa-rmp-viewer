The primary use of ammonia is in the air pollution control system for the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides.  It is also used for process corrosion control. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Carson Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and operating procedures to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  In addition, the refinery has a number of programs underway that address employee safety issues, including a comprehensive program for behavioral safety.  This program provides training for each employee to enable them to observe fellow employees in order to identify and correct behaviors that may lead to accident or injury.  Developed and managed by our employees, this peer review program is a well supported by our employees and is a fundamental part of our safety program.  Other ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in written programs maintained"

Conducting business in a manner that wins public confidence and meets the environmental and economic needs of the communities we serve is critical to our long-term success.  \n\nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities, as well as in the training or our employees.  Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have trained personnel who will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on our surrounding community.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery is located in the city of Carson, California.  The site occupies 630 acres and employs more than 1000 people.  The refinery has to capacity to process approximately 265,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce a variety of petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and petroleum coke, as well as products such as propylene, natural gas liquids and other petrochemicals.  The facility also includes the Watson Cogeneration Unit and ARCO Polypropylene Plant.  The Watson Cogeneration Unit is a joint venture between BP West Coast Products LLC and Southern California Edison.  The Cogeneration Unit burns natural gas to produce electricity, which is sold to the Edison grid.  Waste heat from the process is then used to supply steam to the refinery for process use.  The Poly"

This documentation addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response information is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) contained in Operating Manuals and Design Process Books.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

Critical procedures such as unit emergency procedures are reviewed annually during annual training sessions.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Carson Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining a process.  Initial training for operating and maintenance personnel who are new to a process includes health and safety training, fundamentals of refining, process overview and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is given to operators assigned to an operating unit.  This training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the operator\u00bfs job tasks.  Job specific training includes on-the-job training, a written manual, written tests, observations, and written sign-off.  The Carson Refinery also has ongoing refresher and supplemental training for all personnel.  Testing is conducted for all job specific training and craft qualification for each level of progression.  Once an operator is qualified in a position, they are required to recertify for the job every three years by comprehensive testing.  Testing is also conducted on all OSHA-required safety and health training.  Employee training and certification records are documented, both in hard copy and computerized training records.\n\nContractors\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities, or to perform tasks requiring skills that are needed on a non-routine basis.

The hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents involving accidental release or potential for such, engineering and administrative controls and failure of such, and human factors will be addressed by the team performing the hazard analysis.  The findings and recommendations of the team are submitted to area management to assess the likelihood of the potential hazards, assess the severity of the consequences from potential releases, and assign priority for implementation of recommendations.  The recommendations and progress towards implementation is followed using a computerized tracking system.  The final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Carson Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) unit emergencies and emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, and 6) initial startup of a new process.  \n\nThe operating procedures are currently available to anyone working in or near a process area at the appropriate process unit control rooms or through area supervisors.
