EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155 \n\nThe City of Cocoa Utilities Department operates the City of Cocoa's Claude H. Dyal (Dyal) Water Treatment Plant at 28400 E. SR 520, Christmas, Orange County, Florida.  This plant is one of two water plants operated by the City.  Only the Dyal water plant has quantities of a regulated hazardous chemical, chlorine, above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Dyal Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this plan.\n\n\n\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\n\nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant's prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n\n\n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\n\nThe City of Cocoa has a management system in place which is led by the City Manager.  The City Utilities Director oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  The Dyal Water Treatment Plant Superintendent oversees the daily operation.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's RMP Process Safety Information.  The Dyal management and employees use this program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies.  This eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant. \n\n\n\n1.3.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\n\nThe City of Cocoa maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Dyal Water Treatment Plant.  The prog"

The Dyal plant follows the like elements of the OSHA PSM program.  The City is exempt from compliance with OSHA.  The policies and procedures are maintained by the Water Treatment Plant Document Management System (DMS).\n\n\n\n2.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT CITY OF COCOA, FLORIDA DYAL WTP SITE (B)  \n\n\n\nThe City of Cocoa Dyal Water Treatment Plant employs 53 full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Elemental Chlorine is used as part of the disinfection treatment process.\n\n             \n\n2.1.    SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)    \n\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Cocoa and managed by its Utilities Department.  The site is located at 28400 E. SR 520, Christmas, Orange County, Florida.  The 62-acre site is located in an area bordered by SR 250 on the east, South Taylor Creek Rd on the west and private property on the north.\n\nThe Dyal Chlorination system includes two separate rooms.  One for chlorine storage and feeding chlorine from the ton containers.  Chlorine under vacuum is feed to the second control room where the chlorine is metered through chlorinator units and fed to the various remote injections points.   \n\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulations:  the Bulk Chlorine Storage and feed systems associated, vent makeup, exhaust systems, chlorine scrubber, and chlorine injection cabinets at various injection points.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of Dyal's Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\n2.1.1.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The City of Cocoa chlorine process was installed as part of the process of p"

      "SummaryText": "urifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ton containers of chlorine are received, stored and distributed to water treatment process control systems. \n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 48, one-ton containers.  This equals 96,000 pounds.\n\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n\n\n3.1.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the environment and the public. For chlorine, the distance to a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population to public receptors that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios \"worst case\" and \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system.\n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".  This scenario was determined by the PHA HazOp team.\n\nAtmospheric dispe"

The three ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distances was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\n\n\n3.2.    WORST CASE (C) (1)\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA's RMP Comp Program.  Results demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint of ** miles containing ** square miles of area assuming an urban topography without an enclosure (** this data is kept in the plants process safety information.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is one individual based on the U. S. Census 2010 demographic data.

However, there are actually **residences within the radius.\n\nNote, items with an ** are redacted per EPA protocol.\n\n\n\n3.3.    ALTERNATIVE CASE (C) (2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the whip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03-square inch hole in the wip tube, a pipe, or even the ton container itself.

Receptors in this area were identified.\n\nThe City has improved the safety system by installing and emergency shut down valve on each ton container.  Therefore if a leak occurs the chlorine detections alarm system causes the emergency valves to close and the scrubber to come on.  \n\n\n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\n\nThe City of Cocoa's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM/RMP program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall water division wide program and second is the Dyal site-specific program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Orange County Fire/Rescue Department (including the Haz Mat Team) and the Regional LEPC.\n\n\n\n4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\n\n\n\n4.1.1.    Facility Design\n\nThe chlorine storage area is housed in a closed building.  Its doors are closed and locked requiring an entry key.  The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design code standards and good engineering practices.  The storage and control building rooms are equipped with forced ventilation systems.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the storage room.  If chlorine is detected in the storage room, the monitor "

It also starts the building chlorine vent fume scrubber and the scrubber is capable of neutralizing over 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the water plant control room. \n\n\n\n4.1.2.    Equipment Design\n\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible (not corroded by chlorine) steel pipes, copper tubes or non-metallic materials.  Ton containers are rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is 150 psig giving a 3-to-1 safety factor.  There are two sets of six ton containers on each high pressure line.  An emergency shutdown valve (ESV) is connected directly to the ton container top angle valve.  All of the ESVs will close if a chorine monitor detects one ppm of chlorine in this room  That alarm signal also starts the chlorine vent scrubber.  Both the ESVs and vent scrubber can be operated manually.  The ESV discharges to an angle valve and flexible whip.  Each whip leads to a header which feeds into an automatic vacuum pressure regulator which switches chlorine from the empty line to the standby line.  This one bank is in service and the other is on standby.  Chlorine from the high pressure system feeds the low pressure system.  The chlorine in the high pressure system can only reach 140 psig if the temperature of the tons reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  This provides a large safety factor.  \n\nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches or more of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line goes above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system piping is PVC.  It has glass and other material that are not"
