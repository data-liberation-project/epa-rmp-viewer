Glo-Tex produces acrylic polymers in both emulsion polymerization and solvent-based reactions.  This utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, six of which are listed as toxic materials in 40 CFR 68.130.  Of these four chemicals, two of them are planned to be on site in quantities that exceed the threshold planning quantity, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate.  The other four chemicals, formaldehyde, ammonia, epichlorohydrin and hydrochloric acid greater than 37%, are kept in quantities below the threshold planning quantities.\n\nAcrylonitrile\nAt Glo-Tex, acrylonitrile is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.  Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of acrylonitrile include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.  At high doses acrylonitrile can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for acrylonitrile is 20,000 lb.  Glo-Tex uses acrylonitrile as a raw material in polymerization reactions and stores a maximum of 10,000 gallons (66,753 pounds) in its monomer tank farm. \n\nGlo-Tex had an accident involving a reportable quantity of this material on July 21, 2006.\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\nVinyl a"

Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of vinyl acetate monomer include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.  Liquid or vapor may cause irritation of the eyes experienced as stinging, excess blinking and tear production, with excess redness in the conjunctiva.  At high doses vinyl acetate can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The RMP threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for vinyl acetate monomer is 15,000 lb.

Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of ammonia include eye, mucous membrane and systemic irritation by inhalation. .  At high doses ammonia can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, and possibly other routes.  The threshold quantity for ammonia is 20,000 pounds [40 CFR 68.130].

Among those consultants were process specialists, process control specialists, and environmental, safety and health specialists.  The process specialists assisted with the specification and installation of replacement equipment including specifications for the relief device sizing and equipment arrangement to reduce the potential for future incidents.  Process control specialists assisted with the specification and installation of process control computers, process instrumentation, and writing process control code to provide alarms and interlocks.  The environmental, safety and health specialists assisted with the process hazard analysis and preparation of the various policies and procedures for such things as spill control and management of change.  Facility personnel have instituted a more formal employee participation program, incident investigation, new asset acquisition, new asset installation, and standard operating instructions for the manufacturing process."

A catastrophic release is one that \u00bfpresents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\u00bf  \n\nA team consisting of knowledgeable employees and, as necessary, contractors and consultants should perform the investigation.  The investigation should be started immediately.  US EPA suggests that the investigation begin within 48-hours of the incident.

This requirement requires the facility to develop a written plan to implement employee participation.  The employees must have access to PHAs and all other information required by the RMP regulation.\n\nSafety is of utmost concern in any facility that handles hazardous chemicals.  Glo-Tex has a written Hazard Communication Plan that may be found in Section 6 of the Safety Manual.  Training of new employees and additional training and reinforcement of policies with all employees focus on hazardous materials safety, hazard communication process safety, and fire and emergency evacuation procedures as well as specific job related tasks.  Key activities such as loading and unloading of tank trucks utilize written procedures to minimize the risk of accidents.  Training centers on the Hazard Communication Plan and the basic safety rules that all employees must follow (reference Glo-Tex Safety Manual and Employee Handbook).\n\nEmployees and supervisors from the production department were included in the development of the Process Hazard Analysis.

If the employees do not respond to releases of regulated substances and if the local public responders are not capable of providing such response, the facility must take steps to ensure that effective response is available (e.g., by hiring response contractors). \nFor purposes of Part 68, \u00bfresponse\u00bf has the same meaning as that term has under OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER Standard. OSHA defines emergency response as \u00bfa response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders ... to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\u00bf \n\nGlo-Tex does not designate employees for response other than to address \u00bfincidental releases of hazardous substances where:\n\u00b7\tthe substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel or \n\u00b7\tclean-up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.\u00bf  \n\nThese actions are not considered response under OSHA or Part 68; therefore, Glo-Tex is a \u00bfnon-responding facility\u00bf [40 CFR 68.90(b)].

Glo-Tex plans to continue periodic training with the fire department as necessary to assure that an appropriate emergency response will be made.\n\nFor \u00bfnon-responding facilities\u00bf, EPA has adopted a policy similar to OSHA in its Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) [29 CFR 1910.120].  This allows these facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan provided that they coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\n \nCoordination with local responders also entails the following:\n\u00b7\tIf the facility has a covered process with a regulated toxic substance, it must be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA regarding a response to a potential release.\n\u00b7\tIf the facility has a covered process with a regulated flammable, it must ensure that the local fire department is capable of responding to a potential release and aware of its responsibility to do so.\n\nTo document the requirements, the facility should have a record of: \n\u00b7\tThe emergency contact (i.e., name or organization and number) that would be called for a toxic or flammable release, and\n\u00b7\tThe organization(s) that would assist with response procedures.\n\nGlo-Tex operates in a manner that attempts to minimize hazards associated with the handling of chemicals.

Maintenance procedures are included in the preventative maintenance schedules.  A preventative maintenance schedule has been developed for each piece of equipment at Glo-Tex and each month a list of required preventative maintenance activities is printed out and employees are notified of assigned tasks.  For preventative maintenance activities that require a greater frequency than once per month, a checklist is provided and these tasks are completed on the schedule stated.
