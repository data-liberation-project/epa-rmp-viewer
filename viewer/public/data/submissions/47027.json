Glo-Tex produces acrylic polymers in both emulsion polymerization and solvent-based reactions.  This utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, six of which are listed as toxic materials in 40 CFR 68.130.  Of these four chemicals, two of them are planned to be on site in quantities that exceed the threshold planning quantity, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate.  The other four chemicals, formaldehyde, ammonia, epichlorohydrin and hydrochloric acid greater than 37%, are kept in quantities below the threshold planning quantities.\n\nAcrylonitrile\nAt Glo-Tex, acrylonitrile is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.  Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of acrylonitrile include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.  At high doses acrylonitrile can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for acrylonitrile is 20,000 lb.  Glo-Tex uses acrylonitrile as a raw material in polymerization reactions and stores a maximum of 10,000 gallons (66,753 pounds) in its monomer tank farm. \n\nGlo-Tex had an accident involving a reportable quantity of this material on July 21, 2006.\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\nVinyl a"

The procedure for mechanical integrity is found in Section 22 of the Safety Manual.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe market for the polymers and gums that are made by Glo-Tex changes rapidly.  In many instances, products are tailored for specific applications and must be formulated and manufactured.  Glo-Tex?s R&D and Production Departments confer prior to manufacturing any new product.  A portion of the discussion concerns the potential for adverse impacts including releases, especially those that would produce odors.  Glo-Tex is sensitive to odors because the threshold of odor for the acrylate compounds is much lower than any concentration that would affect health.  Glo-Tex documents the discussions regarding new products in a batch sheet that outlines the steps in the manufacturing process.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures are developed for each new product to provide the operators wi"

The R&D Department develops a process designed to safely scale the production up from 1-liter reactors up to full production sized units.  The Management of Change procedure creates a written record that addresses scale up issues for new products.    This procedure assures that the products can be safely made.\n\nThe potential for adverse effects due to changes to process equipment is also considered by reviewing revised P&IDs.  These evaluations are generally documented in a meeting record, memorandum, an ISO procedure, or some other appropriate form.\n\nA management of change procedure has been developed to address the three types of changes that may occur at Glo-Tex.  These changes are:\n?    Change in SOP or introduction of new SOP\n?    Addition of new equipment\n?    Reconfiguration of existing equipment\n\nThe management of change procedure can be found in Section 23 of the Safety Manual.\n\nPre-Startup Review\nPrior to beginning production of any new product formulation, the product is made in bench scale sizes and usually in one or both of the pilot scale reactors in the Process Department.  This ensures to the extent possible that the product quality will meet the requirements and no adverse conditions will be created.  \nFor new equipment, a formal start up procedure is prepared with input from the Process Department, the designer, and the persons installing the equipment.  This procedure is reviewed with management prior to startup.\n\nFor new equipment, the purchase and installation of new equipment requires two steps.  The first step is authorization of capital to purchase the new equipment, which includes a process review to discuss the proposed equipment and how it impacts the existing process equipment from an operating procedure and safety standpoint.  The second step is a post construction review to assure that instruments have been properly installed and calibrated, that mechanical equipment has been properly i"

These procedures may be found in Section 23 of the Safety Manual.\n\nCompliance Audits\nGlo-Tex has retained the services of an outside environmental consulting firm to assist with audits of the prevention program.  Formal audits resulting in a written report occur every three years at a minimum and informal audits are conducted more frequently.  The results of these audits are then used to ensure that Glo-Tex operates in a safe and compliant manner and the past two audits are kept on site.  The audit procedure is found in Section 25 of the Safety Manual.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe RMP regulation requires a facility to begin to investigate each incident which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a \"catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\"  A catastrophic release is one that ?presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.?  \n\nA team consisting of knowledgeable employees and, as necessary, contractors and consultants should perform the investigation.  The investigation should be started immediately.  US EPA suggests that the investigation begin within 48-hours of the incident.  The team must prepare a report, which must be retained for five years, containing the following:\n?    Identification of the factors contributing to the incident,\n?    A focus on the root cause as well as the initiating event,\n?    Recommendations for corrective actions, and\n?    A framework to assist management in taking corrective action\n\nThough not required by the regulation, US EPA encourages facilities to investigate all accidental releases. Investigating minor accidents or near misses can help the facility identify problems that could result in major releases if not addressed.\n\nGlo-Tex had an incident on July 21, 2006 that is subject to the regulation.

Glo-Tex has a procedure entitled Incident Investigation that includes assembling an investigation team for all incidents and near misses.  These investigations are documented as appropriate for the character of the incident.  The Incident Investigation procedure may be found in Section 26 of the Safety Manual.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe RMP regulation requires that management consult with the employees on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and other required process.  This requirement requires the facility to develop a written plan to implement employee participation.  The employees must have access to PHAs and all other information required by the RMP regulation.\n\nSafety is of utmost concern in any facility that handles hazardous chemicals.  Glo-Tex has a written Hazard Communication Plan that may be found in Section 6 of the Safety Manual.  Training of new employees and additional training and reinforcement of policies with all employees focus on hazardous materials safety, hazard communication process safety, and fire and emergency evacuation procedures as well as specific job related tasks.  Key activities such as loading and unloading of tank trucks utilize written procedures to minimize the risk of accidents.  Training centers on the Hazard Communication Plan and the basic safety rules that all employees must follow (reference Glo-Tex Safety Manual and Employee Handbook).\n\nEmployees and supervisors from the production department were included in the development of the Process Hazard Analysis.  The stated policy and procedure for employee participation may be found in Section 27 of the Safety Manual.\n\nHot Work Permit\nThe RMP Regulation requires the facility to issue a permit for hot work on or near a covered process.

If the employees do not respond to releases of regulated substances and if the local public responders are not capable of providing such response, the facility must take steps to ensure that effective response is available (e.g., by hiring response contractors). \nFor purposes of Part 68, ?response? has the same meaning as that term has under OSHA?s HAZWOPER Standard. OSHA defines emergency response as ?a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders ... to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.? \n\nGlo-Tex does not designate employees for response other than to address ?incidental releases of hazardous substances where:\n?    the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel or \n?    clean-up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.?  \n\nThese actions are not considered response under OSHA or Part 68; therefore, Glo-Tex is a ?non-responding facility? [40 CFR 68.90(b)].  A call was placed to the Spartanburg County Emergency Preparedness office (864 595-5365) and the following information was confirmed.  In Spartanburg County, industrial facilities are effectively included in the Community Emergency Operations Plan coordinated through the Emergency Preparedness office.

The fire chief has authority to call out the hazardous materials response team as he deems appropriate to the emergency conditions.  The facilities are required to provide SARA 312 information and Glo-Tex has had several training sessions with the local fire department to assure that their personnel are familiar with the facility.  Glo-Tex plans to continue periodic training with the fire department as necessary to assure that an appropriate emergency response will be made.\n\nFor ?non-responding facilities?, EPA has adopted a policy similar to OSHA in its Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) [29 CFR 1910.120].  This allows these facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan provided that they coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\n \nCoordination with local responders also entails the following:\n?    If the facility has a covered process with a regulated toxic substance, it must be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA regarding a response to a potential release.\n?    If the facility has a covered process with a regulated flammable, it must ensure that the local fire department is capable of responding to a potential release and aware of its responsibility to do so.\n\nTo document the requirements, the facility should have a record of: \n?    The emergency contact (i.e., name or organization and number) that would be called for a toxic or flammable release, and\n?    The organization(s) that would assist with response procedures.\n\nGlo-Tex operates in a manner that attempts to minimize hazards associated with the handling of chemicals.
