Park Street, Gifford, IL  61847\nContact:  Victoria Warner\nRMP Facility ID: 100000088665\n  \nRMP Executive Summary below:\n \n1.  The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers Ag Service Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\n3.  The worst case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\nThe alternate case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  Farmers Ag Service Inc. complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Equipment and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There has not been accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in offsite evacuations.  A summary of the November 13, 2003 Incident Report is included in Section 6 of this Risk Management Plan.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  Farmers Ag Service Inc. has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities"
