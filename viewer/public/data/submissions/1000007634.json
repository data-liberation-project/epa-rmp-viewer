The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with BayerA?s largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as an industrial park, approximately 35% of the Bayer acreage is developed.  Bayer hosts four guest facilities (Hexion, El Dorado Nitrogen, First Chemical Texas, and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\n\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail and truck and has pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\n\nPrimarily supporting the automotive and construction industries, products manufactured by Bayer Baytown include: \nA?    polycarbonate thermoplastic (used in CD/DVDA?s, auto and optical lenses, medical supplies and sports equipment)\nA?    raw materials for polyurethane foams (used in home and appliance insulation, cushions, and auto trim) \nA?    high-performance coatings (used in automotive, wood, flooring and furniture coatings) \nA?    basic inorganic chemical products, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid,  and caustic, to be used as raw materials in our other processes, and for products for industry\n\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\n\nBayer Baytown has seven processes covered under RMP.  The management team at Bayer BMS - Baytown has designated the site as a Process Safety Management site.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level and are considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management.\n\nThere are five chemicals that are used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities as defined in the RMP regulations:\nA?    Ammonia\nA?    Chlorine"

No covered flammable compounds are used at the site.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe site is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) is intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. The PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Bayer Baytown site.  Action items identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.  Involvement of personnel in the OSHA-VPP program has been exceptional.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll site personnel have access to the companyA?s electronic mail system and Intranet.  Chemical-specific information (Material Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHAA?s) are conducted in each process unit.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHAA?s.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.  Improvements in process control systems and safeguards are outcomes of the PHA process.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures addressing normal and abnormal operating situations are in place and implemented.

The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\nTraining:\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of their unit and that they understand the necessary actions for non-normal situations.  Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.  A safety steering committee and safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety; the safety of the Bayer facility and its employees is maintained. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.  Findings are addressed prior to startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to ensure that maintenance workers understand how to perform their duties safely to maintain the facility.  Specific instructions for testing and inspections are included.  Testing and inspections are conducted as scheduled and documented.  Maintenance and engineering follow established codes, standards and company guidelines.\n\nHot Work and Control of Abnormal Activities:\nControl of hot work and non-normal situations is conducted to ensure that work does not contribute to or cause hazardous results.  All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.  Non-routine work is controlled through multi-disciplinary teams who anticipate what may occur during the execution of the work and prepare appropriate plans to prevent/mitigate the situations.\n\nManagement of Cha"

Root causes are identified and documented.  Changes in the system are made to prevent recurrence.  Incident reports are readily available to assist other areas in preventing similar occurrences.  Findings from investigations are followed through implementation and completion.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nBaytown conducts site-wide compliance audits every three years of the PSM-RMP program.  An audit team made up of hourly employees, supervision, and contractors conduct these audits.  Deficiencies are documented and corrected in a timely manner.  Open action items are tracked through completion.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Programs \n\nAt Baytown, accident prevention programs are required in each process.  Specific prevention programs include:\n\nDetection Systems:\nDetectors are in place for various toxic vapors (phosgene, chlorine, etc.) and for hydrocarbons.  Personnel wear dosimeters in the plant.  A Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program is in place.

A run-away reaction in the Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) manufacturing unit overpressured a process vessel.  There were 17 OSHA recordable injuries and 22 first aid cases.  Ammonia was released.  There were no off-site impacts from this incident.  The process was thoroughly investigated and numerous improvements incorporated into the revised operations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBayer Baytown maintains a trained emergency response team on site at all times.  Each shift has an emergency response team with up-to-date training.  There are emergency medical technicians on each shift and an ambulance and fire truck staged for their immediate use.  An auxiliary trailer has additional equipment (air bottles, escape equipment, etc.) for immediate access during emergencies.\n\nThe emergency team includes members who have completed requirements for hazard materials (HazMat) response. Equipment for emergency HazMat response use has been prepared and staged at this facility.  \n\nThere is a designated organization which responds during daytime emergencies and off-shift emergencies.  The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has equipment (maps, warning systems, P&ID drawings, MSDS, etc.) and supplies to direct the response.  The EOC is equipped with an emergency response modeling system to estimate the potential effects of a release on other areas of the facility or the community.

Community outreach efforts are currently underway in all communities in the vicinity of the Bayer facility.  BayerA?s role in the community emergency action plan is documented in the community procedures.\n\nThe Bayer facility has also been an active participant in the Baytown Citizens Advisory Panel to address concerns of the citizens regarding their proximity to manufacturing sites.  The City of Baytown is notified of all plant level alarms as an information source to citizens.  Through the East Harris County Manufacturers Association, Bayer participates in recording messages on a CAER line for information and emergency notification purposes.  The Bayer facility posts updates for the community in the event of an emergency or significant activity at the Bayer facility.\n\nThe Baytown Plant Managers Network represents the manufacturing sector of the Baytown area.
