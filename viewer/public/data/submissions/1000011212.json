      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Navajo Refining Company's Lovington, NM refinery are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Petroleum refining.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane, IsoButane and Propane.  Butane, IsoButane and Propane are distilled from the crude oil feed, stabilized, then transported offsite via pipeline as a combined stream.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Butane at our facility is 15526 lb., IsoButane is 6179 lb. while Propane is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 7624 lb.\n\n3. The Worst Case \nRelease Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the potentially impacted distances for each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  This was selected as the basis for the calculations since it generally predicts distances on the high side as compared to more sophisticated models.  Scenarios evaluated included both chemical-specific releases and releases of mixtures.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nLight Ends qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst case scenario for this process 29329 lbs. of Flam. Mix.: Propane, Butane and IsoButane is released.   It is assumed"

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.29 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  This distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.  \n \nSince this is a program level 1 process, no alternative release scenario is required.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The refinery has an active program in place to maintain compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nNavajo maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all Lovington refinery processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If or HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/09/2008.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Lovington refinery maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, tempor"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nNavajo's Lovington refinery has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nNavajo's Lovington refinery carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Navajo Refining Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed on 02/03/2006.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Navajo's Lovington refinery.  The most recent review was performed on 09/25/2009.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to"

The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 12/06/2006.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nNavajo Refining Company promptly investigates any incident at the Lovington refinery that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nNavajo Refining Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Navajo Refining Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes at the Lovington refinery.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.

Emergency Response Plan\nNavajo Refining Company has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nOur emergency plan has been coordinated and verified with Lea County and City of Lovington personnel.  This includes the Lea County LEPC when it is active.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nNavajo Refining Company plans to continue improving and enhancing our already effective safety program at the Lovington refinery.  This established successful system is already in place to prevent and respond to accidental releases.  Furthermore, no potential offsite consequences have been identified.  Therefore, it is not surprising that no new courses of action have been identified by the Risk Management Plan.  However, the ongoing process whereby Navajo reviews and evaluates new information will continue to result in ever improving refinements to our existing Safety Program."
