Additionally, TI maintains a written emergency response program and trained emergency responders to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.    \r\n\r\nThe prevention program focuses on hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance activities and formalizes these practices into our ESH management system that is both Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001- and International Standardization Organization (ISO) 14001-compliant.\r\n\r\nHazard Analysis\r\nA formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted to assess the upset conditions the equipment may present, the controls in place, and the adequacies of these controls to prevent events with high or catastrophic potential. The analysis is a combination of a What-If assessment and a Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) to determine and evaluate the potential hazards.  \r\n\r\nProcess Controls \r\nNumerous process controls have been include in the design and operation of the equipment associated with the chemical processes covered by the PSM/RMP Rule including, fenced site with controlled access, controlled and limited access to the bulk chemical storage area, closed circuit camera monitoring of the bulk chemical storage area, water misting / vapor suppression system for HCl which is automatically activated, UVIR fire sensors and area chlorine monitoring devices, emergency exits with panic hardware, lightning protection and building reference ground protects the facility from lightning and static discharge, trailer Bays each equipped with trailer ground and tie down points, 24/7 supervised fire alarm panel, spill containment d to contain the quantity of stored liquid and fire water, all fittings (valves, connections, etc.) on chemical container and lines are in an exhausted enclosure, exhausted enclosures are continuously monitor"
