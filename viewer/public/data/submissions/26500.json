Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Andover Manufacturing Center of The Gillette Company (Gillette, AMC) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Town of Andover Fire department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacture of personal care products (e.g. aerosol deodorants, antiperspirants and shave preparations; solid deodorants and antiperspirants).  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], Propane and Difluoroethane (Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-].  All of the regulated substances at our facility are used in the production of personal care products.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane [Propare, 2-methyl] at our facility is 220863.65lb while Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], Propane and Difluoroethane [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] are present at our facility in quantities of 98905.88lb., 67094.80lb and 45110.46lb., respectively.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's"

      "SummaryText": " Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have also employed  Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chose scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Tank Farm in the A-31/152A Storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 136698.36lb. of Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.41 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank Farm in the A-46 Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a fireball.  The scenario involves the release of 118897.68 lb. of Propane in ten minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s) and excess flow valve(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.4 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank Farm in the AB70 Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a fireball.  The scenario involves the release of 94257.19 lb. of Propane in ten minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.4 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank Farm in the A-31/152A Storage.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.4 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted from Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank Farm in the Blowing Agent Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a fireball.  The scenario involves the release of \n131874.51 lb. of Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] in  ten  minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s).
