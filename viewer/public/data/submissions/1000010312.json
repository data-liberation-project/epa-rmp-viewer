This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facilities processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Enterprise Neptune Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.
