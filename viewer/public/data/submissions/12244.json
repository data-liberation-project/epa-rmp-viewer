This commitment is demonstrated by the amount of resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control and contain the release to minimize impact to our employees and the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Refining Company (SDPRC) is located in Deer Park, Texas along the Houston Ship Channel some 20 miles east of downtown Houston.  SDPRC operates a variety of processes to produce such products as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, heating oil, propane, butane, asphalt, petroleum coke, and chemical feedstocks.  The Refinery has several regulated flammables, such as butane, butene, isobutane, pentane, isopentane, and mixed flammables throughout several process units.  In addition, the Refinery uses chlorine in some of its processes and stores epichlorohydrin (ECH) for use at our neighboring Chemical Plant.  Chlorine and ECH are regulated toxic substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS -WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe facility performed off-site consequence analyses of accidental releases of regulated substances to estimate potential affects to the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternate release scenario\".  SDPRC does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in place to prevent such a scenario.  The alternative release scenarios that have been developed are bas"

These have been shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to assist them in improving the community emergency response plan.  \n\nSDPRC participated with local industry in delivering the risk management plan message to a broad-base of community through industry open houses, speakers programs, newspaper stories and newspaper advertisements.  SDPRC continues to address RMP with the local emergency planning committees.\n\nDistances to toxic and flammable endpoints were calculated based on the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA standard for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview. III program was utilized to estimate the number of persons living within this distance from the location of the potential release point.  USGS maps were used to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.  The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by SDPRC:\n\nChlorine -  RMP Toxic Substance;  Worst-case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" involving a toxic substance at this facility would involve the catastrophic failure of one ton cylinder of chlorine.  This scenario assumes a maximum inventory of chlorine would be released and evaporates within a 10-minute period.  Under the EPA defined worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would potentially travel 1.3 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 3ppm. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit is taken for passive or active mitigation in the analysis. Potential public receptors include schools, residences, and industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.

The expected amount discharged would be released over a 10-minute period.  Active mitigation accounted for in the analysis includes operator intervention to close the valve(s) and isolate the leak.  No credit is taken for passive mitigation.  Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, the expected amount of chlorine discharged would travel a sufficient distance to go off-site and affect some industrial neighbors, but would not affect residential areas before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 3ppm. There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point. The EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants document was used in evaluating this scenario.\n\nEpichlorohydrin -  RMP Toxic Substance; Alternate Release Scenario\n\nAn \"alternate release scenario\" for epichlorohydrin (ECH) involves a failure of a 3-inch storage tank discharge line inside the tank dike.  This line failure results in an epichlorohydrin spill into the tank dike. Credit is taken for passive mitigation (e.g. the dike walls).  Under the EPA alternate release weather conditions, this release would travel 0.19 miles before the concentration diminished below the ERPG-2 concentration of 20ppm. There are no public or environmental receptors within the area potentially affected by the spill. The EPA OCA Guidance document was used in evaluating this scenario.\n\nPentane - Worst-case Scenario\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" involving a flammable substance would involve the catastrophic failure of a pentane storage tank.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, SDPRC has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issue.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Refining Company maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help sustain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining this process safety information up-to-date.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their locations is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment conside"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameters Document.  The Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Shell Deer Park Refining Company (SDPRC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSDPRC primarily uses a hazard evaluation technique called hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as incident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes it is necessary.\n\nThe HAZOP team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of corrective actions to respond to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All corrective actions taken in response to the PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  T"
