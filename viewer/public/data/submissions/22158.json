This plant expansion increased the anhydrous ammonia usage above the threshold for RMP.  However, we were not required to submit an RMP by the set deadline of June 21, 1999 because we were not above the threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal helath as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use anhydrous ammonia combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided by the manufacturer of the ammonia refrigeration system, as well ass the training of our employees.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is cold storage/warehousing by refrigerating storage room via ammonia system.  The refrigeration system supplies cooling  and freezer areas throughout the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is mostly a gas, but is also liquified under pressure in the storage vessel which is lcoated on the roof of the motor room.  This liquid ammonia is condensed and cooled through the utilization of the refrigeration system.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system at any one time is 25,000 pounds.\n\nOur employee (maintenance) conduct proper start-up procedures as listed in the manufacturer's Opertion & Maintenance manual for the refrigeration system.  These personnel also review the operati"

The maintenance tasks performed are visual inspections conducted daily, visual inspections conducted weekly, preventative maintenance conducted twice per year, as well as yearly preventative maintenance conducted yearly.  Any actual system maintenance (i.e. valve or seal changes) is completed as needed.  The mechanical integrity of the system is completed by keeping a listing of parts recommended by the manufacturer for change-out if and when needed.  P&H Refrigeration is the local refirgeration contractor who helps to insure that all maintenance and system change-out is completed properly.  The refrigeration technician on staff assists in the mechanical integrity and general maintenance up-keep of the system.  The facility has a Process Safety Management Plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program Requirements.  They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication program, Confined Space Program (if needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  These programs, along with the Process Safety Management Program comprise a huge portion of Batesville Cold's prevention portion.\n\nThe emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  P&H Refrigeration Hazmat Crew,  Batesville Fire Department and the Independence County LEPC will be requested to assist Batesville Cold if a release occurs from this location.  If an anhydrous ammonia release occurs at the 3054 East Main location, employees will notify Maintenance Supervisor (Wayne Stewart) of a release, and personnel will  get organized for an emergency action/response and possible evacuation of the facility and surrounding affected areas.

If this action does not stop/mitigate the release of ammonia, emergency response and evacuation procedures will begin.  This facility utilizes the buddy system to ensure that personnel working at this location are accounted for if evacuation is necessary.  The 911 call should have been made by this time to notify other emergency response agencies (Batesville Fire Dept., and Independence County LEPC)  to assist in the mitigation and evacuation procedures.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the refrigeration system (storage vessel failure) for anhydrous ammonia.  This would be a release of 25,000 pounds of ammonia gas/vapor into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, however, in a worst case scenario, all efforts and devices would fail.  This release would result in a distqance to endpoint of 2.5 miles. The area surrounding the location is considered rural based on the low number of obstructions in the immediate area.  The terrain surrounding the facility is hilly, but in the best interests of the cummunity, the worst case scenario determined the area to be rural terrain.  The worst case scenario would impact approximately 3500 persons.  This information was determined by the use of RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was completed for this facility based on an estimated release which could occur.  This release would be an equipment failure (anhydrous line).  This would be an 1/4 inch anhydrous line on the roof of the facility.  Because the line leak would be located on the roof, the release would last for 20 minutes at 180 psi and at 100 degrees F, with a total anhydrous release of approxinately 720 pounds of anhydrous.

These requirements, along with required written programs, will aid in the prevention of a release from the facility."
