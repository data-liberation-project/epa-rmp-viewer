The Holcim facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The Program 1 processes under the CalARP exclusively include the Toluene Diisocyanate Storage Tank and Isophorone Diisocyanate Storage Tank.  Isophorone Diisoyanate is not a listed chemical under the EPA RMP program. TDI is the only chemical handled by Holcim that is listed on the EPA RMP chemical list and is included in this RMP submission.\n\nThe Holcim facility is a manufacturer of Elastomeric Coatings and Sealants. Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate are used in the formation of polyurethane sealants and coatings.  For modeling purposes, the largest vessels (the storage tanks) containing Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate were used.   The maximum capacities of the storage tanks are 10,000 gallons Toluene Diisocyanate and 10,000 gallons Isophorone Diisocyanate.  The results from the worst case modeling for TDI was used in the RMP submission to EPA.\n\nEmergency Response Policies:\nHolcim's emergency planning policies include the development of an emergency action plan, which addresses emergencies such as a fire, earthquake, and hazardous material release that may occur at the facility. Periodic training on the plan is given to employees, and the training includes identification of hazardous areas to avoid during an emergency and the assignment of wardens to assist fellow employees during an evacuation.  Plans are reviewed as required to ensure all information is accurate.  Periodic drills are conducted to ensure all employees understand th"

Facility maintains a PM schedule to ensure equipment operates properly.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThere have been no RMP/CalARP-applicable releases of Toluene Diisocyanate or Isophorone Diisocyanate at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Program: \nHolcim facility submits a Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) to the Orange County Fire Department annually in order to coordinate with the local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that in an event of an emergency they are properly prepared and have knowledge of our systems.  Holcim also maintains an Emergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan on file at the site.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nHolcim is extremely diligent in the handling of Toluene Diisocyanate and Isophorone Diisocyanate. Holcim is committed to continuously improving all safety and environmental policies/procedures.   Holcim has implemented the STOP program to help mitigate any potential issues.  Third party consultant has been contracted to visit the facility quarterly to inspect the site, review programs and conduct employee training.  In the event of a release of either chemical, no Toluene Diisocyanate will travel offsite or reach any sensitive receptors."
