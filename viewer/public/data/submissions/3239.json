If you\nare interested in this information, please contact our RMP Coordinator at 336-878-4266.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of \nan accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less\nthan the endpoint distance, the effect would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n7 When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would not experience any long-term \nhealth consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who \nare particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n7 When considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the \nblast.  Windows at the distance could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse \nis unlikely.  People could be seriously injured by being knocked down by the force of the blast, by flying glass, or by falling objects.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and to ensure safe operation \nof our facility.

We use the orientation \n    meeting to familiarize contractors with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be \n    working.  We provide copies of our Contractor Safety Training Program, which contains plant safety rules/policies, safe \n    work practices, a material hazard summary, and an outline of emergency actions for contractors.  We make MSDS's \n    available for our hazardous materials that may affect the contractor work area, copies of plant safe work practices and \n    policies, and emergency response actions associated with the contractor's work.    \n\n    We require our contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:\n\n    o Train each of their employees in the work practices necessary to safely perform the contracted work\n    o Provide each of their employees with the same safety orientation that we provide for contractors and supervisors\n    o Train each of their employees on our plant's safe work practices\n    o Document that each of their employees has received and understands the training noted above \n    o Ensure that each of their employees follows our plant safety rules and safe work practices \n    o Report to our staff any hazards created or found by their employees at the job site\n    o Provide information on contract employee job site injuries/illnesses to our designated representative\n\nAdditionally, High Point Chemical has instituted"

The following is a brief summary of \naccidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nNo releases of RMP-covered chemicals have occurred from High Point Chemical in the last five years that have resulted in deaths, \ninjuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or \nenvironmental damage off site.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHigh Point Chemical Corporation maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public \nsafety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, \nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance in accidentally releases.  The procedures address all \naspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting \nfor personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and \npost-incident clean-up and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to \nperform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on \nmodifications made to High Point Chemical's plant processes or the High Point Chemical plant facilities.  \n\nWe coordinate our emergency response plans with local emergency planning committees and other emergency response officials, \nproviding all of the information they request for inclusion in community emergency response plans.  High Point Chemical has \naround-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire \ndepartment).  This provides a means to notify the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as "

In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, High Point Chemical conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and \nemergency response organizations, and provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards \nand regulated substances in the High Point Chemical plant.\n\nThe following are some examples of coordination activities:\n\n-    Membership in the LEPC and Industry Forum, providing positive feedback for emergency planning and response directly \n    between industry and emergency response agencies.\n\n-    Implemented and coordinated an Emergency Response Drill, simulating a leaking Ethylene Oxide rail car.  This drill \n    involved responses from the LEPC, SERC, fire department, emergency medical technicians, and the High Point \n    Chemical HAZMAT Team.  This drill, the largest in Guilford County for several years, demonstrated the cooperation and \n    quick response between all agencies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to \naccidental chemical releases:\n\n-    High Point Chemical will implement all Process Hazard Analysis recommendations.  These recommendations will be \n    implemented in a timely manner. \n-    All hazardous process, whether or not they are covered by the RMP regulations, shall be evaluated with the same strict \n    guidelines as those that are.
