Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAssociated Grocers is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our prevention program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release.  This program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the St. George Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAssociated Grocers is a grocery distribution facility.\nThe regulated substnce handled at this plant is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant cooler and freezer system.\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at this facility is 55,000 pounds.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program an dthe specific prevention steps\n\nAssociated Grocers believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards.  By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate in optimum condition.  Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits.  Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safety of Associated Grocers.\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\nIn the last five years, the Associated Grocers facility has not experienced a significant accidental ammonia relea"
