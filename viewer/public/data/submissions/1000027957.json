If an accidental release\n\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate\n\nany release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 120,000 lbs in an 30,000 gal tank.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na) The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gal tank released\n\nas a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 lbs, which represents the\n\nvolume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the\n\nendpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nb) The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history(or most likely potential incident) is\n\na release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1\n\nmiles.\n\n4. The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the\n\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\n\nhandling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na) This is a new facility with no accident history.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n- The facility has:\n\na) provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as\n\nrequired under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\nb) a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, i"
