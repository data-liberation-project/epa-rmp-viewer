YCUA`s objective is to maintain a Process Safety  Management Program. This will aid YCUA, it`s  employees, and Emergency Responders in their efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could leak into the surrounding community and / or the environment. This can be done through written operating procedures, mechanical integrity of equipment, incident investigation, and of course Emergency Planning and Response. Our plan is offensive in nature. This would include emergency ventilation shut down,Technican level hazardous material and Incident Commander Certification, and notification of our Local Emergency Planning Commision (LEPC). The Cl2 disinfection process itself has prevention systems in place that include a pressure reducing valve system, internal diaphragms, and lead gaskets that minimize leak possibilities. The CL2 gas is directed to the proper chlorinator via routing valves which are lableled for each system / chlorinator/ injector. A spring - diaphragm pressure regulating valve will only open if vacuum is correct. The CL2 Evaporaters which could feed liquid CL2 have been removed from the building.  The CL2 tanks are clearly marked  for contents. The hoist used to transport cylinders is inspected on a routine basis. A control room with a detection alarm annunciation panel with critical system checks is monitored on a 24hr basis. A self generated test is performed every 24hrs. The electrical system has a NEMA 4X rating (corrosion resistant). There is back-up power available if needed.",

This would include emergency ventilation shut down,Technican level hazardous material and Incident Commander Certification, and notification of our Local Emergency Planning Commision (LEPC). The Sulfur Dioxide building is attached by a common wall to the CL2 building. This chemical process plus storage is 75% LESS  than CL2. Their are (2) tanks in the process at any one time, one is reserve and the other ton cylinder is on line. Each of these tanks are connected to a separate feed manifold by a flexible connecting whip sealed with a lead washer. These manifolds are connected to an \" Automatic Swich-over Vacuum Regulator- Check unit \" which allows the reserve tank to go on line when the primary tank runs low, preventing interruption in the SO2 chemical feed system. The automatic switch-over units feed into a common line that can feed one (or both) \" V- Notch\" Sulfunators. The #1 Sulfonator feed rate is 0-200 lbs/day, the #2 feeds 0-100 lbs/day. These can be controlled automatically by Electric Flow Proportional Controllers and Electric Actuators. The feed from these Sulfunators is injected into a carrier of Plant Effluent Water (through an Anti-Siphon Injector) which is injected into the plant flow at the former Chlorine Contact Chamber.",

      "SummaryText": "Ypsilanti Community Ultilities Authority ( YCUA )  recognizes it`s responsibility for the safety and health of it`s employee`s and the surrounding community regarding it`s use of hazardous chemicals in our workplace. This of course, has always  included the environment, but in the last decade the increase to the detail of our duties in these areas have multiplied extensively. Our objective is to  maintain a OSHA Process Safety Management Program which in turn has given us the building blocks for preparation  of this EPA Risk Management Program. These programs will aid YCUA and it`s employees in our efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and the surrounding community. Our PSM committee has on file a signed letter of agreement for safety improvement recommendations that concern CL2, SO2 process`s from the General Superintendant (1994), Larry R Thomas. He is now the Director of the Ultilities.\n\nOur Wastewater Treament Plant services 9 separate communities. The average flow of wastewater is 22 million gallons per day. The plant includes five (5) levels of treatment: 1. Pretreament - screening, grit removal, and diurnal equalization which includes detention during heavy storm events. 2. Primary - gravity sedimendation. 3. Secondary - aeration and final settling. 4. Tertiary - rapid sand filters. 5. Disinfection - chlorine contact- 30,000lbs max. / sulfur dioxide- 8,000lbs max. used for dechlorination. The biosolids are removed during the (5) levels of treatment, then dewatered through a filter press. They are then landfilled or incinerated. A pilot biosolid composting project has begun this year(1999). This will allow  us an environmentally conscious alternative to the previousiy mentioned disposal process choices. The facilities primary function is the production of a clean effluent to our receiving streams.\n\nThe worst case release scenario: This was taken out of the EPA-CEPP (RMP Series) Risk Manageme"

This is a 2000 lbs single vessel release in 10 min / 1.3mile toxic endpoint. \n\nThe alternative release scenario: This is the loss of the contents of a one ton cylinder from a major valve problem.\n\nTheir are written operating procedures in place. The building has gas alarms in place. A control room operator that is stationed in an adjacent building on a 24hr basis  also has alarm notification. Ventilation shut-down instructions with active mitigation for any chemical leak that could be contained using existing leak repair kit for one ton cylinders. This kit is a standard issue \" B \" kit that has been made available by the Chlorine Institute. This kit contains devices to stop leaks at the valve and fusible plugs, and in the sidewall of ton containers. The method that was used for offsite impact analysis was also taken directly from Chapter #4 (Offsite Consequence Analysis) of the above mentioned manual.\n\nOur facilitiy falls uder the OSHA PSM standard, Emergency Response Planning and the Community Right -to-Know- EPCRA of 1984 40 CFR. The Mechanical Integrity protocol of the building and the Hazardous Response Technican training the operators and select maintenance personal have received are some of the highlights of our program. Hand held gas detection monitors to complement the existing permanent wall mounted type. Instructional operation guidelines mounted on the walls for safety back-up and plans for future upgrades.\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1982 (17yrs) and has never had an offsite impact.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan contains: The Purpose of EMP - Management`s Role- Description of the Facilty- Site Security- Transportation Routes- Vulnerable Zones- Chemical Information- Summary of Preplanned Emergency Senario`s- Chain of Command list- Instruction Protocol for Emergency Senario`s-Control Room Operator Commands includes public notification and alert system activation- Employee S"

The futures hold new technology. Ultra Violet (UV) Radiation has proven its effectiveness at other wastewwater treatment facilities. we are in the planning stages of a plant expansion. This is to include UV Radiation for use in our disinfection process. Hence the removal of Cl2 / SO2 from our plant site/ and the potential of a Chemical Catatrophe from our employees and our neighbors."
