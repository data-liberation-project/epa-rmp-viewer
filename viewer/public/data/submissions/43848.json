Graham, KY\n\n1    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Dyno Nobel Inc, Graham, KY, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n?    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences that could be associated with accidental chemical releases\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of planned enhancements at the facility to further prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n?    The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n?    The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility consists of two distinct operations: the nitration plant and the detonating cord plant. Our nitration facility produces pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN).  The detonating cord plant produces cords containing PETN, cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and other secondary high explosives.  \nIn our processes, we may have on site the following chemicals, in quantities greater than the RMP threshold amount that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n"
