Peas are processed from mid-June to August, corn in August and September, and carrots and potatoes from early October to mid-November.  Shortly after processing, nearly all of the canned and frozen vegetables are shipped via truck to Seneca warehousing facility located at 308 20th St. SE, Rochester, MN (approximately 8 blocks south of processing facility).\n\n\n\nSenior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but to also maintain safety and environmental programs to promote a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding communities. This is accomplished through the implementation of the EPA Risk Management Program and incorporating Emergency Response capabilities at the facility level.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nAn ammonia refrigeration system is used at the processing facility ammonia is a regulated substance per 40 CFR Part 68 Environmental Protection Agency (Appendix A).  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable coolant for refrigeration also make it necessary to observe certain precautions when using to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Seneca Foods policy to conform to all applicable state and federal rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the refrigeration system is operated, safety devices engineered into the system, good maintenance procedures, as well as the training of our personnel.  The 21,840 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in the system is used to provide refrigeration for the IQF (Individually "

The threshold reporting quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs., thus Seneca's Process Facility is required to comply with the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n\n\nSeneca's Process facility has an accidental release prevention program in place which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (11AR) \"Guide to the Implementation of Process Safety Management (PSM) for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was used to implement the PSM program at the Process Facility.  Parts of the program include:\n\n\n\n     1) Employee Participation\n\n     2) Process Safety Information\n\n     3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n     4) Operating Procedures\n\n     5) Training\n\n     6) Contractor Requirements\n\n     7) Pre Start-up Safety Review\n\n     8) Mechanical Integrity Audits\n\n     9) Hot work Permits\n\n     10) Management of Change\n\n     11) Incident Investigation\n\n     12) Emergency Planning and Response\n\n     13) Compliance Audits\n\n \n\n\n\nIndependent consultants are utilized to assist facility personnel with implementation of our PSM program including:  system audits, PHA development, and employee training.   NewMech Companies Inc. of Plymouth MN performs maintenance on the refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system was installed in 1986, all components were new when installed; no second hand equipment was used.  The system remains in excellent condition as a result of the diligent maintenance program used by Seneca and independent contractors.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the fo"

Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (June 2009 - June 2014), nor have there been any releases that meet the definition specified above.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Rochester Fire Department is the Seneca Process Facility's designated outside first response team.\n\n\n\n If an uncontrolled release develops, the following procedure will be used:\n\n\n\n     1) Freezer mechanics confirms leak\n\n     2) Freezer mechanic evacuates the immediate area\n\n     3) Management determines the need for a plant wide evacuation\n\n     4) An upwind location is selected and the evacuation signal is ordered by the management staff (High-Low Siren)\n\n     5) Time cards are collected for role call\n\n     6) Rochester Fire Department* is notified by calling 911\n\n     7) Roll call is taken at the assembly area and first aid is administered\n\n     8) A list of employees not accounted for at roll call will be forwarded to Rochester Fire Department\n\n     9) Notification of appropriate Company Officials and Governmental Agencies is done\n\n\n\n*= Rochester Fire Department will notify potentially affected offsite parties. A representative of the Rochester Fire Department visits the facility on a annual basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSeneca Foods is continually upgrading not only the ammonia refrigeration equipment but also the written PSM and RMP policies and procedures to stay abreast of industry standards. Some improvements come from the completion of tri-anneal audits while others come from the PSM team. These improvements can include, but are not limited to: Additional training, equipment"
