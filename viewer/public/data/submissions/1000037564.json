      "SummaryText": "Dixie Chemical Company's 50-acre chemical manufacturing facility is located in the Bayport Industrial Complex, 25 miles southeast of Houston, Texas, and operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Dixie is a global supplier of specialty chemicals in three key market segments:\n\n\n\n          Thermoset Materials\n\n          Fuel and Lube Additives\n\n          Alkaline Paper Sizing\n\n\n\nDixie's core chemistry expertise is in functionalizing synthetic and renewable materials through epoxidation, hydrogenation, acrylation, and reactions with maleic anhydride, butadiene, propyleneimine (aziridine), and epichlorohydrin.  Dixie is the only global manufacturer offering a complete line of derivatives based on Diels-Alder and Ene reactions.\n\n\n\nContract chemical processing is also a vital part of Dixie Chemical's operations.  Dixie performs sophisticated custom processing under contracts with other chemical manufacturing companies.  Key features of the facility include:\n\n\n\n          Small to large scale equipment versatility\n\n          Multi-step synthesis capability\n\n          Multi-purpose batch manufacturing\n\n          High efficiency Biazzi hydrogenation\n\n          Thin film evaporation\n\n          Multi-tray distillation\n\n          Crystallization and solids handling capability\n\n          cGMP Protocol capabilities\n\n\n\nDixie utilizes only four chemicals in quantities that require inclusion in this Risk Management Plan: \n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals: epichlorohydrin and propyleneimine\n\nFlammable chemicals: isoprene and 1,3 butadiene\n\n\n\nOf these chemicals, only propyleneimine is manufactured at Dixie's Bayport Facility.  It is sold as a product and is also used as a raw material in another process.  Epichlorohydrin, isoprene, and 1,3-butadiene are used as raw materials.\n\n\n\nEach chemical that is subject to RMP regulations is stored in a dedicated storage tank that is located within a containment area sufficient to contain the volume of the largest tank within the respective area.

The inventories of the raw material chemicals are kept at a minimum between campaigns, thus reducing the risk associated with these chemicals.\n\n\n\nA typical manufacturing operation involves storage of the raw materials in tanks, tanker trailers, or drums; reaction of the raw materials; purification; and packaging of selected product.  Inventories of raw materials, intermediates, and final products are kept at minimum levels to reduce risk.\n\nWorst and alternative scenarios for were calculated for all RMP chemicals used at the Dixie facility:\n\n\n\nToxic chemical (Plant A): propyleneimine\n\nToxic chemical (Plant B): epichlorohydrin\n\nFlammable chemicals (Plant A): isoprene and 1,3-butadiene\n\n\n\nFor each worst case scenario, the entire design capacity of each respective storage tank was assumed to release into its secondary containment area.  Alternative case scenarios were calculated based on smaller releases caused by hose failures, loss of an entire reactor charge, etc.  All scenarios were calculated using RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been updated to reflect one chemical that is no longer used (acrylonitrile) and product lines that have been discontinued (Cardura/Glydexx,4-CCH, and GGE).  All secondary containment areas were re-measured and recalculated for this update and all supporting documentation was updated.\n\nDixie Chemical Company is committed to continuous improvement of Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security (EHSS) performance as well as compliance with applicable legal and industry requirements.  Dixie has an EHSS management system that is certified under the SOCMA ChemStewards program.  All plant operating personnel are required to have classroom instruction as well as equipment specific training prior to being able to work independently in any of the manufacturing areas."

      "SummaryText": "  A Process Hazards Analysis is completed and operating manuals and procedures, all of which meet Process Safety Management regulations, are in place before starting to make any of our products.  A team consisting of production, engineering, EHSS, and research personnel is assigned to monitor the startups of all new production campaigns.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) program ensures the safe startup of any unit or device.  A PSSR \"long form\" is completed for all new installations and processes, while a \"short form\" is completed for all modified processes.  Dixie maintains a rigorous Management of Change (MOC) program to ensure that all changes are properly documented and implemented.  All employees receive training on the MOC and PSSR programs and procedures.\n\n\n\nPrompt and detailed investigations are performed to determine the root cause and to prevent recurrence of every safety, environmental, process, and other incident.  All records are maintained in a customized software package called Dakota Proactivity Suite.  Types of data managed in Dakota include spills, releases, injuries, near misses, and MOCs.\n\n\n\nDixie Chemical has a fully trained and functional Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting primarily of volunteers from operations and maintenance.  Members of the ERT work on rotating shifts so that immediate help is available should an accident, spill, or other emergency occur.  All ERT personnel receive training as specified by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.156, and the National Fire Protection Association standards.  All ERT personnel receive extensive training and participate in drills designed to certify their current level of readiness.  Drills are evaluated to verify proficiency and to identify areas of improvement.\n\n\n\nA plant alarm is in place to alert all plant personnel to any emergencies and Dixie subscribes to an internet-based incident reporting system called e-Notify.  The alarm system and e-Notify are tested weekly.  A Community Awareness/E"
