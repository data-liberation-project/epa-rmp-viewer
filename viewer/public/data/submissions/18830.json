This facility is known as the Kenton Plant and is located on State Route 68 South.  The facility consists of two units.  One manufactures phenolic resins and one manufactures molding compounds.  The facility also conducts warehousing and shipping operations to support manufacturing.  The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs approximately 170 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a)):\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Kenton facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best management practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Kenton facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule.  This also provides the public with a description of the risk management program at the Kenton facility.\n\nThe RMP at the Kenton facility consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment program to help understand: (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances reg"

The prevention programs incldes our Mechanical Integrity (MI), hot works, operating procedures, incident investigation and training (including contractors).\n\n7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of substances, including materials from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Kenton facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in an enviromentally sound and safe manner, it is only one component of the environmental program at the Kenton facility.  In fact, the Kenton facility has a comprehensive environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyChem limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Kenton facility, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Kenton facility, OxyChem reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment. Steps are taken to prevent any such effects through the facility's Chemical Pre-approval, MOC and PHR procedures, which are followed for all new processes or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyChem strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.

Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  OxyChem also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed in an MOC or PSSR (for all changes or new systems) before approval. These reviews inclue EHS, engineering, operations, maintenance and management personnel. In addition, OxyChem requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees (including call-ins) with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. OxyChem's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyChem's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release.  In the event of an accidental release, the Kenton facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  OxyChem utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  OxyChem trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Emergency Response Team which is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental release.  OxyChem has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to assist in emergencies. In addition, OxyChem works with the Kenton City Fire Dept., 911 Review Board, BKP Ambulance Service, Kenton City Police Dept. and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.

The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (' 68.155(c) ):\n\nThe Kenton facility performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario \" and an \"alternative release scenario.\"  In reality, however, OxyChem does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  A catastrophic event, such as earth quake or airplane crashing into the storage tank and no emergency response action would be required for this scenario to occur.  The worst-case and alternative-case release scenario was developed to help OxyChem and local ER groups improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nTrinity Consultants were hired to model the scenarios for a formalin release, including the distance to the release endpoint (ERPG-2).  The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case scenario and typical values in Kenton for the alternative release scenario. The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within this distance from the location of the storage tank.  USGS and City school district maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed for the Kenton facility:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances - Formalin\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" modeled for formalin is the total failure of the Formalin Storage Tank, which would release 840,000 pounds of 45% formaldehyde solution instantaneously, as mandated by EPA.  The reaction rate of formaldehyde to form solid paraformaldehyde and the evaporation rate were calculated by Trinity Consultan"

Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the formaldehyde would travel approximately 0.78 miles before the concentration of formaldehyde was reduced to below 1 ppm (which is the 'endpoint' established in the RMP rule). The U.S. Census indicates that 112 people live within this distance from the storage tank;  The Hardin Co. Airport, residences, commercial facilities and one industrial facility are the only public receptor located within this distance.  No sensitive environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" is the failure of transfer hose while unloading a tanker truck into the storage tank, releasing approximately 500 lbs of formalin liquid in a 2-minute period.   Trinity Consultants also modeled this alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences, which showed that the formaldehyde would not leave the site before the formaldehyde concentration is below 1 ppm (which is the 'endpoint' value established in the RMP rule).  No people live within this distance from the tanker truck unloading area; no public receptors or environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\n\n3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.
