IECO continues to import, store and distribute the regulated substance, CHLORINE, CAS Number 7782-50-5. IECO is located in Guam. Its relevant facility stores and distributes chlorine and employs approximately 21 persons at this location. IECO has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and risk management.  IECO's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the regulated substance.\r\n \r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nAn average of 44,000 lbs of chlorine is stored at the facility, the substance is not used for any processes and no maintenance is performed on the containment vessels on site.     \r\n\r\nRisk Considerations:\r\nAlthough the storage and distribution of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Island Equipment Company has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\n\r\nThe history of IECO (i.e., no RMP-applicable chlorine releases in the last 15+ years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the facility staff in safely storing chlorine.\r\n \r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nA"
