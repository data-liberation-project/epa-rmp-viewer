              "Description": "Island Equipment Company (IECO) Process Safety and Risk Management Program objectives are to prevent the release of chlorine within its facility and outside its facility during the transport/delivery of chlorine and to establish and ensure the safe handling and storage of chlorine for the safety of its employees, the island community and environment.   IECO's Program is a compilation of written plans, training, plan review, and inspections.  To briefly describe, IECO has a designated and secure area for the storage of chlorine.  The chlorine is packaged in 150 pound (lb) cylinders and one-ton tanks supplied from a U.S. mainland supplier.  The average quantity stored at the facility is approximately 44,000lbs.   IECO only imports(U.S.), stores, handles, and distributes/delivers chlorine, IECO does not maintain the chlorine vessels (cylinders and tonners) nor utilizes the chlorine product.  IECO only delivers to known customers, which it reports to the Department of Homeland Security.  IECO has not had an accident or release in the last five years and continues its longstanding track record of safe and compliant operations.  \n\n",

IECO continues to import, store and distribute the regulated substance, CHLORINE, CAS Number 7782-50-5. IECO is located in Guam. Its relevant facility stores and distributes chlorine and employs approximately 21 persons at this location. IECO has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and risk management.  IECO's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the regulated substance.\n\n \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAn average of 44,000 lbs of chlorine is stored at the facility, the substance is not used for any processes and no maintenance is performed on the containment vessels on site.     \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nAlthough the storage and distribution of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Island Equipment Company has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nThe history of IECO (i.e., no RMP-applicable chlorine releases in the last 15+ years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the facility staff in safely storing chlorine.\n\n \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nA"
