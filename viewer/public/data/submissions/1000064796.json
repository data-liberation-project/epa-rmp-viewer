      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nUnilever is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This Program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility.\n\nUnilever senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Unilever's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration systems are administered by the Plant Engineering Manager, who oversees implementation of the risk prevention policies.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nUnilever is located at 27080 W. 159th Street, in New Century, Kansas. The facility employs two independent refrigeration systems that contain anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed System; the Conventional system has a maximum inventory of approximately 28,650 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and the Super-critical Melt Micronisation (ScMM) system, installed in 2014 with a facility expansion, has a maximum inventory of approximately 32,820 pounds. The systems consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment cycle ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing and storage of margarine. Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors. The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors and on the roof of the plant. The relief systems for each of the refrigeration units are also located on the roof.\n\n\n\nThe Conventional ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressur"

Ammonia suction from the MPUs, at about 0 psig, passes through the low accumulator before entering the booster compressors. Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side accumulators and returned as high pressure liquid for the system. The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors. The high side compressor draws suction from the intercooler/high side suction accumulator at about 25 psig (booster discharge). This accumulator receives suction from various cooler units. Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and returned to the system. The major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to seven condensing towers. A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for transferring liquid. A condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air handlers. The liquid is pre-cooled in the intercooler vessel before entering the cooler units and a portion of the MPUs.\n\n\n\nThe ScMM ammonia refrigeration system consists of seven (7) screw compressors that supply high side pressure to the system. The compressed ammonia vapor enters a de-superheater where some heat from the vapor is used to heat production water from 104?F to 140?F. The vapor flows to the evaporative condensers on the roof and is condensed into a high pressure liquid (HPL). The HPL travels to the thermosyphon and the high pressure receiver where the liquid is routed to plate & frame oil coolers integrated with the compressors. The HPL then flows to three surge tanks.  Surge tanks 1 and 2 are used to supply the coolant for the ice water chillers, cooling water to 33?F. Surge tank 3 supplies refrigerant to two plate & frame heat exchanger"

Ancillary equipment for this system includes three oil pots that accompany each surge tank. There are also water-cooled oil coolers that use the heat from the compressor oil to heat production water.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Unilever ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features. Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems. For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary repairs in house, but an outside contractor is contracted as needed.\n\n\n\nThe Conventional ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations at the time of construction as well as ANSI/IIAR-1-1984 and IIAR Bulletin Nos. 109, 110, and 111. The ScMM system was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR2 and ASME codes as applicable. In addition, both systems were designed in accordance with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) standards applicable at the time of construction. ASHRAE publishes a safety code for mechanical refrigeration that outlines requirements for occupancy classification, refrigeration systems classification, refrigerant classification, requirements for refrigerant use, design and construction of equipment systems, pressure limiting devices, pressure relief protection, installation requirements, and field pressure testing.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlo"

Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, transfer vessels, suction accumulators, intercooler, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with overpressure. Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels. In addition, ammonia sensors are located in the Conventional system in Engine Room 1, Engine Room 2, Engine Room 3, Ingredient Cooler, De-palletizing area, and King Units; and in the North Engine Room for the ScMM system. At an ammonia concentration of 50 ppm, the ammonia sensors in Engine Rooms 1, 2, and 3 will activate the audible/visual alarms and trigger exhaust fans to start on \"high\" mode; this activation occurs at 25 ppm in the ScMM system At 100 ppm for either system, the offsite monitoring company is notified who then contacts all employees and/or agencies listed on the emergency contact list. There are also 2% monitors located in each engine room that will automatically shut down the compressor motors at an ammonia concentration of 20,000 ppm. There is also an \"Emergency Stop\" button with a hammer/break glass cover located outside of Engine Room 1 (south of the building) and outside the North Engine Room that, when actuated, kills the control circuit to the compressors, which shuts down the system on auxiliary. The \"Emergency Stop\" button also closes the King Valve and triggers exhaust fans to start on \"high\" mode. The facility also has exhaust fans which are located in each of the Engine Rooms to provide continuous ventilation and emergency (purge) ventilation. There is an on/off switch for the Engine Room ventilation fans located outside of Engine Room 1 (south of building) for the Conventional system and outside the North Engine Room for the ScMM system. The ammonia detector alarms are interlocked to start the same exhaust fans on \"high\" speed. In addition, the facility has developed a preventative maintenance pr"
