The facility has a program for the emergency notification of county government in the event of an accidental release which threatens to go off-site.\n\nThe ammonia is handled in a volume which exceeds the RMP threshhold amount.  There is but one process that handles the anhydrous ammonia:\n\n          1.  Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank, 12,000 gross water capacity, maximum fill @ 85% of capacity\n               (52,000 pounds).\n\nProgram 2 has been select for this facility because we purchase the anhydrous ammonia for our farmer members and distribute it to them as needed as a basic nitrogen fertilizer for their crops.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the release of the entire 52,000 pound contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, which has an off-site impact with a toxic end point of 1.0 miles.  The alternative scenario is a leak from a 2-inch diameter pipe, which has an off-site impact with a 0.60 toxic end point.  The toxic end points are calculated with the DEGADIS air dispersion model.  No active or passive mitigation measures are assumed.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe prevention program emphasizes procedural and managerial steps which enhance maintenance and training.\n\nThe emergency response program consists of: \n\n        1.   A facility-specific evacuation plan, for which employees have been trained, \n        2.   The county-wide emergency response plan with the Fresno County Fire Protection Distr"

Some changes will be made to the physical process due to the results of the inspections performed in conjunction with the preparation of the RMP."
