              "Description": "SuperValu's implementation of the PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change(MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Supervalu has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a component for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Indianola facility. Lastly the PSM Program incorporates the facilities emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire department and other response agencies.

The evaporative condensers \nutilize a combination of water-cooling and multiple-speed fans to transfer heat from the \nrefrigerant to the environment.

The evaporated gas is compressed and condensed into liquid and returned \nto the receiver. \n\n8.4 Recirculators \nThe liquid levels in the recirculators are maintained through float columns and \ninstrumentation.
