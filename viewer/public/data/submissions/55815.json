The evaporated gas is compressed and condensed into liquid and returned \nto the receiver. \n\n8.4 Recirculators \nThe liquid levels in the recirculators are maintained through float columns and \ninstrumentation. From the recirculators, high-pressure liquid ammonia (60 psig) flows to \nthe various air units / evaporators, where it is admitted through flooded and direct \nexpansion evaporators.
