Because of industrial accidents involving releases of hazardous chemicals \neffective process safety management techniques were mandated by the EPA and OSHA to be \ndeveloped by affected facilities. \n\n3.0 PSM Structure \nProcess Safety Management is the application of management principles and systems to the \nidentification, understanding, and control of process hazards to protect employees, facility assets, \nand the environment.

Operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment \ncombinations); \nA? Efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with \nthe degree of cooling required in the various refrigerated areas); \nA?

One or a combination of the base load compressors are \noperated at any time. Depending on the refrigeration needs, additional compressors may \nbe required to move gaseous ammonia to the condensers for the additional refrigerant \nrequirements. When additional compressors are needed beyond the base load \ncompressors 3 and 5 are operationally added to the base-loaded machines during periods \nof increased cooling demand. . \n\n8.2 Condensing \nThe high pressure, high temperature ammonia gas is condensed into liquid using any \noperating scheme of the 2 rooftop evaporative condensers. The evaporative condensers \nutilize a combination of water-cooling and multiple-speed fans to transfer heat from the \nrefrigerant to the environment. The liquid ammonia is collected in the high pressure \nliquid receiver. \n\n8.3 Receiver \nHigh pressure ammonia liquid flows directly from the pilot high pressure liquid receiver \nto the high side recirculator to the low side recirculator. Then ammonia is transferred to \nroom cooling air units (evaporators) where ammonia is evaporated inside coils to produce \nrefrigeration. The evaporated gas is compressed and condensed into liquid and returned \nto the receiver. \n\n8.4 Recirculators \nThe liquid levels in the recirculators are maintained through float columns and \ninstrumentation. From the recirculators, high-pressure liquid ammonia (60 psig) flows to \nthe various air units / evaporators, where it is admitted through flooded and direct \nexpansion evaporators. There, heat energy from the area being cooled is used to \nevaporate the liquid ammonia into a gas. \n\n\n\n8.5 Demand for Cooling (House Suction) \nThe amount of liquid ammonia evaporated is determined by the demand for cooling \nestablished by the set point of the thermostats of the various areas to be cooled.
