AdvancePierre Foods (dba Barber Foods) is committed to operating its Milliken Street facility in Portland, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  AdvancePierre has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  AdvancePierre has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\n\n\nB.  AdvancePierre operates a cold storage and distribution facility at 56 Milliken Street in Portland, Maine.  AdvancePierre's Milliken Street facility is comprised of cold storage, dry storage areas, and a refrigerated loading dock.    Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system to maintain the cold storage area, refrigerated dock, cooler, and tempering room.   The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed-loop system that extends throughout AdvancePierre's facility.  There are three main anhydrous ammonia storage vessels at AdvancePierre, including a high pressure receiver, a storage freezer pumped recirculator, and an intercooler.\n\n\n\nC. The facility is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for anhydrous ammonia processes.  These include programs related to Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nD. There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nE. The facility has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Portland Fire Department and the Cumberland County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for more extensive releases.\n\n\n\nF. The facility has a very strong safety program both "
