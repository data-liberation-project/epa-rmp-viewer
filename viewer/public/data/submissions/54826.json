      "SummaryText": "DSM NeoResins Frankfort facility manufactures products that are sold in the paint and coatings industry. Acrylonitrile is a chemical used in the manufacture of thos products. The chemical is stored in an above ground tank inside a containment dike capible of holding the contents of the entire tank. The chemical is transferred into the manufacturing facility through steel pipes. Because of the amount of Acrylonitrile stored at the facility we are required to comply with the EPA's Risk Management program standard.\n\nAs required by the RMP standard our facility has developed a \"Worse Case Scenario\" to describe the possibility of a release and the impact to the community in the event of such and incident. DSM NeoResins has completed community awareness meetings and includes the local LEPC in all communications or changes. The scenarios used to design the RMP were based on the EPA's OCA Guidance documents and look up tables. The Worse Case Scenario is based on and entire loss of the storage tank holding Acrylonitrile. It was assumed that the material was contained in the holding dike. The dike not only contains the entire spill, but limits the surface area and amount of evaporation. The impact of this type of release reaches and end point of 1.2 miles and includes industrial and residential receptors causing submission of the plan under program 3.\n\nThe results are also that we have 2 possible alternative scenarios. \n\nThe first is an alternative scenario and deals with the release during and off laod of the chemical Acrylonitrile, because of the information from the guidance document the release differs form the Worse Case Scenario. This scenario has an impact of only .20 miles away and only includes industrial receptors. \n\nThe second alternative scenario is based on a release of Acrylonitrile from the pipe that transfers the chemical from the storage tank to the process area. This scenario unlike the first alternate scenario does not have the chemical contained and instea"

      "SummaryText": "d forms a pool on the ground. Because the quantity and release rate are much smaller than the Wrose Case and Alternate #1 scenarios the end point of the release is only 0.11 miles and includes no receptors. \n\nThis facility is also required to follow the OSHA PSM standard and has completed Process Hazard Reviews required under that standard. The facility has organized and trained employees on the emergency response requirements for chemical spills and other safety related incidents. The facility has developed an Emergency Response plan and trains employees on this plan and any changes. The facility also works closely with the community LEPC and State Emergency Planning Commission to ensure good understanding and communication of any and all safety programs, chemicals and storage areas at the site."
