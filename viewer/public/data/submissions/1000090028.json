Lost time incidents have been minimal and training is performed on a routine basis. \n\n\n\n2.0    PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\n\n\n\nGAC Chemical Corporation manufactures primarily inorganic chemicals at its Searsport, Maine, facility.  With regards to 40 CFR Part 68, anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (> 20% concentration) are handled and stored at quantities exceeding the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to produce aqueous ammonia and ammonium sulfate.  No anhydrous ammonia is shipped from the facility.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is received in 80 ton capacity rail cars.  It is unloaded in a closed system using a compressor to remove vapors from the larger storage vessel and pressurizing the rail car with this vapor.  The resultant differential pressure pushes the liquefied anhydrous ammonia to the storage vessel.  The maximum pressure in the anhydrous ammonia system during unloading and storage is 120 psig.  The operational pressure rating for the storage vessel is 250 psig.  The operating plan calls for two to four 80 ton rail cars of anhydrous ammonia at the plant at any one time.  Only one car will be in service at any time.\n\n\n\nTransfers of anhydrous ammonia from the larger storage vessel to either aqueous ammonia production or to the smaller vessel is via small transfer pumps.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia unit started production i"

      "SummaryText": "n May 1995.  Aqueous ammonia is produced by injecting a controlled volume of anhydrous ammonia in a re-circulating flow of unfinished aqueous ammonia.  The batch production process is continued until the desired concentration of ammonia in the solution is reached.  The maximum batch  (limited by the working capacity of the production tank) is approximately 9,000 gallons.  \n\n Finished aqueous ammonia is stored in a 28,400 gallons working capacity tank.  Both of the aqueous ammonia vessels are located in a common containment structure.\n\n\n\nAmmonium sulfate has been produced in Searsport since 1949.  A new modern production unit went into service in October 1992.  The older unit was shutdown in August of 1992.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied to the ammonium sulfate process as a vapor.  The smaller anhydrous ammonia tank is coupled with a small vaporizer.  The combined units are maintained at a constant level to permit steady-state vaporization of the ammonia.  The maximum pressure in this anhydrous system during ammonium sulfate production is 120 psig.  The operational pressure ratings for both the smaller storage vessel and the vaporizer are 250 psig each.\n\n\n\nNo regulated waste ammonia, anhydrous or aqueous, is generated by any handling or processing at the Searsport facility.  The conversion of the anhydrous ammonia in both processes is 100 percent.\n\n\n\nChlorine was used for the first time at the Searsport facility on January 17, 2002, with the startup of a Powell Continuous Bleach Plant.  Chlorine use and Bleach production ceased late 2012.  The production plant was removed December 2012. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nFour regulated processes exist at the facility.  They are as follows:\n\n\n\nProcess 1: Anhydrous ammonia receiving and storage; Process 2: Aqueous ammonia production and storage; Process 3: Ammonium sulfate production; \n\n\n\nAll release scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp for the impact radius calculations and landview III for estimating the affected p"

      "SummaryText": "opulation within the impacted areas.\n\n\n\n4.0     PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nAll aspects of ammonia handling and use at the facility are covered by a Process Safety Management Plan.  The standard operating procedures (SOPs) are reviewed and updated whenever an operational change is made.  If no operational changes are made, the SOPs are reviewed at least every 5 years and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\nMandatory training sessions are attended by all production and maintenance employees.  The subject include annual training of SOPs, hazards communication, fire safety, electrical safety, and pollution prevention.\n\n\n\nGAC supports a fully trained and equipped HAZMAT team to address incidents that may occur at the facility or in the transportation of product shipped from the facility.  Depending on the circumstances of an on-site or transportation incident, a contract responder such as Clean Harbors may be called for assistance.\n\n\n\n5.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN(ERP)\n\n\n\nThe ERP for the facility was first published in April 1991.  It is now part of the facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.  The plan is coordinated with the Waldo County Emergency Management Agency and the Waldo County LEPC.  Copies have been supplied to the Maine Emergency Management Agency, the town of Searsport and the neighboring town of Stockton Springs.\n\n\n\n7.0 PLANS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\n\n\nGAC Chemical has had a solid safety record for many years.  Management continues to place a high priority on the safety and environmental programs at the facility.  Improvements in the programs occur through ongoing review and updates by employees in all areas of production, maintenance, supervision, and management. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                   "
