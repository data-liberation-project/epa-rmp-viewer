Union Carbide Texas City Operations (Texas City) has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets U.S. EPA Risk Management Plan (EPA RMP) and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program (OSHA PSM) requirements.  Key elements include process hazard analysis, written operating discipline, training and operator qualification, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, compliance audits, incident investigation and an emergency response program.\n\nTexas City is a major petrochemical production facility. The products manufactured at Texas City include: Hydrocarbons, Isopropanol, Oxo alcohols and aldehydes, organic acids, acetic esters, vinyl acetate,and vinyl resins. The regulated substances handled include: vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, isopropyl chloroformate, chlorine, propylene, ethylene, propane, methane and 2-methylpropene.\n\nThis update is being submitted to revise covered chemical inventories in the covered processes.   Since the last submittal, the ethanol process has been shutdown.  It is removed from the RMP submit program.  The OXO process is added to the RMP due to its propylene inventory.  The deletion and addition has resulted in some renumbering of the process IDs.  \n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis \nThe worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for Texas City are as follow:\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical\nFailure of a plant vinyl acetate storage tank releasing 250,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation includes design and construction codes and standards for equipment are met or exceeded as well as the ongoing  mechanical integrity program.  The process is monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  Foam is used by the Emergency Response Team to minimize vapor releases.  \n\nA"

Mitigation includes gas detectors, an emergency shutdown system and a ventilation and scrubber system for the building containing the in use chlorine cylinder.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water in the direction of the vapor cloud to disperse the released chlorine.\n2)\tA leak develops in transfer line due to weld crack or gasket failure releasing 6,000 pounds of vinyl acetate.  Mitigation measures include piping that is welded to minimize the number of flanges and the piping is included in the mechanical integrity program.  Foam is used by the Emergency Response Team to minimize volatilizing leaked vinyl acetate.\n3)\tA pump seal leak releasing a 2,115 lb release of Isopropyl chloroformate into a diked area, which minimizes the area affected.  Sodium carbonate is used for emergency response.  This is combined with foam application by the Emergency Responder Team, to minimize volatilizing released Isopropyl chloroformate.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Flammable Chemical\nFailure of the Propylene storage tank releasing 700,000 pounds of propylene.  The scenario is mitigated by the fact that the tanks are located in above ground earthen bunkers.  The storage tanks are in Texas City\u00bfs mechanical integrity program.  The storage tanks are monitored by computers and trained, qualified operators.  ??Computer controlled ??emergency block valves isolate the system in the event of tank failure.  Emergency Response would apply copious amounts of water to limit the impact on other chemical storage in the surrounding area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Flammable Chemical\nFailure of a nipple on the propane line resulting in a release of 47,100 lbs of propane.   This is mitigated by Texas City\u00bfs mechanical integrity program and the fact that this is in a low traffic area.  Operators rounds verify that the line and its a"
