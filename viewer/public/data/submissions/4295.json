The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Groton Plant has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in The Groton Plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Groton Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Groton Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform The Groton Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements,"

The Groton Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Groton Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Groton Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Groton Plant.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Groton Plant is committed to the safety of Pfizer employees, its contractors, and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Groton Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Groton Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers and contractors as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the local fire department to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  The Groton Plant, in conjunction with the City of Groton local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the local police and fire departments have also established a system to use for"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Groton Plant PSM program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the PSM program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Groton Plant and addresses each PSM program element.  In addition, the Groton Plant has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Groton Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

The offsite consequence analyses consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Groton Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Groton Plant.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to The Groton Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Groton Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team, which includes corporate EHS personnel, develops findings that are forwarded to The Groton Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n  \n1.5\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe bromine storage and ammonia refrigeration processes at the Groton Plant have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation.

      "SummaryText": ".  New employees receive basic training in The Groton Plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Groton Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Groton Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform The Groton Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Groton Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  The Groton Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Groton Plant conducts a pre-startup safet"
