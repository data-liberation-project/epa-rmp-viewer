The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas, LLC facility located in Canton, Michigan complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, each employee is trained monthly on safety policies and procedures.  Hazards identified during quarterly \"safety walks\" are corrected as soon as possible.  \n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures acetylene and stores propane in an above ground storage tank (ASTs).  Both gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane storage/handling process consists of one 18,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment. The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The low pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and stored in a \"gas holder\".  The acetylene that is generated in the low pressure generator is piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe Linde Gas facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The propane and acetylene systems are designed, installed, and m"

      "SummaryText": "aintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the Linde Gas facility in Canton, Michigan.  Each propane/acetylene filler is trained by a certified trainer in all operation fill procedures.  All employees are trained annually on the possible dangers and preventitive safety measures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.  Each year a PSM Audit is performed at the facility.  The group responsible for conducting the audit is composed of both management and employeees.  \n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\nThe Linde Gas facility has not had any reportable accidents involving its propane or acetylene processes over the course of the last five years.  \n\n5.  The emergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our propane or acetylene processes, it is Linde Gas' policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Canton Fire Department.  All members of the Linde Gas emergency response team carry a Technician level certification and yearly training is required by OSHA 1910.120.  All employees have access to Linde Gas' emergency action plan.  Emergency response training is conducted annually.  Both the Canton Fire Department and the Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Commission receive copies of our SARA 312 and SARA 313 reports.  In addition, a fire alarm system has been installed to detect fires in the acetylene plant.  Fire drills are conducted at least once per year.  \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\nA yearly \"Fire Day\" is planned for both employees and local customers which will enhance our relationship with the community.  The first of these \"Fire Days\" is scheduled for August 2004 with both the Canton Fire Department and the Wayne County Emergency Planning Commission."
