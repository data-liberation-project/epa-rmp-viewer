A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates approximately 1-3 in Hg vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Patterson Frozen Foods, Inc. facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nPatterson Frozen Foods, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThere are eight different processes that occur at Patterson Frozen Foods, Inc.  The regulated substances of concern at Patterson Frozen Foods, Inc. are ammonia used in four interconnected refrigeration systems, and chlorine used at three treatment systems and one storage area.  The processes that use or generate regulated substances include the following:  Warehouse System, Warehouse #7 System, Main (engine room) System, East Complex System, Main Building Water Line Chlorine System, Main Building Chlorine Belt Spray System, East Complex Chlorine Dioxide System, and Chlorine Storage Area.\n\nAmmonia is use in one process as a refrigerant.  The maximum intended inventory at Patterson Frozen Food, Inc. is 93,156 pounds. \n\nChlorine is used at four separate processes to treat process water throughout the facility:\n\n- Main Building Water Line Chlorine System           2,000 lbs.

(2 one ton containers and four 150 pound cylinders)\n\nThe process are not co-located or interconnected, therefore, only the chlorine storage process is applicable to the regulation.  The facility has implemented prevention programs that apply the same throughout.\n\nWarehouse System\n\nThe Warehouse System provides refrigeration for cold storage rooms and various process equipment.  High pressure warm liquid ammonia is fed through an intercooler serpentine coil to sub-cool the high pressure liquid ammonia.  Sub-cooled liquid ammonia is then fed to various vessels and/or evaporators: Warehouse #5 liquid coolers, Warehouse #6 liquid coolers, Warehouse #6 accumulators, Warehouse #4 accumulator, cold storage rooms evaporators, 36: room evaporators, 36: room chiller, bean cooler, repack cold room evaporators & repack plate freezers.\n\nThe low pressure receiver or slop tank at Warehouse #4 is a vessel that acts as a protection for the booster compressors in the engine room.  It traps excess liquid coming back from the evaporators through the suction line preventing any liquid from entering the booster compressors.  When the ammonia level in the slop tank reaches the high limit float switch, the IT pump comes on and pumps liquid ammonia into the dump system or liquid transfer vessel that is located directly above the high pressure receiver.  When the vessel is approximately 3/4 full the IT pump stops the three way valve to close the low side port & opens the hot gas port pressurizing the vessel until pressure equalizes with the pressure in the high pressure receiver then liquid ammonia drops (by gravity) into the high pressure receiver.  In the refrigeration system the expansion device reduces the high pressure refrigerant to the accumulators and"

The liquid cooler at Warehouse #6 provides the same function as the cooler at Warehouse #5 but also feeds liquid to two (2) accumulators which supply pumped liquid to four (4) evaporator fan units.  The low pressure vapor from all low side loads is then drawn back to the low pressure receiver. or slop tank by the booster compressors in the engine room.  This vapor is compressed to a higher pressure and discharged by the boosters to the intercooler.  Refrigerant vapor in the intercooler is drawn by the high stage screen compressors and compresses to a higher pressure and temperature so that the heat of vaporization and compression can be rejected and the vapor or gas can be condensed back into liquid by the condenser.\n\nAs an option the warehouse engine room can also provide refrigeration to Warehouses #2 and #3 in the main building.\n\nWarehouse #7 System\n\nThe Warehouse #7 system uses ammonia to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  High pressure liquid ammonia is transferred through an intercooler to lower the temperature of the high pressure liquid.  High pressure liquid is also transferred from the receiver to evaporators 9 through 16.  Subcooled liquid is transferred from the intercooler to the low pressure receiver, or accumulator, where the pressure (temperature) of the liquid is reduced.  The resulting low pressure liquid is pumped to evaporators 1 through 8.  The vapor return from these evaporators is cycled back to the accumulator.  Booster compressors remove the refrigerant vapor from the accumulator and compress it to high pressure vapor.

Unlike evaporators 1 through 8 which receive low pressure liquid from the accumulator, evaporators 9 through 16 receive high pressure liquid from the receiver, which enables products to be cooled at warmer temperatures.\n\nMain Engine Room System\n\nThe Main (engine room) system uses ammonia in various process equipment and in Warehouses 1, 2, and 3.  High pressure liquid ammonia is transferred through intercooler #2 to lower the temperature of the high pressure liquid.  High pressure liquid is also transferred from the receiver to the low pressure receiver (slop tanks), and Model 32/Auto plate freezer accumulator.  Subcooled liquid is transferred from the intercooler to Warehouses 2 and 3, Model 33 plate freezer accumulator, belt freezer accumulators, and chillers #1 through #4.

The local Fire Department responded and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  No injuries were reported.\n\n2) In January 1996, a pressure relief valve failed and released approximately 166 pounds of vapor ammonia to off-site.  Some fumes drifted down wind and was noticed about one block away.  The local Fire Department responded, the facility was evacuated, and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  No injuries were reported.\n\n3) In February 1996, over 100 pounds of saturated vapor ammonia were release in the main plant engine room.  Nuts on a hydraulic pump were stripped down, creating a crack in the bottom of the pump.  The local Fire Department was called to notify the nearby school.  The facility was evacuated and the leak was stopped by isolating the line.  One employee was sent to Del Puerto Hospital with an acute anxiety attack.  She was treated and released back to work.\n\n4) In June 1996, approximately 100 pounds of chlorine vapor/liquid mixture was released from a 150 pound cylinder.  The fire department responded and isolated the immediate area.  The responders stopped the leak by applying temporary patch and isolating that portion of the system.  No injuries were reported.\n\n5) In April 1999, a Patterson operator was raising a stack of plates in a package freezer and a hydraulic ram failed.  The stack fell and broke an ammonia liquid line connection.  Approximately 100 pounds of ammonia was released.  The facility personnel was evacuated and the leak was stopped by"
