If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Waseca Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY: FCI Waseca is located at 1000 University Drive S.W., Waseca, Minnesota. The mailing address is P.O. Box 1731, Waseca, MN 56093. Since the institution's activation in June, 1996, this facility has operated as a low level Federal Correctional Institution. The institution has a 30,000 gallon above ground propane tank located at the Rear gate area on the west side of the institution's property. Propane is delivered by bulk truck and tank stored. This 30,000 gallon propane tank provides back-up fuel supply to the institution's heating system. WORST CASE SCENARIO: Our worst case scenario is failure of 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 2 miles. There is residential housing within the distance to the endpoint, with an estimated population of 9,000 people. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicaple state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed  and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. FOUR YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Waseca Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy"
