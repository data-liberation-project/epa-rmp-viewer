Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\nThe management and employees of LaSalle County Farm Supply Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 140,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The accidential release prevention program.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidential Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.  Five year accident history.\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n          -    have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n          -    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property\n               damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program.\nThe facility has:\n\n          -    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n          -    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know \n               information as r"
