      "SummaryText": "The Cana Gas Plant is a natural gas liquids (NGL), amine treating and gas dehydration facility (\"Facility\"), which utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas.  The NGL is an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Cana Gas Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant.  Therefore, the Cana Gas Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule.  All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Cana Gas Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Cana Gas Plant employs 10 full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Devon Energy Corporation, last submitted a full RMP the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in July 2013 for the Cana Gas Plant.    \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Cana Gas Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL treatment operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with t"

NGL is a flammable hydrocarbon mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated flammables: propane, ethane, N-butane, isobutane, isopentane, N-pentane, and methane.  The amine used at the Cana Gas Plant is not RMP-regulated due to its lack of RMP-regulated components.\n\n\n\nThe Facility also stores and processes the following RMP-regulated substances: methane and pentane.  Methane and pentane are stored at the Facility in their pure form.   \n\n\n\nThe provides the maximum storage capacity and largest vessel capacity for all of the RMP-regulated flammables stored at the Cana Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nRMP STORAGE INVENTORY\n\n\n\nSubstance\n\nMethane: Maximum inventory 88,786 pounds; Largest vessel 11,968 pounds\n\nNatural Gas Liquids: Maximum inventory 1,937,769 pounds; Largest vessel 276,301 pounds \n\nPentane: Maximum inventory 1,020,950 pounds; Largest vessel 165,541 pounds \n\n\n\nThe substances stored at the Cana Gas Plant were also evaluated for toxic characteristics; it was determined that there are no RMP-regulated toxic substances handled at the Facility in quantities that exceed RMP threshold quantities. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Cana Gas Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of natural gas condensate.  As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM.

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\nPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\nProper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\nEmergency response measures; \n\nProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \n\nEmployee training; and \n\nProgram review procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Cana Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility.  The ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instru"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained.  Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the ERP with the Canadian County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Calumet County Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  EnLink operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, EnLink conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nEnLink has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis for the Facility was completed on June 29, 2011.   "
