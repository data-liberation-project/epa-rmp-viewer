All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are\naddressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and\nresponse agency interaction.\n\nThe Rocky Creek WPCP utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before it is\nreturned to the Ocmulgee River.  In addition, the Rocky Creek WPCP also uses Anhydrous\nAmmonia to assist in treating wastewater.  Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine\ncylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, and process\nsafety equipment.  Ammonia processes include liquid Anhydrous Ammonia above ground\ntanks, an instrumentation room, electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance\ntraveled by chlorine and ammonia released before its concentration decrease to a\ntheoretical \"toxic endpoint.\"  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene\nAssociation as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly\nall individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-\nthreatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to\nthe toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Rocky Creek WPCP involves a failure of a 13,000\ngallon storage vessel yielding a cumulative release of 10,000 gallons (52,000 lbs) of\nammonia.  The Rocky Creek facility has two (2) storage vessels for ammonia.  The\nmaximum inventory for ammonia at any given time is 52,000 lbs.  When atmospheric\ndispersion modeling for the wor"

When atmospheric dispersion modeling for this scenario was performed using\nthe RMP* Comp. Version 1.06 a distance to a toxic endpoint of .3 urban miles was\nobtained. \n\nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder yielding\na cumulative release of 2,000 lbs.  When atmospheric dispersion modeling for this unlikely\nscenario was performed using the RMP* Comp. Version 1.06 a distance to a toxic endpoint\nof .9 urban miles was obtained.  \n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for all chlorination processes involves tubing\nfailure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of 317 lbs of chlorine. \nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for this scenario was performed using the RMP*\nComp Version 1.06 a distance to a toxic endpoint of .1 urban miles was obtained.\n\nThe Rocky Creek WPCP Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to\nmitigate the effects of potential ammonia and chlorine release hazards:\n\n     Operator Training\n     Preventive Maintenance Program\n     Process Specific Safety Equipment\n     Safe and Effective Standard Operating Procedures\n     Hazard Review of Equipment and procedures\n     Auditing and Inspection Programs\n     Comprehensive Management Program\n\nThe Rocky Creek WPCP has an active environmental, health and safety program with the\nfollowing elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the anhydrous\nammonia processes.\n\n     Respirator Protection (SCBA) Program\n     Chlorine Detectors and Ammonia Shut Off Valves\n     Chemical Right-To-Know Program\n     Personal Protective Equipment Program\n\nThe Rocky Creek facility has a written Emerge"

These preventive measures will provide for the continuous\nimprovement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe\nhandling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine or anhydrous ammonia\nincidents."
