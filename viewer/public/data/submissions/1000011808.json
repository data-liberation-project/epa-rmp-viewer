This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release were to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2  \tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 22,340 pounds.\n\n3  \tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to Emergency\nPlanning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\tProcess Safety Information\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified\nand controlled safely. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist. The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and"
