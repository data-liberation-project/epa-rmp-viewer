Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of data from the 2010 US Census Bureau in MARPLOT mapping system software.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nMartin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Martin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nAccident History\n\nThis is the initial RMP for the Martin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, facility.  There have been no previous accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in on site or off-site impacts, or that required reporting.  \n \n\nEmergency Action/Response Plan\n\nMartin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, current Emergency Response Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  Martin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and New Franklin County Fire Department and HazMat team on emergency preparedness.  The written plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nMartin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration processes at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMartins Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the New Franklin Fire Company and the Franklin County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system\u0092s purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Martin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Martin\u0092s Famous Pastry \u0096 Chambersburg, PA, is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Martin\u0092s Famo"
