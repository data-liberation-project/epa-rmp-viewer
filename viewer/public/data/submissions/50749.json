A copy of this plan is concurrently submitted to the Caldwell County LEPC under County Emergency Services and Emergency Management.\n \nPlanned changes to improve safety:  The 18,000-gallon tank will be replaced with a 12,000-gallon fixed feed tank and elimination of the 1,990-gallon fixed feed tank.  This permanent installation will be fitted with an appropriately sized deluge fire protection system."

Our employees are also trained in fire extinguisher use to handle small incipient incidents.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a paint production plant storing flammable solvents and propane/isobutane for aerosol filling from a 18,000-gallon portable bulk tank supplying an intermediate 1,990-gallon fixed feed tank.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 18,000-gallon propellant storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 50 deg. F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is vapor cloud fire.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane/isobutene system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving propane/isobutane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane/isobutane system, it is our policy to notify the Hudson Fire Department and request that they help respond to the"
