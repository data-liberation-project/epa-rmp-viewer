Southern Water Treatment Company, Inc. accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.\n\nb. Southern Water Treatment is a company devoted to removing metals from wastewater. We also recycle F006 sludge from customer facilities. SWT serves companies all over the United states. SWT facility is located on White Horse Road in Greenville, South Carolina. The facility includes a DTC manufacturing area, blending area, chemical recovery area, a warehouse, a bulk storage area, and office/administrative area.  The hazardous chemicals SWT handles in this facility are Carbon Disulfide (CS2) and Dimethylamine (DMA). The facility is manned from 6:00 am to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. All other times, designated personnel are on call and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.\n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The worst case scenario is as defined by EPA.  Both scenarios involve Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine. \n\nd. The model Southern water Treatment used was the EPA's RMP Comp model. The model used atmospheric dispersion modeling to determine the distance traveled by the Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic worst case scenario involves liquid spill and vaporization of carbon disulfide released at 79.4 lbs./minute for the maximum quantity possible.  The worst case flammable scenarion involves Dimethylamine liquefied under pressure released at the maximum quantity from the vessel.   Mitigation measures considered is a CS2 dike of 756 square feet with water seal, which will reduce the amount of Carbon Disulfide released.  The alternative scenario involves Carbon disulfide ves"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has been defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\n\ne. The general Southern Water Treatment Risk management program is based on the following key elements:\n7 Training of the operators\n7 Preventive Maintenance\n7 Safety Equipment\n7 Safety training\n7 Operating procedural training\n7 Job Hazard Analysis\n7 Audit and Inspection program\n7 Hazard communication training\n\nf. No accidental release of carbon Disulfide or Dimethylamine has occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\ng. The facility has an Emergency response program, coordinated with the Greenville Fire Department and the local hospital. This program includes Emergency response training and emergency response decision tier."
