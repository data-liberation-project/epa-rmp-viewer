In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller and packager of chemicals to industrial, commercial, and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory of 200 types of chemicals, 2 of these are subject to RMP regulations. The facility is located on 8.393 acres within the Edgely Industrial Park bordered by a rail siding to the north, a marsh on the east, a marsh and then State Road to the south, and Gilbreth International on the west.\n\nProducts Covered by RMP are\n\nChlorine  CAS # 7782-50-5\nSulfur Dioxide  CAS # 7446-09-5\n\nBoth of these items are delivered to Coyne in 100 # and 150 # Cylinders, the are stored inside the warehouse in racks with 16 cylinders per rack. We have had a no off site releases of these items in the past 5 years.  The worst case scenario for Chlorine is a release of the entire contents of one 150# cylinder in 10 minutes from a broken valve. This scenario has an end point of 3 tenths of a mile. Do to the fact that these items are stored and transported in racks the worst case scenario is not likely to occur.  The alternative scenario for both items is a small leak from a valve or packing nut releasing 150 # over the period of one hour with an endpoint of 1 tenth of a mile. Mitigation for ether of these events includes applying a cylinder \"A\" kit or placing the leaking cylinder into a containment vessel. \n\nCoyne Chemical has an in-house Emergency Response Team trained to handle this type of emergency. \nIn addition when the facility is closed a Manager is on call and can be reached through our emergency voice mail system.\n\nCoyne Chemical is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and subscribes to its Responsible Distribution Process. As part of this process Coyne Chemical has developed polices regarding Risk Management and Emergency Response.\n\n RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\nIt is the policy "
