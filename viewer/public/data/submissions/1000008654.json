The Tullahoma Wastewater Treatment Plant (TWWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.\nAll applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The TWWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\nB. TullahomaA?s wastewater treatment system has been installed to disinfect the flow out of the Tullahoma wastewater treatment plant located at 1012 South Franklin. The wastewater comes into wastewater plant, is treated, and flows out into Rock Creek. The treatment process includes the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are housed together in an enclosed building. The building contains six (6) ton cylinders of chlorine, and four (4) ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide. The storage area of the building contains four (4) additional ton cylinders of chlorine and four (4) ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide. Various types of safety equipment, monitoring devices, and control devices are housed within the building, as well as access to safety equipment inside and outside the building. The facility is monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week by on site personnel.\nC. The general TWWTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n-High level of training of the operators\n-Preventative maintenance programs\n-Use of state-of-the- art process and safety equipment\n-Use of accurate and effective operation procedures, written with the participation of the "

No accidental release of chlorine and no sulfur dioxide release has occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\nE. The facility has an emergency response program coordinated with Coffee County Emergency Management, Fire Department, and Police Department depending upon the size of the leak, weather conditions, wind speeds and direction. If advanced level of technical assistance is deemed necessary to control leak, Chemtrec may be called to give advice and assistance via 24-hour emergency number. Brenntag Chemical has a first response team that can be activated with a one-hour notice 24 hours a day. \nF. We have in place a chlorine and sulfur dioxide emergency action and process safety management plan dated March 1, 2008. No revisions have been found necessary at this time."
