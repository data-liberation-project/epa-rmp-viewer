      "SummaryText": "Shawnee Milling Company operates rural feed stores offering anhydrous ammonia to local farmers.  The Arnett Grain and Feed Store is located on the outskirts of the rural town of Arnett.   The maximum quantity of this toxic unrefrigerated liquid at any one time is 50,000 pounds.  For approximately 3-4 months of the year, the average on-hand quantity is less than 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe company ensures that the tank and its components are regularly maintained by qualified contractors.  The facility is regularly inspected by both employees, it's insurance carrier, and the State of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility would have a maximum of 50,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia onsite at its peak sales periods.  Administrative operating procedures limt tank storage to 85% of maximum capacity.\n\nThe worst case scenario is structural damage to the bulk storage tank containing, at peark operating periods, up to 50,000 pounds of NH3.  Failure would result in a near-full release of ammonia within 10 minutes in a rural environment.  The toxic endpoint has been calculated to be 4 miles from the tank at which point it would be dispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Public receptors incude residences and schools.  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\nThe more probable alternative accidental release would involve a transfer hose failure that could potentially result in up to 100 pounds release of anhydrous ammonia before an emergency shutoff valve could be activated.  The toxic endpoint would be limited to 0.2 miles which would expose a very few people driving along the main cross highways of Highway 283 and Highway 60.  There are no residences or schools within the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles from the store.\n\nThis facility follows the emergency response plan established by the Ellis LEPC and coordinated with the Arnett Volunteer Fire Department.  Employees are not permitted to respond to any larg"
