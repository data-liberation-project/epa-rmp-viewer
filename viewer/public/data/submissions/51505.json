              "Description": "The Light Olefins Unit (LOU) Process has five units which are the Hot Side, Cold Side, GHU/PHU, PDU and LOU Offsites.  The Hot Side includes the furnaces up through the quench columns.  The Cold Side includes compression, refrigeration, and fractionation.  GHU/PHU are two stage gasoline and pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation units.   The PDU is the propylene drying and transfer units.  LOU Offsites include tankage, waste water stripping unit, flare, custody transfer stations, and loading racks associated with the LOU.  The process controls, mitigations, monitors and detectors listed apply to all units except as follows:  the PDU and LOU Offsites do not have automatic shutoffs; the GHU/PHU and Cold Side are the only units with quench system process controls; only LOU Offsite unit tankage have dikes; the GHU and part of the PHU do not have process area detectors; and fire detectors are only at the PDU, LOU, Compressor Decks, and LOU Lube Oil Skids.  The flammable mixture mass noted below includes inventories of non RMP flammable chemicals and RMP flammable chemicals below the threshold quantity in the process.  RMP chemicals below the threshold quantity included in the flammable mixture are: Acetylene, Ethyl Acetylene, cylohexlamine, Vinylacetate, Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbon Disulfide, and Hydrogen.",

Flint Hills Resources Port Arthur Chemicals (PAC) is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety and anticipates to participate in VPP as a conditional Star Site.  Flint Hills Resources PAC maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals, however FHR has identified the need for improvement in the PSM program and is working to address those improvement areas.  Flint Hills Resources PAC participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Port Arthur Fire Department and the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Additionally, Flint Hills Resources PAC participates in the Southeast Texas Alerting Network, STAN, a public awareness system designed to communicate important information to the people of Southeast Texas.  During community emergencies, local emergency management and industrial officials can post information on the STAN line - (877-THE-STAN.)  The Site Manager of PAC is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP).\n\n2.  Regulated Substances.   The PAC Plant employs 178 people and is located on 244.26 acres plus 29.94 acres of shared property with an adjacent industrial complex at the corner of State Highway 73 and Savanna Avenue in Port Arthur, Texas.  The site first opened in 1957 and was acquired in an asset purchase agreement by Flint Hills Resources November, 05, 2008.  The site produces as primary end products ethylene, propylene, cyclohexane and intermediates.  PAC has four processes:  the Light Olefins Unit (LOU) manufac"

This includes information pertaining to: \nHazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure, and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design specifications.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nPHAs are available in the facility files for each process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  PAC utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  PAC assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards.  Approved recommendations are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Flint Hills does have a Hurricane Procedure for PAC and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane or inclement weather.\n \nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures that were developed in consultation with "
