Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Arvin Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass cold storage of fruit.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used for our refrigeration system.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 31000.00 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia refrigeration system. In this scenario 31000 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.37 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia the refrigeration system.

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 195 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.02 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Arvin Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 4/20/2000.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Arvin Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and star"

Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nJohn Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Arvin Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Arvin Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 4/20/2000.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at John Van Curen Receiver, Merjan Farmlands LLC - Arvin Plant.  The most recent review was performed on 4/20/2000.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are"
