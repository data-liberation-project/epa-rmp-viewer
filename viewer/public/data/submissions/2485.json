The\nplant treats all wastewater generated by the City of Pocatello and the City of Chubbuck. Treatment \nconsists of primary and secondary treatment with disinfection using a final\nchlorination/dechlorination process prior to being discharged to the Portneuf River.  Because the\nCity of Pocatello exceeds the threshold quantity for the chemicals Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide it\nmust comply with the mandated EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP). \n\nThe two major elements in the RMP for Pocatello are the Off Site Consequence Analysis' for\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide and a Prevention Program. The City of Pocatello's Waste Water\nTreatment Plant is also required to do Offsite Consequence Analysis for  a worst case release\nscenario and alternative release scenario. Pocatello's Prevention Plan includes information about\nsafety, process hazards, operating procedures, training programs, maintenance programs, compliance\naudits, and accident investigation. \n\nThe RMP offsite consequence analysis for both the worst case release scenario and alternative\nrelease scenario were performed for accidental release of the toxic gases chlorine and sulfur dioxide \nusing the EPA software program, RMP*Comp.\n\nFor Chlorine:\nThe worst-case scenario analysis requires considering the release chlorine from the largest single\nvessel.  The largest single vessel of chlorine is a one ton cylinder. The analysis considers  a release\nrate of 200 pounds per minute, with a release time of 10 minutes. The topography is urban\nsurroundings. However, the building is not used as a mitigation measure because the chlorine is\ndelivered outside. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario analysis considers the release chlorine a 1/4 inch hole from a pigtail\nconnection breaking.  This analysis uses a release rate of 9 pounds per minute, with a release time\nof 222 minutes (Risk Man"

The analysis considers a release rate of 4 pounds per minute, with a\nrelease time of 500 minutes (Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants,\nChapter 4, Exhibit 4-19).

The\nobjective of this plan is to continue this history and prevent any accidental releases,  and to respond\neffectively and timely in the unlikely event there is a release.  Pocatello's RMP includes an incident\nreport form will be used in the unlikely event there is an accidental release.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe roles and responsibilities of the staff that oversees the risk management program elements will\nhelp to ensure effective "

Safety information was used to perform\na process hazard analysis and the results of the analysis were used to revise and update operating and\nmaintenance procedures. Training programs to ensure employees to understand and manage risks\nhave been revised and continued training is provided.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide have been used for many years in the chlorination and dechlorination\nprocess at Pocatello's Wastewater Treatment Plant.  As references for chlorine and sulfur dioxide\nhandling Pocatello uses The Chlorine Manual (The Chlorine Institute, 1986, 5th edition), Chlorine\nAnd Its Properties, (Capital Controls Company, Inc., 1990, Pub.

These SOPs are updated when ever there are any\nchanges made to any part of the chlorine system.\n\nNew employees are give general training in the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of their\nplant employee orientation.

The maintenance employees also receive OJT on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems\nbefore they are allowed to independently work on the chlorine or sulfur dioxide systems.\n\nYearly refresher training is given on the nature and hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \nDocumentation of this training is kept in the plant safety training records.\n     \nMAINTENANCE\n\nWritten procedures for inspection and testing are incorporated into a preventive maintenance (PM)\nprogram and have been in effect since construction completion in 1992. The PM is conducted in\naccordance with the manufactures recommended procedures and sound engineering practices.  The\nPM program is operated by a computer system that generates the needed information when a piece\nof equipment is in need of inspection or service.  \n\nTechnical manuals for the chlorination/dechlorination processes consist of three volumes which are\ncurrent and located in the maintenance library.\n\nInitial training on the chlorination/dechlorination systems were conducted by construction contractor\nand equipment manufactures at completion of construction.

This is what we may refer to as a \"near miss,\" meaning that serious consequences\ndid not occur, but could have.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant  is required under EPA regulations to conduct a self-audit and\ndocument compliance on a signed document every three years.  The certification will verify that the\nprocedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  A report of the findings of the audit\nwill be developed.\n\nThe Wastewater Superintendent or designee will determine and document a response to each\ndeficiency identified in the compliance audit.

The procedure requires a minimum\nof two individuals to be present when an emergency is apparent or suspected.  A minimum of \"Level\nB\" respiratory protective equipment will be required.
