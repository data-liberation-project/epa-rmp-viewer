To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Mexican Original, Sanford NC, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.  To insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Mexican Original, Sanford NC, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.

Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  15,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 15,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.4 Miles before no longer posing a health hazard    to the public.

Alternative release scenario i. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had -0- releases in the past 5 years of this type.\n\nAlternative release scenario ii.  A pull-away causing a failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch hose.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose is released.  The resulting unconfined  vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is less than 320 feet. \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.
