EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nParallel Energy LP (Parallel Energy) owns and operates the Burnett Main Compressor Station (Burnett Main CS) located in Borger, Texas.  Natural gas and associated liquids enter the Burnett Main CS through pipelines with various diameters.  The Burnett Main CS includes facilities for the following; gas, water and condensate separation; gas compression, and vapor recovery.  The inlet gas and liquid handling system separates inlet fluids into gas, free water and condensate and routes each fluid as follows:\r\n\r\n \tGas flows to the Gas Compression System;\r\n \tWater flows to the Separated Water Storage and Injection System;\r\n \tCondensate flows either to the Condensate Stabilization System or, temporarily, to Product Storage Tanks.\r\n\r\nThere are three (3) equalized condensate storage tank batteries in operation at Burnett Main CS.  Each condensate storage tank is limited by administrative controls to 500 barrels.  For the purpose of this assessment, the maximum volume of condensate on site at any one time would be 1,500 barrels (63,000 gallons), which is equivalent to 352,170 lbs condensate.  \r\n\r\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004.  The regulated chemicals at Burnett Main CS consist of specific flammable hydrocarbons present within the natural gas liquid (NGL, or \"condensate) and gas streams within the plants.  The regulated hydrocarbons include:\r\n\r\n \tMethane;\r\n \tEthane;\r\n \tPropane;\r\n \tButane; and\r\n \tPentane.\r\n\r\nThese regulated compounds are present within flammable liquid and vapor streams that constitute various \"fla"

According to this section of the regulation, if any one of the regulated flammable compounds is present above one weight percent in the mixture, the entire weight of the mixture must be considered when establishing the total process quantity for RMP-applicability purposes.  Burnett Main CS contains 352,170 lbs. of condensate which exceeds the 10,000 lb applicability threshold for flammable mixtures.  Since the RMP applicability is triggered, the Station is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare an RMP.\r\n\r\n1.2. RMP REQUIERMENTS\r\n\r\nAll facilities subject to the RMP rule must complete a hazard assessment analysis for the regulated chemical. In addition, the recent (5-year) accident history and emergency response plan must be reviewed. Based on these assessments, the Station will be classified within one of three program levels.\r\n\r\n>\tProgram 1 - no offsite receptor impacted (potentially and in last five years)\r\n>\tProgram 2 - offsite impacts and not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard (OSHA PSM)\r\n>\tProgram 3 - offsite impacts and subject to OSHA PSM    \r\n\r\nAll programs require submittal of an RMPlan. For Program 2 and 3 processes, two additional tasks are required: a release prevention program and an emergency response program. The following sections provide a brief summary of the hazard assessment, accident history, prevention program, emergency response, and subsequent RMP program level determination for the Burnett Main CS.\r\n\r\n1.3. HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nThree potential release scenario of condensate were identified as having the largest potential impact, should a release occur: the inlet slug catcher tank rupture, the truck loading leaking, and the process piping rupture. The rupture of the inlet slug catcher tank was identified to be the worst-case release scenario since it will result the largest release quantity. F"

RECEPTORS IMPACTED\r\n\r\nOnce the impact distance of the worst-case release scenario is examined, the impact on off-site receptors must be considered. If public receptors   or environmental receptors   are impacted, additional analysis is required. The level of concern (0.6 miles) extends past the fence line to off-site locations, and any unrestricted areas within this region must be evaluated to determine if public or environmental receptors are impacted. There are no environmental receptors within the impact radius. Details on the receptors impacted are provided in Section 2.3.\r\n\r\n1.5. PROGRAM LEVEL\r\n\r\nCondensate storage at the Burnett Main CS qualifies as a Program 2 process since, based on the offsite consequence analysis, the maximum distance to the level of concern impacts public receptors and the process is not subject to the OSHA process safety management standard (29 CFR \u00a71910.19).  \r\n \r\n2. HAZARD ASSESSMENT \r\n\r\n2.1. POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA \"worst-case release\" is defined under 40 CFR \u00a768.3 as:\r\n\r\n\"... the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(a).\"\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario quantity is determined in 40 CFR \u00a768.25(b) as the greatest amount in any single vessel or pipe used in a covered process, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.\r\n\r\nThe term \"process\" is defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.3 as:\r\n\r\n\"... any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities. For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance c"

      "SummaryText": "ould be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\"\r\n\r\nThe definition of \"process\" is broad and can be interpreted to include all equipment handling a regulated substance.  Three main processes at the Burnett Main CS have the potential to release a regulated substance. These include:\r\n1. Tank rupture;\r\n2. Leaking during truck loading operations; \r\n3. Process piping rupture. \r\n\r\n2.1.1. Tank Rupture\r\nThe largest volume of condensate stored at three (3) equalized condensate storage tank batteries at any one time would be 63,000 gallons.  Should a spill occur, all of 63,000 gallons of natural gas condensate is assumed to be released in the worst-case release scenario.  Assuming the vessel is filled to 63,000 gallons with natural gas liquids with a specific gravity of 0.67, the maximum release quantity would be 352,170 lbs. \r\n\r\n2.1.2. Truck Loading Leaking\r\nThe leaking of condensate from truck loading hoses and connectors is another major potential release scenario with a release resulting from a transfer hose breakage at a truck loading rate of 4.5 barrel/min.  Based on information provided by operations personnel, response time has been estimated at 1 minute.  This is based on the time would take the loading operator to shut down the loading operation upon discovery of the release.  The total release of condensate is calculated as 1,057 lbs with detailed calculations shown in section 2.4.2.  \r\n&#8195;\r\n2.1.3. Process Piping Rupture\r\nFor purposes of the alternative analysis, the rupture of process piping which would lead to a release is assumed to consist of a 50 lb/min release of natural gas liquids (methane) for 30 minutes. The total release of natural gas liquids in this case is 1,500 lbs.  The release from the piping system is discussed in detail in the alternative scenarios.\r\n\r\nSince the corresponding volume of release from the inlet slug catcher tank is larger than the piping rupture, and truck loading/unloading leaking, the rupture of"

WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFor the worst-case scenarios, RMP*Comp simply requires the input of the compounds involved in the release, and their quantities.  The largest condensate storage tank rupture is assumed to be the worst-case release scenario.  It is noted that this vessel does not operate with full liquid levels under normal, or even foreseeable conditions.  The RMP regulation allows a reduction in the worst-case release quantities below maximum vessel capacities if documented administrative controls are in place to limit vessel inventories.  However, for purposes of conservatism, the Burnett Main CS has assumed that the vessel would be filled to a maximum of 63,000 gallons at the time of a worst-case accidental release situation. Assuming the vessel is filled to 63,000 gallons with natural gas liquids with a specific gravity of 0.67, the maximum release quantity would be 352,170 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe composition of regulated chemicals as input to RMP*Comp for the worst-case scenarios is based on analytical records, and is given below in Table 2-1.\r\nTable 2-1 Worst-Case Scenario Release Composition\r\n\r\nRMP-Regulated Compound\t\r\nWeight Percent, %\t\r\nWorst-Case Quantity, lbs.\r\nMethane\t0.01\t35.24\r\nEthane\t0.08\t281.75\r\nPropane\t1.60\t5,634.71\r\nButane\t9.46\t33,315.26\r\nPentane\t88.85\t312,903.04\r\nTotals\t100.00\t352,170\r\n\r\n2.2.1.

      "SummaryText": "spersion Modeling Analysis\r\nThe dispersion modeling analysis for accidental condensate release into the ambient air is evaluated with the RMP*Comp program (Version 2.01).  The software computes the distance to the applicable \"endpoints\", which are the damage thresholds specified within the RMP regulation.  For the worst-case vapor cloud explosion, the endpoint distance is 1.0 psi explosion overpressure.  This level of overpressure is considered to be the lower threshold of significant damage to most wood-frame structures, within which offsite residents could be seriously injured.  Beside the release and meteorological conditions discussed above, the analysis also utilized the rural ground surface roughness.  The modeled Distance-To- Endpoint was 0.6 miles, regardless of whether the accidental release is considered as the mixture of ethane, butane, methane, pentane and propane.  The detailed RMP*Comp output listing for the worst case scenario is included in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n2.3. OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\nAfter the distance to the flammable endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors, and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule.  The population within a circle centered at the point of release and a radius equal to the distance to the flammable endpoint should be estimated to two significant digits. In addition, all types of public receptors (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas or arenas, major commercial or industrial areas) and environmental receptors (national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; federal wilderness areas) within this distance should be identified.\r\n\r\nMARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks, Version 4.2.4) was used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the flammable endpoint and to"

The demographic information in MARPLOT is based on the 2010 Census. \r\n\r\nMARPLOT shows that no population is within the 0.6 mile impact radius for the worst case release.  The impact areas on a MARPLOT map is demonstrated in Figure 1 in Appendix B.  The satellite view of impacted area is illustrated in Figure 2 in Appendix B.  The types of public receptors   and environmental receptors   identified within the impact area are listed in Table 2-3.  As can be seen from Figure 1, within the 0.6 mile distance of the tank batteries there are offsite residences as public receptors.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO RELEASE ANALYSIS \r\n\r\n2.4.1. Release from Process Piping\r\nFor alternative release scenarios, leaking of condensate from process piping rupture was considered to be modeled.  The rate of release was assumed to be 50 lb/min and the duration of release was assumed to be 30 minutes.  The total release of natural gas condensate was calculated as 1,500 lbs. \r\n\r\nFor purposes of the RMP*Comp calculations, natural gas is assumed to consist of 100% methane.

The meteorological parameters for the alternative scenario are defined by 40 CFR \u00a768.28(b) as having a wind speed of 3 m/s and the atmospheric stability Class D with an ambient temperature of 25 \u00b0C.  Beside the release and meteorological conditions, the analysis also utilized the rural ground surface roughness.  The scenario is not expected to occur, but is more likely than that worst-case vapor cloud explosion scenario described above.  The modeled Distance-To-Endpoint was 0.1 mile.  The detailed RMP*Comp output listing for the alternative scenario is included in Appendix A.\r\n\r\nAfter the distance to the toxic endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors, and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule. MARPLOT (Version 4.2.4) is used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the flammable endpoint and to identify public receptors.  As can be seen from the map, the distance to the nearest public receptor is beyond the 0.1 mile distance to the level of concern.  Additionally, no environmental receptors are impacted by the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\n2.4.2. Release from Truck Loading\r\nAnother alternative release scenario, leaking of condensate from failing truck loading hoses and connectors was considered to be modeled.  The rate of release is assumed to be the same as loading rate (4.5 barrel/min) and the duration of release is assumed to be the time needed to deploy shutdown measures, which is 1 minute.  This is based on the time would take the loading operator to shut down the loading operation from the discovery of the release.  The total release of condensate is calculated as 1,057 lbs with detailed calculation shown below.\r\n\r\n(4.5 barrel/min)* (42gallon/barrel)*(8.34 lb/gallon)* (0.6705)*(1 min) = 1,056.9 lbs\r\n\r\nFrom the results of these calculations, the dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative scenario related to an accidental release into the ambien"
