Corporate and Emergency Response Approach\n\nU.S. Agri-Chemicals personnel are committed to being responsible corporate citizens of the communities in which they live and work.  The protection of the environment and the control of environmental matters receive top priority, support, and participation by all employees.\n\n\n2.    Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe U.S. Agri-Chemicals facility located in Bartow, Florida on Highway 60, produces granular diammonium phosphate (DAP).  The DAP production process requires the use of ammonia which is stored in four 225 ton `bullets? administratively controlled to 180 tons each (80%).  The Bartow Chemical Plant produces ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by pipeline and is stored in vessels called bullets.  Ammonia is combined with phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.\n\n3.    Prevention Program\n\nThe accidental release prevention program includes:  \n     -  a requirement to ensure covered process equipment are properly designed with emergency shutoff;\n     -  training of maintenance personnel and testing of critical covered process equipment;\n     -  written operating procedures and training of operators;and\n     -  safety inspections, reviews, and audits of covered process equipment.\n\n4.    Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response\n\nThe emergency response policy is as follows:  \nU. S. Agri-Chemicals is committed to training and equipping its personnel to handle incidental releases of ammonia and expects its personnel to summon appropriate professional services to handle any incident that escalates beyond their capability.\n\nThe emergency response program includes:     \n     -  a written emergency response plan;\n     -  joint emergency response exercises conducted with community responders; and\n     -  appropriate emergency response equipment."
