All  process  hazard  analysis  teams\n\ninclude an experienced unit operator, and employees are also\n\nmembers  of  teams  formed for compliance  audits,  incident\n\ninvestigations,  and pre-startup safety reviews.  The  plant\n\nemergency  response team is comprised of qualified employees\n\nwho   receive   specialized  training  and  participate   in\n\nemergency drills. Employees are expected to report incidents\n\nthat  may  occur,  as well as any safety concerns  they  may\n\nhave.  Employee  assistance is enlisted to develop  training\n\nprograms and operating procedures and compile other critical\n\nprocess  information. Additionally, LAR has  various  safety\n\nprograms  designed to increase plant safety  by  encouraging\n\nemployee involvement.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLAR   maintains   key  technical  documents   that   contain\n\ninformation  essential  to  safe operation  of  the  various\n\nprocesses.
