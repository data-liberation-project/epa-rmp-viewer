EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  OLD TOWN MILL\n\nES.1  FORT JAMES OPERATING COMPANY'S POLICIES ON ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nCORPORATE COMMITMENT\n\nFort James Corporation's (Fort James) basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Fort James Old Town Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nFort James has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Fort James Old Town Mill plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at Old Town have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine and chlorine dioxide.\n\nThe Fort James Old Town Mill has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The management system (shown in Figure 1-1) identifies jo"

It is located on the Penobscot River near Old Town, Maine. \n\nThe facility produces northern hardwood pulp.  Hardwood pulp is produced in two Kamyr kraft continuous digesters. Non-condensable gases are primarily incinerated in the mill's lime kiln. The kiln is equipped with a TRS continuous emission monitor.  The facility uses the #5 power boiler as a back-up incineration location.\n\nHardwood pulp from the two digesters are combined after chlorine is applied in the bleach plant.  The bleaching operations use chlorine, chlorine dioxide, peroxide and oxygen.  Emissions from the bleach plant is collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber.  Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and the emissions from this process is also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES AND PROCESSES\n\nThe Old Town Mill operates two processes that have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance. These two are:\n\n1.)  Chlorine unloading and vaporization:  This process stores liquid chlorine in 90-ton rail \tcars.\n2.)  Chlorin"

The chlorine dioxide is less than a 1% solution and is not directly regulated under RMP, Fort James is voluntarily including the chemical for inclusion in the plan. \n\nSince the resulting planning zone predicted for the worst-case toxic release for each of these processes potentially affects public receptors, the regulated processes are subject to Program 3 requirements. \n\n\nES.3   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS AT THE OLD TOWN MILL\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Old Town Mill of Fort James Corporation has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program.  The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of twelve elements which are listed below.\n\n* Process safety information.\n* Process hazard analysis.\n* Operating procedures.\n* Training.\n* Mechanical integrity.\n* Management of change.\n* Pre-startup review.\n* Compliance audits.\n* Incident investigation.\n* Employee participation.\n* Hot work permit.\n* Contractors.\n\nSome elements of the prevention program are intended to assure that designs are reviewed so that new plant and equipment are in conformance to safe design principles.  The remainder of the elements assure that the operation, maintenance and control of hazards are performed to prevent inadvertent changes outside the safe design and operating envelope.\n\nFort James Corporation concurs with US EPA's assessment that, Prevention of accidental releases requires a holistic approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  Therefore, Old Town Mill's prevention program is des"

Rather it provides a means for assuring safe operations throughout the life of the facility.  To this end, Old Town Mill utilizes modern computer managing techniques in coordination with plant-wide awareness to ensure continued fulfillment of prevention requirements.\n\nES.4   5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY AT THE OLD TOWN MILL\n\nFort James Corporation has an outstanding record of accident prevention over the past five years.  This good record is demonstrated by the lack of any accidental release which had offsite consequences over the past five years and by the decreasing frequency of any kind of accident.\n\n\nES.5   HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the offsite consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors.  Pubic receptors are offsite residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals),  commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release.  Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as a result of an accidental release.\n\nThis section describes the worst-case consequence analysis and alternate scenario consequence analyses.  These analyses  comprise the hazard assessment.\n\nES 5.1 Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis for a Toxic Substance Release\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at the Old Town Mill is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a rail car containing 90 to"

Fort James Corporation considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning.  Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\n\nWorst-case dispersion modeling to estimate downwind concentrations was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.06) software.  RMP*Comp implements the consequence analysis calculations set forth in the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG). The modeling was conducted using the EPA-mandated weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability.  These low dispersion conditions occur at night with fair skies.   No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.  The toxic endpoints for toxic substances have been set by EPA in the regulation.  These values are generally equivalent to Level-2 Emergency Response Planning Guidelines which the American Industrial Hygiene Association define as the concentrations below which exposure for up to an hour will not result in irreversible or escape-impairing health effects.  \n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that t"

In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Fort James has elected to include only the modeling results obtained assuming 'rural' surface conditions. However, it should be noted that under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces located near the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint.\n\nThe modeling indicated a maximum distance of greater than 25 miles to chlorine's toxic endpoint of 3 ppmv (0.0087 mg/L). The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 120,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Old Town area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. There are no environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) located within the worst-case impact zone. \n\nThe 25-mile radius assumes that the worst-case meteorological conditions persist for eight hours.

More probable meteorological conditions at the Old Town Mill, according to National Weather Service data at Bangor, ME, are a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and D stability.

The steel vaporizer can catch fire at steam temperatures exceeding 300o F.   A fire of this type could occur due to a failure of the steam pressure reducing station resulting in a high steam temperature in the vaporizer.  Fort James has estimated that an operator could shut down the flow of chlorine by  accessing an exterior valve, resulting in a spill of approximately 179 lbs of chlorine. \n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.06) software. In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed).   No mitigation of the release was considered. Because the surface roughness in the immediate vicinity of the Old Town Mill is urban in nature and alternative releases typically result in relatively short endpoint distances, an urban surface roughness value was utilized in the alternative release modeling. \n\nThe estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.1 mile. The alternative impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 10 persons, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated in conjunction with EPA's Landview III database program and USGS maps.

In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing  of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Old Town Mill has around-the-clock communications with the LEPC to ensure notification of the public in event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response.\n\n\n\nES.7   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\nThe Fort James Corporation continually strives to improve operations at its facilities in order to reduce the potential of an accidental release to the environment. To that end, the Fort James Old Town Mill is in the process of converting the current chlorine bleaching system to an elemental chlorine free system. The new system, expected to be installed and fully operational by the end of 1999, will consist of a 100% ClO2 oxidizing bleaching system. This change will result in the complete phase out of chlorine from the Old Town Mill. The use of ClO2 greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the paper pulp bleaching process. The elimination of Cl2 in the bleaching process will also have a large effect on the worst-case distance to"
