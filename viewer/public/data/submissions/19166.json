Day and Zimmermann Hawthorne Corporation (DZHC) is the contractor for HWAD.  DZHC, handles chlorine, propane, and isopropylamine in amounts which are considered to be hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nIt is DZHC's policy to comply with all local, State, and Federal rules and regulations.  Safety and environmental concerns are a high priority for DZHC, therefore, DZHC has its own emergency responders for the HWAD.  There is a mutual aid agreement between DZHC's emergency responders and the local emergency responders (Hawthorne Volunteer Fire Department and Mineral County Emergency Response Team).\n\nThe accidental release, prevention, and emergency response policies are a unified approach that integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The emergency response policy includes a response plan specific to the particular processes.  DZHC provides training to its employees as well as emergency responders in the following disciplines; the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA), Hazardous Materials (HazMat), Hazardous Communications (HazComm), and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER), Level 3 Technician training coarse specifically for the emergency responders, Level 5 Incident Scene Commanders specifically for the emergency responders, and regular fire and emergency drills specifically for the emergency responders.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nDZHC has six processes that are subject to the RMP Rule.  \n\n  Chlorine is used to decontaminate the drinking water used at the HWAD.  There are a total of 4,300 pounds of chlorine located at the Black Beauty Reservoir at any given time which are stored in two 2,000 pound tanks and two 150 pound cylinders.\n\n  Propane is used"

There are a total of 253,352 pounds or 31,669 gallons of propane located near the golf course in the Industrial Area of HWAD at any given time which are stored in one 30,000 gallon tank and four empty additional tanks.  The 30,000 gallon tank is used to heat the housing area located on the HWAD.  The additional tanks total potential release is 1,669 gallons.  These tanks are used for incidental processes when needed on the HWAD.  Because these tanks are not in use they are stored near the 30,000 gallon tank for safety and convenience.\n\n  Isopropylamine is derived from the demilitarization of ammunition and is located at the 117-12 building in the Western Area Demilitarization Facility (WADF).  There can be a maximum total of 10,102 pounds of isopropylamine located in this ammunition storage building.\n\n  Isopropylamine is derived from the demilitarization of ammunition and is located at the 116-45 building.  There can be a maximum total of 13,177 pounds of isopropylamine located in this ammunition storage building.\n\n  Isopropylamine is derived from the demilitarization of ammunition and is located at the 116-44 building.

There can be a maximum total of 15,812 pounds of isopropylamine located in this ammunition storage building.\n\nAccess to all of these sites is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nEPA's RMP*Comp Ver 1.06 was used to define the worst case and alternate case scenarios.\n\nWorst Case Scenario Chlorine - Dropping a 2,000 pound chl"

Chlorine tanks are delivered to this facility approximately 80% full as an industry standard.  This allows for vapor expansion in varying weather conditions.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the tanks are released.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is 3.4 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.  The affected population is 188 which are located at the family housing on the HWAD.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario Chlorine - A 1.25 inch hole in the liquid space of the 2,000 pound chlorine tank causes the chlorine to travel to the lower flammability limit.  It is assumed that the entire contents of all of the tanks are released. The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit is 1.8 miles.

Propane tanks are filled on this facility approximately 80% as an industry standard.  This is to allow for vapor expansion in varying weather conditions.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nChlorine - There is a Process Safety Management program and a Hazard Analysis Program in place.\nOperator training - Operators are trained in self contained breathing apparatus.  Annual seminars are attended for continued education to maintain certification of operating a drinking water system using chlorine disinfection.  Operators are certified in potable water disinfection by the State of Nevada.  Operators are HazMat and HazComm trained as required by EPA and they have had OSHA training.  Operators are also trained to assist emergency responders as needed. \n\nPreventive Maintenance Program- There is a preventative maintenance (PM) program in place to minimize the chance of accidental releases due to equipment failure.  As part of the PM program there are audible alarms that are relayed to the guard operation center and monitored 24 hours a day.  There are daily visual checks and readings, weekly maintenance to all chlorine monitoring equipment, and all alarm systems are checked on a monthly basis.  In addition, all chlorine tubing heads are rebuilt and replaced annually and all tubing is replaced annually to prevent any leaks.\n\nAccurate and Effective Operating Procedures - There are complete sets of operating procedures in place.  The procedures address normal operations, as well as steps to be taken during upset conditions and safety precautions to be observed during all operational phases.\n\nPeriodic Hazard Reviews of Equipment and Procedures- The hazard reviews of equipment and procedures are on an annual basis and when major physical changes are made to the process.\n\nAuditing and Insp"

The DZHC Medical Clinic is available for treatment of non-critical situations and victims can be transferred to a full-service hospital via ambulance or airlifted to a larger hospital in serious cases.  Security maintains a 24 hour dispatch center for Security and the Fire Department.  All alarms are received at the dispatch center and then dispatched to the Fire Department by pager, radio, or telephone.  All emergency responders are trained extensively in propane incidents, chlorine, and in leak control measures for chemicals.\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nDZHC is continually looking for new innovative ideas for water disinfection.  The isopropylamine processes will be completed by the end of August 1999. Training of all personnel involved with these hazards will continue.  Meetings and improvement discussions will also continue as they currently are unless changes are required (i.e. the need for improvements or the discontinuation of a process).  DZHC will continue to follow local, state, and federal rules and regulations as well as our own stringent rules and regulations.  Improvements are being made to our emergency responders on the mitigation of a major incident or disaster."
