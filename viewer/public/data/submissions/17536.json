The Facility Policy BOONVILLE PROPANE\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of WARRICK County Coop should occur; the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities.  To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nA primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nB Propane is received, stored, and distributed in our farmer customers for both heat and fuel. \n\nC The maximum quantity stored would be 99892 pounds in the largest storage tanks.  The largest of which is 26,000 gallons.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a TANK TRUCK holding 9000 GALLONS.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 199892 lbs.  This represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the flammable endpoint is .4 miles.\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the flammable endpoint is .1 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), NFPA 58 & the uniform Fire code.\n\n5. The five-year Accident History \n\nTHERE have been no accidents that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant properly damage at the facility; nor To our knowledge, have resulted in offside deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.
