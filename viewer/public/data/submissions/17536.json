This represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the flammable endpoint is .4 miles.\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the flammable endpoint is .1 miles.\n\n4.
