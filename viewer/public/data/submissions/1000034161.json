Preventive maintenance programs, training programs, and Management of Change (MOC) have all been developed to help achieve this goal. PHA is conducted not only in the project phase of the facility life cycle, but also in the operating phase to identify and address potential causes of incidents. When incidents do occur, investigations are conducted, corrective actions are proposed, and modifications are made to prevent further occurrences. The likelihood of success of these and other PSM, efforts is enhanced by, or in some cases is dependent upon, accurate, effective documentation. It may not be possible to prevent every incident. Thus, the second goal of PSM is to minimize the hazardous consequences of incidents that do occur. The objectives of these stages of protection should be documented via design drawings, operating procedures, maintenance procedures and training requirements. Thi"

This reduces the likelihood that the protections will be compromised during the operating life of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe third goal of PSM is to enhance compliance with industry initiatives such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care program or the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 750, and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation of procedures and audit results enhances the confidence of the public, and of regulatory bodies, that industry is being a good corporate citizen.\n\n\n\nAmong the many benefits of good and comprehensive process safety docu?mentation are the following:\n\n\n\n?    an ability to link all elements of the PSM program together (e.g., training is linked to procedures, procedures are linked to PHA);\n\n?    historical data are preserved for future use throughout the life cycle of a facility, providing an institutional memory that is independent of personnel;\n\n?    documentation of safety reviews and related topics is available for periodic audit. This provides a mechanism for identifying deviations before they result in incidents;\n\n?    regulatory compliance is facilitated. Some regulatory requirements are specifically document oriented, and the organized assemblage of PSM documentation greatly assists in providing the necessary information;\n\n?    incidents can be reduced through prevention because the increased information that is documented improves the understanding of hazards; and\n\n?    downtime can be reduced, resulting in more profitable operations.\n\n\n\n1.1 Summary\n\n\n\nProper use of good documentation should be part of a quality PSM program that communicates to employees and to the community a commitment to safety.

Most releases are incidental, requiring minimal, yet timely clean up. These are not emergency response situations; they can be taken care of by anyone familiar with the chemical and trained in cleaning it up. Our specific policy for incidental releases is follow Hazwoper plan, EAP, and notify emergency response.\n\n\n\nA non-incidental release requires a much more concentrated action. In general, the prescribed response to a non-incidental release is Follow Hazwoper plan, EAP, and notifies emergency response.\n\n\n\nBy knowing what to expect, we can be better prepared to handle the spill or leak that does happen.
