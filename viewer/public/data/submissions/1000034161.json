Therefore, the ammonia spilled in this scenario would be {3.14 x (1/144) x 30 x 7.5 plus 0.25 x 40} gallons x 5.17 pounds per gallon, which equals {4.91 plus 10} x 5.17 pounds per gallon, which equals 77.1 pounds.

Preventive maintenance programs, training programs, and Management of Change (MOC) have all been developed to help achieve this goal. PHA is conducted not only in the project phase of the facility life cycle, but also in the operating phase to identify and address potential causes of incidents. When incidents do occur, investigations are conducted, corrective actions are proposed, and modifications are made to prevent further occurrences. The likelihood of success of these and other PSM, efforts is enhanced by, or in some cases is dependent upon, accurate, effective documentation. It may not be possible to prevent every incident. Thus, the second goal of PSM is to minimize the hazardous consequences of incidents that do occur. The objectives of these stages of protection should be documented via design drawings, operating procedures, maintenance procedures and training requirements. Thi"

This reduces the likelihood that the protections will be compromised during the operating life of the facility.\r\n\r\nThe third goal of PSM is to enhance compliance with industry initiatives such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care program or the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 750, and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation of procedures and audit results enhances the confidence of the public, and of regulatory bodies, that industry is being a good corporate citizen.\r\n\r\nAmong the many benefits of good and comprehensive process safety docu\u00acmentation are the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tan ability to link all elements of the PSM program together (e.g., training is linked to procedures, procedures are linked to PHA);\r\n\u00bf\thistorical data are preserved for future use throughout the life cycle of a facility, providing an institutional memory that is independent of personnel;\r\n\u00bf\tdocumentation of safety reviews and related topics is available for periodic audit.

Explanation\r\nTo produce 1000 lbs. of product (ammonium chloride) we feed 318 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia + (682 + 1240) lbs. 22 Baume acid and get product plus 1240 lbs. of H2O.\r\nAlso for every 1000 lbs. of product there is 280,000 BTU of heat liberated.\r\nIt takes 1000 BTU to evaporate 1 lb. of water of 280 lbs. of water will be evaporated in the reaction.\r\nTherefore we subtract 280 lbs. of water from the 1240 lbs. available we have 960 lbs. of water left.\r\n\r\nThe reaction therefore produces 682/1642 x 100 = 41.5% concentrated solution. Because this solution is too thick to work with, we provide a water addition to bring the concentration back to 35%. This 35% synthetic feed stock is now ready to feed to the crystallization process for the production of ammonium chloride.\r\n1.\tMaximum intended inventory\r\n2.\tSafe upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows, and for compositions.\r\n3.\tConsequences of deviations, including the safety and health of employees.\r\n\r\nC.\tPROCESS EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThe information shall consist of at least the following:\r\n1.\tMaterials of construction\r\n2.\tPiping and instrument diagrams\r\n3.\tElectrical classification\r\n4.\tRelief system design and design basis\r\n5.\tVentilation system design\r\n6.\tMaterial and energy balance for process built after May 26, 1992.\r\n7.\tSafety systems such as interlocks, detection and suppression systems.\r\n\r\nD.

We have developed emergency response capabilities that are appropriate to the individual situations. The method we use to staff the emergency response team is Operators on shift. The team consists of seven people.\r\n\r\nWe have people from every work shift on the ERT. Our ERT is trained in the following manner: Hazwoper All the employees that are expected to respond are:\r\n\u00bf\tAdequately trained for their intended job duties.\r\n\u00bf\tProperly equipped for the intended tasks.\r\n\u00bf\tCapable of responding in a safe manner, and\r\n\u00bf\tManaged by competent leaders.\r\n\r\nWe use off-site emergency personnel in some instances.\r\n\r\nRESPONSE ACTIONS\r\n\r\nAs is true in most industrial settings, spills can occur in a variety of locations at our facility. Most releases are incidental, requiring minimal, yet timely clean up. These are not emergency response situations; they can be taken care of by anyone familiar with the chemical and trained in cleaning it up. Our specific policy for incidental releases is follow Hazwoper plan, EAP, and notify emergency response.\r\n\r\nA non-incidental release requires a much more concentrated action. In general, the prescribed response to a non-incidental release is Follow Hazwoper plan, EAP, and notifies emergency response.\r\n\r\nBy knowing what to expect, we can be better prepared to handle the spill or leak that does happen. The types of emergency release situations most likely to occur at our facility are NH3/HCl.\r\n\r\nSUPPLIES\r\n\r\nWe also provide the following personal protective equipment (PPE): Scott air packs and Class A suits.\r\n\r\nBLUEPRINT FOR RESPONSE\r\n\r\nPersonnel roles, lines of authority, and lines of communication regarding emergency response are follows: Employees that are trained Hazwoper are to assist to"
