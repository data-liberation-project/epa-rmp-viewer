(Rise Baking Company Manteno) facility located at 1340 Sycamore Street in Manteno, Illinois for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G.\r\n\r\nII.\tRise Baking Company Manteno Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rise Baking Company Manteno; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Rise Baking Company Manteno is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Rise Baking Company Manteno' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Rise Baking Company Manteno has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII.\tFacility Identification\r\nThe Rise Baking Company Manteno facility is located at 1340 Sycamor"

The facility is a producer of custom and branded snack cakes and muffins primarily for retail distribution. \r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311813. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating baked goods ingredients and products. \r\nThe approximate ammonia charge for the refrigeration system has been calculated at 17,500 pounds. The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks, and blast freezers.   \r\n\r\nIV.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that manage ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program and RMP was conducted on January 28, 2015. The next audit will be conducted by January 28, 2018, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  \r\n\r\nV.\tFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe Rise Baking Company Manteno facility has not had an accidental anhydrous ammonia release, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years. However, small nuisance releases have been investigated in order to prevent repeat occurrences.\r\n\r\nVI.\tEmergency Response Program\r\nRise Baking Company Manteno has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitiga"

Rise Baking Company Manteno has communicated and trained facility employees on proper evacuation procedures and has interacted (i.e., onsite inspections) with the Manteno Fire Department. \r\nRise Baking Company Manteno has coordinated their EAP with the Kankakee County ESDA and the Manteno Fire Department.  This coordination effort included providing each agency with a copy of our EAP, providing each with a site diagram and hazardous material information, meeting with Manteno Fire Department personnel to discuss the facilities operations/processes, and encouraging periodic on-site inspections and coordination with Manteno Fire Department personnel.\r\nRise Baking Company Manteno' hazardous materials response team will be responsible for investigating and assisting the Manteno Fire Department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia.  The facility has three (3) windsocks onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release and evacuation of the building.\r\n\r\nVII.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nChemical safety is an important part of Rise Baking Company Manteno operations. Rise Baking Company Manteno is currently implementing their Process Safety Management Program. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Rise Baking Company Manteno. \r\n\r\nVIII.\tManagement Program\r\nRise Baking Company Manteno has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented, and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document."
