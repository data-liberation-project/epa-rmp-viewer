This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at the Costco Wholesale Meat Plant in Tracy, California.\n\nIt is the policy of Costco Wholesale to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  To accomplish the company\u0092s goal in minimizing accidental losses, the company has established safety programs that enable facility personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare facility personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\nCostco Wholesale draws from several sources and decades of experience + expertise to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  Internal facility personnel with decades of collective experience, the resources of a professional refrigeration contractor, in addition to external risk management consultants all provide guidance to limit the risks of handling ammonia.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the facility\u0092s safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with Cal-OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, CCR Title 8 5189), EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68), and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program"

The Refrigeration / Maintenance Department has the primary responsibility for implementation of the RMP and PSM policies aimed at reducing the hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nIt is the policy of the Costco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  If such a release does occur, the facility\u0092s personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Tracy Rural Fire Protection District, the South San Joaquin County Fire Authority, as well as the local Hazardous Materials Response team, who provide additional emergency response expertise and support as needed.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility processes ground beef and hot dogs and produces several packaged meat products that are sold in Costco Wholesale retail locations worldwide.  The facility is located at 17880 W. Schulte Road in Tracy, California.  The ammonia refrigeration system was commissioned in 2005 and was built in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical and Fire Codes.  An expansion in 2010 enabled the plant to manufacture hot dogs that are sold in the retail locations (food courts and stores).\n\nCostco Wholesale Tracy Meat Plant\u0092s ammonia refrigeration system has a maximum intended inventory of 45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, that is used in meat processing equipment (including quick freezing), warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in two compressor rooms (Main Plant and Hot Dog engine rooms) including the vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roofs and all of the evaporators and process freezers are located in their respective production / cold storage areas.\n\nThe accidental release prevention progr"

All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the plant operates continuously based on operational + temperature demands.  The machinery rooms house the primary equipment including compressors, recirculator packages with pumps, and auxiliary components, while the condensers are located above each machinery room on the facility roof.  The evaporators, freezers, chillers, and other refrigeration process applications are located throughout the facility at / near each refrigerated zone (independently temperature controlled).\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to move heat from product, secondary coolants (glycol), and cold storage rooms to the outside atmosphere.  When heat is absorbed by the liquid ammonia, it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers (outside), where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor to the atmosphere, causing the ammonia to condense to a liquid, which drains back into the high pressure vessels.\n\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the ammonia refrigeration system including:  ammonia leak detection with stack light alarm annunciators, pressure relief system w/ water diffusion tanks, emergency refrigerant control boxes, auto purgers to remove non-condensible gasses, and a refrigeration control system.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed for the Costco Wholesale facility to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequenc"

To help coordinate the various elements of the program, a management system has been established that defines responsible parties to ensure upkeep and implementation of each policy within the RMP and PSM programs.  Compliance Audits are also conducted every 3 years that can identify potential gaps in compliance and recommend actions to achieve full compliance.\n\nSeveral departments within the facility (Refrigeration, Administration, and Safety) as well as outside resources (Ammonia Refrigeration Contractors, and a Risk Management Consultant) help to ensure the appropriate and ongoing implementation (with recordkeeping) of the various elements of the programs.  PSM Team Meetings include discussions regarding outstanding corrective action items, planned design changes to the ammonia system (if any), changes in personnel, reviewing evacuation drill results, etc.  Any significant issues that are identified are brought to plant leadership to ensure appropriate resources are allocated for timely resolutions.\n\nThe ultimate goal for Costco Wholesale\u0092s PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid adverse impacts to the environment.  These programs enable the facility to operate the refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.

The facility utilizes in-house Refrigeration Mechanics for Daily Ammonia System Rounds (w/ log sheet) to monitor system parameters and to alert Management if any conditions are out of range.   Ammonia refrigeration contractors are also assigned the duties for various routine inspections and preventative maintenance tasks + service.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety design features including ammonia leak detectors, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, emergency stop controls, and Emergency Refrigerant Control Boxes.  In addition, all pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to ensure the integrity of the vessel and associated piping is protected.
