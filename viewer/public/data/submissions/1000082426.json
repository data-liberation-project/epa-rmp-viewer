The site has continuous training in the Training Registration module within OCI's MESH system (company-wide HSE database).  The assigned courses are automatically sent out on a set frequency to the employees based on their job description.  Some topics that are part of IFCo's training portfolio include: Confined Space Entry Training, Industrial Exterior Fire Brigade Training, CPR, Pressurized Flammable Gas Fire Training, Hazmat Technician Training.  Table top exercises are held with local LEPC and Trans Canada (Natural Gas Pipeline into the IFCo plant).  Site wide safety drills are being conducted to discover if/and/or where the  deficiencies are.  Local emergency responders, LEPC's, hospitals and med-vac services are all invited to join IFCo employee's in these drills.

IFCo strives to continually improve its safety program and to reward employees for outstanding safety performance. IFCo has adopted the Safe Start Program.  The program has been rolled out to all employee's on site (and to the new employees as they are hired).  IFCo is using the DuPont Safety Perception Survey as a way to measure gaps.

The audit team will include at least one employee knowledgeable in IFCo and in the audit process. At the conclusion of the audit, the audit team submits a report to IFCo.

The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes at IFCo. Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and/or human error. In addition to the accident prevention program activities, IFCo has safety features on many units to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. \r\n\r\nThe following types of safety features are used in various processes: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tHydrocarbon and Ammonia detectors with alarms \r\n\u00bf\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases \r\n\u00bf\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated) \r\n\u00bf\tDouble Wall Ammonia St"

Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials prior to opening process piping or equipment, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training, help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\nAny modification that creates a change in existing process safety information and change in equipment must go through a documented process of verification. The management of change (MOC) process is a system of checks and balances and performing adequate reviews by knowledgeable personnel to ensure safe operation of the process. The process also ensures that all affected process safety information is updated to reflect the change, and that the safety of the modification has been evaluated before startup. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation and Event Notices \r\nIFCo has a procedure that requires an investigation of all incidents which resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personnel injury within 48 hours.

Operators receive classroom, field training, exercise and simulation training. Operators are required to demonstrate their knowledge through tests, skill demonstrations and have adequate knowledge to perform job duties and tasks in a safe manner. Refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more often if needed. All training information is documented. \r\n\r\nContractors \r\nIFCo has developed a Contractor Safety Program to satisfy PSM guidelines by extending plant safety requirements to non-IFCo employees working within the site. The Program is intended to maintain a plant-wide, consistent level of safe work performance. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, IFCo has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform IFCo personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Should a release occur, our personnel are trained to respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nIFCo was constructed from 2012 forward and began Ammonia production in April of 2017.  \r\n\r\nThe principal raw materials used are: natural gas (which is delivered by pipeline), air and water.  The facility will manufacture anhydrous ammonia, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), granular urea, and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF).  Liquid urea, ammonium nitrate, and nitric acid will be produced as intermediate products.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at low pressure in two storage tanks that consist of a tank within a tank.  This product will be transported by truck.  All final products will be transported from the facility by either truck or rail.   Granular urea is produced by supplying a pressurized urea solution (typically 97%) into injection heads to produce a finely atomized spray which travels upwards into a circulating bed of granular particles.  Urea formaldehyde solution is injected into this process as an anti-caking agent which allows free product flow, low dust content, and high stability for storage and shipment.\r\n\r\nThe main process units at IFCo are the Ammonia and Urea processes and supporting facilities.\r\n\r\nDescription of covered chemicals:\r\nIFCo handles and stores Ammonia, Formaldehyde, Hydrogen, and Methane and mixtures containing these regulated EPA chemicals.\r\n\r\nDescription of Worst case scenario:\r\nThe worst case scenario for toxic chemicals and flammable materials are described in th"
