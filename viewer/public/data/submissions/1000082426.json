This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Should a release occur, our personnel are trained to respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nIFCo was constructed from 2012 forward and began Ammonia production in April of 2017.  \n\n\n\nThe principal raw materials used are: natural gas (which is delivered by pipeline), air and water.  The facility will manufacture anhydrous ammonia, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), granular urea, and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF).  Liquid urea, ammonium nitrate, and nitric acid will be produced as intermediate products.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at low pressure in two storage tanks that consist of a tank within a tank.  This product will be transported by truck.  All final products will be transported from the facility by either truck or rail.   Granular urea is produced by supplying a pressurized urea solution (typically 97%) into injection heads to produce a finely atomized spray which travels upwards into a circulating bed of granular particles.  Urea formaldehyde solution is injected into this process as an anti-caking agent which allows free product flow, low dust content, and high stability for storage and shipment.\n\n\n\nThe main process units at IFCo are the Ammonia and Urea processes and supporting facilities.\n\n\n\nDescription of covered chemicals:\n\nIFCo handles and stores Ammonia, Formaldehyde, Hydrogen, and Methane and mixtures containing these regulated EPA chemicals.\n\n\n\nDescription of Worst case scenario:\n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic chemicals and flammable materials are described in th"

EPA's RMP Comp program was utilized to evaluate alternative release scenarios assuming 3 meter/sec wind and stability class D.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps: \n\nThe following summary describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at IFCo. IFCo is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and has procedures and standards for each PSM element. A summary of these programs and standards are listed as below: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nIFCo encourages employees and contractors to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Each IFCo department is responsible for ensuring employee participation within their department. The management system policy for each PSM element identifies responsibilities that are more specific. Examples of employee participation include involvement in pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, job hazard analysis, reviewing procedures, participation in training and incident investigations. In addition, IFCo has a safety committee and town hall meeting forums during which employees and contractors can address both process safety and occupational safety issues. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nIFCo maintains information pertaining to the highly hazardous materials used or produced at the facility, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used. Information is readily available and is updated when changes are made in accordance with management of change procedures.  Safety Data Sheets and other various technical documents are used to facilitate safe operation of the processes. The documents address limits for key "

Potential offsite consequences are considered as part of this evaluation. IFCo currently uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method of analysis. Each analysis is conducted by a cross-functional team and facilitated by someone familiar with both IFCo and HAZOP methodology. \n\n\n\nAs safety concerns are evaluated, they are ranked according to probability and consequence. All concerns are documented as part of the HAZOP process. Safety concerns that warrant action are formally documented as recommendations and passed on to an individual or department that will be responsible for resolution.  The PSM group manages tracking of the Process Hazards Analysis action items to completion.\n\n\n\nThe site process hazard analysis guidelines requires a periodic review at least every five years which must continue throughout the life of the process. The results of these updates are documented and retained for the life of the process. Updated findings are stewarded for resolution and tracked.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\nIFCo has developed and compiled a comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction for the safe operation of IFCo processes. Procedures provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations including: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process, 7) emergency operations, and 8) startup following an abnormal or emergency shutdown. \n\nEach procedure developed is reviewed for accuracy, consistency, and completeness.

Resolution to each recommendation is documented and retained. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits \n\nAs per the site Compliance Audit procedure, at least once every three years IFCo is subject to a compliance audit. The audit team will include at least one employee knowledgeable in IFCo and in the audit process. At the conclusion of the audit, the audit team submits a report to IFCo. IFCo management makes appropriate responses to each finding in the report, and takes steps necessary to correct any deficiencies detected by the audit. Resolution of the audit findings is documented. As required by 29 CFR 1910.119(o), IFCo retains the two most recent audit reports. \n\n\n\nTrade Secrets \n\nIFCo withholds no information necessary for employees to safely carry out their assigned job tasks. If necessary, IFCo management may require a confidentiality agreement with certain employees and contractors in order to protect trade secrets or other proprietary information.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe processes at IFCo involve hazards that must be managed to ensure constant safe operation. The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes at IFCo. Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and/or human error. In addition to the accident prevention program activities, IFCo has safety features on many units to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. \n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\n\n\n?

Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified per site operating procedure standards.\n\n\n\nTraining \n\nIFCo has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or utility. Operators receive classroom, field training, exercise and simulation training. Operators are required to demonstrate their knowledge through tests, skill demonstrations and have adequate knowledge to perform job duties and tasks in a safe manner. Refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more often if needed. All training information is documented. \n\n\n\nContractors \n\nIFCo has developed a Contractor Safety Program to satisfy PSM guidelines by extending plant safety requirements to non-IFCo employees working within the site. The Program is intended to maintain a plant-wide, consistent level of safe work performance. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, IFCo has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform IFCo personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, IFCo evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractors.

Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials prior to opening process piping or equipment, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training, help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\nAny modification that creates a change in existing process safety information and change in equipment must go through a documented process of verification. The management of change (MOC) process is a system of checks and balances and performing adequate reviews by knowledgeable personnel to ensure safe operation of the process. The process also ensures that all affected process safety information is updated to reflect the change, and that the safety of the modification has been evaluated before startup. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation and Event Notices \n\nIFCo has a procedure that requires an investigation of all incidents which resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personnel injury within 48 hours.
