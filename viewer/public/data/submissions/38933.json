The plant generates approximately 454 MWs of electricity which is sold to the local utility Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and also provides pressurized steam to a neighboring petrochemical facility owned by Chevron Phillips Puerto Rico Core which is located to the east of the facility.  The facility began commercial operation on November 29, 2002.\n\nThe facility is located on an 85 acre tract of land owned by AES Puerto Rico.  The facility also occupies associated rights of ways for transmission lines, conveyors, make-up water supply lines, process steam piping and roads.  To the south of the facility is an area of wetlands, the Las Mareas Harbor and the Caribbean Sea.  To the north and northwest are vacant lots, State Road #3, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Baxter Pharmaceuticals and Chemsource.  Directly west is a vacant lot with wetlands.\n\nThe facility consists of two boiler and steam turbine units, a wet cooling tower, water treatment, coal, limestone and ash handling systems.  The boilers are coal fired Circulating Fluidized Bed boilers with NOx, SOx and particulate matter air emissions control equipment.  Coal is delivered by ocean vessel to the docking facility at the Las Mareas Harbor.  Limestone is also delivered by ocean vessel or by truck.  All other plant consumables such as #2 fuel oil, propane, chlorine, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide and urea are delivered by truck.  \n       \nIt is the desire of the management of the AES Puerto Rico project to operate the plant in compliance with all applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as part of the facility's regulatory requirements for the storage and use up to 26,600 pounds of chlorine.  #2 fuel oil and propane are also stored on site above threshold quantities, but are not included in the RMP due to the fact they are used as fuels and i"
