      "SummaryText": "RODUCTS\n\n\n\nAmmonia solutions and chlorine are used in the water treatment industry. The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to the employees of the company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations. These chemicals are not packaged at the Lancaster site. The site receives the chemicals in packages, places them in storage, and then ships them to customers.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBrenntag Southwest maintains emergency equipment specifically designed for use in an emergency to stop leaks from product containers.  Brenntag maintains employees who are trained in the specialized use of this emergency equipment and maintains agreements with area response companies equipped to respond to emergencies.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include an Emergency Response Plan, Fire Prevention Plan, and a Transportation Emergency Plan.  These plans require the facility to maintain an open door policy with local fire departments and other emergency agencies in the area, and to invite emergency responders from both the public and private sectors to tour the facility annually in order to gain knowledge of the physical setup and processes of the plant.  This information becomes very valuable during an emergency incident.  These plans also direct the facility to maintain a working relationship with area clinics and hospitals in order to be prepared during an emergency event.   \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBrenntag Southwest, Inc., maintains Health, Safety, and Environmental policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach, Hazard Communication, and Process Safety Management among others.
