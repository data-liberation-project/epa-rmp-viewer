If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n                                                                                                                                                                      \n2. Facility Information                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                            Dayton  Chemicals is a small independent retail facility whose primary activity is the storage and handling of  anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient to area farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one 20,185-gallon storage tank at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 91,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA.  The worst-case release scenario is failure of the storage tank, when filled to 85% capacity as limited by regulation, releasing 91,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.00 miles. The alternative release scenario is the release of 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a 2\" transfer hose break. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,ANSI K61.1, published by the American National Standards I"

The Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe facility's emergency action policy was developed in accordance with the following regulations:OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200, Hazard Communication.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety. \n\nSafety improvment is an ongoing process at the facility.
