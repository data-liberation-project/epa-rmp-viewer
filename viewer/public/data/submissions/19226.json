The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B '68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.

The worst-case release area for the chlorine systems would contain the area impacted by the worst-case release for the Processing and Slaughter ammonia systems.

(IBP) Dakota City, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to IBP employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all IBP owned activities at this facility.\nIBP's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nFacility Description\nIBP operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  IBP operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, tallow, and other rendered products.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\nThree chemicals are utilized or generated at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are chlorine, ammonia, and methane.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant and to treat wastewater, ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility, and methane is generated as an off-gas from the anaerobic lagoons in the wastewater treatment plant.\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.

HGSYSTEM is a consequence model that has seven distinct modules that are used to predict the potential ambient concentrations resulting from single (gas) and two-phase jet (gas and aerosol) releases from pressurized vessels, vapor releases, liquid spills and the subsequent evaporation of the spill pool.  HGSYSTEM was selected for this application because of its flexibility in simulating the necessary release characteristics, plume dispersion (e.g., dense gas dispersion), and its capability of simulating the dispersion environment through which the plume travels (e.g., time varying meteorological conditions).\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine included a release of all the contents of the storage vessel (2,000 pounds) in a 10-minute period.  This release translates to a release rate of 200 lbs/min.  Other assumptions for the worst-case chlorine analysis include the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the 1-ton cylinder is not diked; no passive mitigation system (including buildings) are in place; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the windspeed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the regulatory defined endpoint of 3.0 ppm is found to occur at a distance of 3.23 miles (5.2 kilometers) from the release point.\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from a fusible plug failure that leads to the release of the entire contents of the 1-ton chlorine cylinder.  Based on information in the Chlorine Institute Chlorine Handbook, the release rate of vaporized chlorine from the fusible plug opening is an average of 14.6 lbs/min.  Based on the calculated release rate of 14.6 lbs/min, the duration of a 2,000-pound release is 136 minutes.  The model assumes no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place.

The results of the alternative-release scenario for a chlorine release indicates that the endpoint of 3.0 ppm is reached at a downwind distance of 0.31 miles (500 meters) from the release point.\nAmmonia\nThe data provided in the document Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid, the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the new high pressure receiver number in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 57,708 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 5,770.8 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the new high pressure receiver is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).

The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 90 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 90 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 64.5pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of IBP's operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 64.5 lbs/min, the duration for a 500-pound release is 7.8 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicate that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.073 miles (117 meters) from the release point.\nMethane\nThe wastewater treatment facility operates two covered anaerobic lagoons.  The lagoons are identical in design.  The worst-case release scenario for methane is defined as a release of all the contents of one of the covered anaerobic lagoons (39,336 pounds).  For the worst-case release of methane, the release rate is not considered.  The total quantity of the methane is assumed to form a vapor cloud.  The entire contents of the cloud are assumed to be within the flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to explode.

The results of the worst-case assessment for methane show that the 1-psi overpressure endpoint occurs at a distance of 0.28 miles (455 meters) from the release point.\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the methane system is a release resulting from the flare failure.  Based on the capacity of the blower, the release rate is 17 pounds of methane gas per minute.  To estimate the impact distance for this alternative-release scenario, a vapor cloud fire was assumed to occur.  The distance to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences.  The LFL for methane is 33 mg/L (EPA guidance document).  In accordance with USEPA guidance, the modeling assumptions were that methane is a buoyant gas and an urban dispersion environment exists in the nearfield.

IBP has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by IBP management.

Neither of these releases affected the public or the environment.  Both releases were small and did not require an incident investigation.  Therefore, IBP does not have records of the time and duration of the releases or the release quantities of these releases.  IBP has assumed, after reasonable inquiry, the time of the incident is 12:00 PM, lasted one minute, and released one pound of ammonia.\nEmergency Response Program\nIBP has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  These personnel receive semiannual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\nIBP does not have emergency response capability on site to respond to a methane emergency. It is IBP's policy to contact off-site emergency responders for assistance in the event of an accidental release of methane.\nIBP's employees will attempt to extinguish small fires with fire extinguishers if they have been properly trained.  IBP's employees, trained in the safe operation of the methane system, will close manual shutoff valves to terminate the flow of methane if the valves can be safely approached.  For all other scenarios, IBP's employees will evacuate the area and allow off-site responders to respond to the emergency.\nIBP has met with the local fire department to review the methane system and to establish coordination and communication procedures.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIBP completes a thorough review of the ammonia systems, chlorine systems, and the methane flare system each time a design change is implemented.  IBP is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
