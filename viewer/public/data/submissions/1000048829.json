The Refinery occupies approximately 63 acres of land located in the city of Paramount in Southern California. The site is bordered on the north by Contreras Street, on the south by Somerset Boulevard and Southern Pacific Railroad track, on the east by Lakewood Boulevard and on the west by Downey Avenue. On the north side of the refinery, a trailer park, a shopping center, Wirtz Elementary School and single-family houses are located. On the west side, Paramount High School and a housing development are located. On the east side, there are single-family homes and mobile home development.  Across the railroad tracks on the south side is an apartment complex. \n\n\n\nThe primary business of the Paramount Refinery is the processing of local crude oils to finished hydrocarbon products, primarily asphalts for road construction and roofing materials, as well as reformulated gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD).  The present rated capacity of the refinery is 55 KBPD of crude.\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP requirements (40 CFR Part 68).  PPC - Paramount Refinery is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The PPC - Paramount Refinery staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, during the petroleum refining process.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nPPC - Paramount Refinery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered processes.  PPC - Paramount Refinery policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED S"

The ERP includes:\n\n-    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n\n-    Evacuation Procedures\n\n-    Safety and Health Considerations\n\n-    Notification Procedures\n\nThe ERP is implemented through an Incident Command System (ICS). The ICS has two levels of application.  Small emergencies are responded to by an Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of a Shift Incident Commander, Team Leader, and a team of members responsible for coordinating issues related to offsite releases, rescue, and hazardous materials spills. The Shift Incident Commander also coordinates with the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) via telephone. \n\nFor larger emergencies the Director of Safety and Process Safety Management serves as the Incident Commander. An Emergency Management Team (EMT) may also be activated to assist, which is lead by the Vice President of Refining.  Other members of the EMT are members of the refinery senior management. The ERT, which may have initially responded to the emergency, relinquishes incident management to the Director of Safety and Process Safety Management when the latter assumes command and then provides support to the EMT. The Director of Safety and Process Safety Management communicates with the LACoFD and other outside agencies by telephone.  Refinery personnel assigned to ERT or EMT responsibilities receive continued training.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nParamount has a tracking system for implementing recommendations that result from Process Hazard Analyses. There is a continuing training and certification program in place."
