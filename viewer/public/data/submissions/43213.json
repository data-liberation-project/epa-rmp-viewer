      "SummaryText": "Welch Foods, Inc. (Welch?s) is a membership cooperative marketing association representing fruit growers. The Welch?s facility in Lawton, Michigan is comprised of one fruit juice processing plant owned by Welch?s. The facility is involved in the production of concentrated fruit juices and by-products. The two-processes located within the facility boundary use ammonia, a chemical subject to RMP regulation, for refrigeration purposes. These processes are the Central Refrigeration System and the Freezer System. The ammonia content within these systems exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for RMP applicability.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Welch?s developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect workers and the surrounding community from exposure to anhydrous ammonia. This program was originally developed in 2000, and has not undergone any significant update since that time. Although the PSM program has not been fully updated since its inception, the facility has not undergone any significant modifications to its operation or throughput besides standard improvements. The program has been maintained, and periodic facility reviews are conducted. Welch?s expects to update the entire PSM, including the PHA and ERP, within the next year.\n\nDuring the original PSM program development, the facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for ammonia using a modified ?What-If?/Checklist? approach. The checklist was an industry standard assessment developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Welch?s facility and experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm. \n\nWelch?s implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The plan includes a preven"

      "SummaryText": "tative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Welch?s facility?s Emergency Response Plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations. As stated above, Welch?s expects to update the entire PSM, including the PHA and ERP, within the next year.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Welch?s performed an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) for a potential accidental release of ammonia. Both a worst-case and alternative-case (more realistic) were examine. Results of the OCA analysis are provided in the RMP*Submit form.\n\nWelch?s is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the ammonia refrigeration processes. Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system. Facility personnel at all levels have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia, and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding Welch?s RMP compliance should be addressed to the Plant Engineer."
