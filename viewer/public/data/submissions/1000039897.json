The City will take every reasonable action to prevent accidental\n\nreleases of chlorine. We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting processes\n\navailable.\n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP). The City is currently coordinating with the local Fire Department for\n\nresponse to chlorine emergencies. Onsite employees are trained to evacuate the site and call the Fire\n\nDepartment if a chlorine leak is detected. The Fire Department visits the site each year to remain familiar\n\nwith the chlorine system and its risks.\n\nThe Stationary Source. The stationary source is the gaseous chlorine disinfection system at this municipal\n\nwater filtration plant. Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance handled at this facility. The\n\nchlorine system has a maximum inventory of 4,000 pounds. This quantity qualifies the chlorine system as a\n\nProgram 3 process.\n\nThe Worse-Case Scenario. The worst case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine tank. The volume of\n\nthe storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be released. In the worst-case\n\nscenario, this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents onto the ground in ten minutes. Using the EPA\n\nlookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario. The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a hole in\n\na pipe. Based on a 1/16 inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 100 pounds of chlorine during a\n\nten-minute release. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1\n\nmiles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program. The accidental release prevention program includes a combination\n\nof design, training, and inspecting. The chlorine system was designed according to current codes and\n\nspecifications, and adheres to good ope"

      "SummaryText": "rating practice. The operators and contractors who work in and\n\naround the chlorine equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures. We have\n\na detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the chlorine\n\nequipment.\n\nFive Year Accident History. There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP). The Water Treatment Facility has a written ERP that includes\n\nspecific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine. Employees are trained to\n\nevacuate the facility and call the Fire Department when a chlorine leak is detected. Any large or uncontrolled\n\nrelease will require assistance from offsite responding agencies. The ERP plan states the specific procedures\n\nfor informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release. The ERP also\n\nincludes information on emergency health care for exposure to chlorine. The ERP was last reviewed on\n\nOctober 2, 2013. ERP training for all employees was last conducted in June 2013. The ERP is coordinated\n\nwith the Fire Department. The contact is the Fire Chief, at telephone (716) 693-2201. The facility is also\n\nsubject to OSHA 1910.38.\n\n"
