      "SummaryText": "We at the City of Pahokee Water Treatment Plant do all we can to promote safety at the work place.  This is especially true when it comes to handling hazardous materials.  We have safety equipment and leak detectors as well as policies and procedures in effect to protect not anly the employees but also the general public from any hazardous releases.  Our primary function is the treatment of lake Okeechobee water into drinking water for the community of Pahokee and Canal Point.  To this end we use Chlorine gas in the treatment process for color recuctiona and disinfection.  We currently store on site a three month supply of chlorine gas, approximately 12,000 pounds, or six one ton steel containers.  As part of  developing this risk management plan we were required to examine a worst case scenario.  In this scenario a chlorine cylinder is s;lit open and the entire contents are spilt out wihin ten minutes.  If this were to happen the toxic cloud would extend out in alldirections from the plant a distance of 9/10thsw of a mile.  This model is based on EPA's guidance program RMP comp.  With the plant being in the center of town this would have a direct impact on the majority of the city residences as well as the three public schools.  While the chances of this happening are so slim as to be unthinkable it was required to be conisdered.  As an alternative to the worst case scenario we were required to look at another possiblity of our own choosing.  I selected a slightly more plausible scenario, a fuseable plug failing.  All chlorine cylinders contain fuseable plugs, which are there to protect the cylinders for over pressurization.  If one was to fail at night after shutdown and not be discovered before startup in the morning, the resulting toxic cloud would extend out in all directions from the plant for 4/10ths of a mile.  Again we used RMP Comp to establish this area.  At this level the cloud would not reach Pahokee Elementary and would only effect some residences.  As"

      "SummaryText": "part of our plan to minimize any potential threat to the businesses and residences of Pahokee, the operators of the water treatment plant are trained on an annual basis on the handling of chlorine cylinders.  This includes the chlorine cylinder repair kits, which are used to patch or plug holes in the cylinders we use.  We have procedures in place requiring two operator whenever changing cylinders, statistically the most dangerous time for leaks.  We also follow OSHA's process safety management program, which outlines procedures for every thing we do in relation to the chlorine.  We have chlorine leak detectors in place and operational which will give off an alarm if there is even a slight leak which cannot be detected by smell.  As a result of these measures we have not had an accidental release in the last five years.  Over and above all of this we have a coordinated emergency response program with the Pahokee Fire Department.  The fire department personal are trained in emergency responsed to these kinds of leaks.  We are also coordinated with the county fire department for emergency response.  We are planning more trainging for the future and as part of this program, all future work done on the chlorine equipment will be done by factory certified repairemen."
