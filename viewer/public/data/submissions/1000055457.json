There are currently seven full time employees working three shifts at the plant.  The water treatment plant has an operator on duty at all times day ot night, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year.\r\n\r\nThe water source for the Town of Greeneville is the Nolichuckey River.  The pump house that contains the pumps that are used to transport the raw water to the Greeneville Water Treatment Plant is located at mile 57.2 on the Nolichuckey River.  Water enters the pump house pumpwell through sluice gates located in the wall of the pump house.  The sluice gates are the means by which the amount of water entering the pumpwell is regulated.  After entering the sluice gates the water goes through a traveling bar screen where trash and debris are removed.  Once the raw water is in the pumpwell, copper sulfate penthydrate is fed into the water to control algae.  We are presently feeding approximately 14.3 pounds of copper sulfate penthydrate to treat one million gallons of raw water.\r\n\r\nThe pump house contains three pumps that are used to transport the raw water to the water treatment plant.  The pumping rates of these three pumps are, two at 10 million gallons per day (MGD), and one at 12 MGD.  After leaving the pump(s) the water travels to the raw water resevoir located at Greeneville's Water Treatment Plant through either a 20 inch in diameter or a 24 inch in diameter pipe.\r\n\r\nThe raw water resevoir at the water treatment plant is a large, man-made, pond type structure that holds approximately 32 million gallons of water.  In addition to being used for the presettling of solids out of the water, it is also an emergency backup water source.  This means that, if we were to be notified that the river had a contaminant in it, the water treatment plant could, in order to prevent any contaminated water from entering our system, shut of"

Water flows from the tower into a 24 inch line that allows the water to flow to the flash mix tanks.  In the flash mix tanks chlorine is added (approximately 200 lbs./8.2 MG of water) to prohibit bacteria growth, and polyaluminum chloride is added (approximately 115 lbs./MG of water) as a coagulant to help any solids in the water settle out at a faster rate.  The water then leaves the flash mix tanks by way of a 20 inch and a 30 inch pipe to the mixing basins.  In the mixing basins the chemicals, that were added in the flash mix tanks, are further mixed with the water by a baffling system.\r\n\r\nThe water then flows into the sedimentation basins where the polyaluminum chloride collests the dirt and sand and causes it to settle to the bottom.  These solids are flushed out of the sedimentation basins twice yearly and placed into one of two holding lagoons.  In the holding lagoons the solids are allowed to continue to settle.  Only one holding lagoon is used each year while the other is drained and the solids that have accumulated removed.  The water from the sedimentation basins flows over weirs into filters located inside the water treatment plant building.  These filters are designed to remove any sediment that did not settle out in the sedimentation basins.\r\n\r\nThere are ten filters in the water treatment building.  These filters contain anthracite coal, sand, filter gravel, and granulated activated carbon.  Each filter is designed to filter up to 2 million gallons of water daily.  Combined, this makes the total filtering ability of the water treatment plant approximately 20 MGD.\r\n\r\nOnce filtered, and as t"

In addition, approximately 6 pounds of fluoride is added per each million gallons of water to aid in the development of children's teeth, caustic soda is added for the adjustment of the water's pH at a rate of approximately 38 pounds per million gallons of water, and approximately 16 pounds of zinc orthophospate is added per million gallons of water to help prevent corrosion in the distribution system.  These clearwells are designed as holding tanks in order that the chlorine will have ample time to destroy bacteria which may be present in the water before allowing the water to enter the distribution system.\r\n\r\nFrom the clearwells, the finished water then enters into pumpwells.  Upon entering the pumpwells the water is considered safe for public consumption and is ready to enter the distribution system.  The water is pumped into the distribution system by using one, or any combination of, five different pumps that are located at the water treatment plant.  These pumps are rated as follows: two at 3 MGD, one at 6 MGD, one at 8 MGD, and one at 12 MGD.  These pumps, in addition to pumping water directly to the customers, pump water to storage tanks located in different areas of Greeneville.\r\n\r\nThese tanks, in addition to storage, are used to ensure that ample water pressure is provided to the customers and for fire protection.  The Greeneville Water Commission currently have seven water tanks with a combined storage capacity of 7 million gallons of water.  This represents a reserve of 7 million gallons that would be available, in the event of a main line break, to ensure that water service to the Greeneville area would not be interrupted.\r\n\r\nThere is instrumentation located at the water treatment plant to continuously monitor the water for pH levels, turbidity (clarity), chlorine residual, the flow"

This instrumentation is calibrated on a regular basis by authorized personnel to insure its accuracy.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important control measures to ensure that the water is being treated efficiently and effectively is the use of laboratory sampling.  Laboratory sampling is extensive, with laboratory tests being performed both on site at the water treatment plant and at qualified, state approved, private laboratories.  The operator on duty runs a turbidity (clarity) test on both the raw and finished water, a chlorine residual test on the sedimentation basin and the finished water, pH on the raw and finished water, and fluoride on the finished water every four hours, 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nLaboratory tests are also performed for the following parameters as well: trihalomethanes (Thm's) which are by-products of chlorination caused by chlorine mixing with organic compounds in the water, synthetic organic chemicals (SOC's) to check for any man-made chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides, volatile organic chemicals (VOC's) to check for any man-made chemicals such as paint thinners and fuel products, radionnuclides to check for any by-products of the nuclear industry, lead and copper, sodium, and asbestos.  The frequency of these tests are determined by the State of Tennessee, Department of Environment and Conservation.\r\n\r\nEach month we collect and analyze samples from 40 different locations throughout the water treatment plant's distribution system.  These samples are tested for chlorine residual, phosphate and total coliform.  Although the number of samples required to be caught each month in our distribution system is less, we continue to collect and analyze 40 each month to ensure the water quality throughout the entire distribution system.

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the Greeneville Water Commission Water Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Greeneville Water Commission Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one to"

The Greeneville Water Treatment Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan as required by the Environmental Protection Agency and is included in the written plans of the Town of Greeneville's Emergency Management Agency.  The personnel at the Water Treatment Plant are trained in the latest and most up-to-date procedures concerning chlorine safety and handling.  This training is updated annually to guarantee that all employees know the correct action(s) to take in any situation that might arise.\r\n\r\nThere has not been a major chlorine gas leak at the Greeneville Water Treatment Plant during the last five years.  Occasionally, when hooking up a full container of chlorine, a lead washer will not seal properly and when the operator turns the valve on to check for leaks a small amount of chlorine gas will escape.  The amount is so small that it will not trigger the alarm and will not leave the confines of the chlorine room.  When this happens the operator will immediately shut off the valve and replace the lead washer and then recheck for leaks.  When there is no leakage detected the container can be placed into service.\r\n\r\nThe response plan at the Greeneville Water Treatment Plant consists of the following components.
