The refinery processes foreign and domestic crude oil for the production of a range of fuel products such as liquid petroleum gases, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil. The facility also has the capability to process renewable feedstocks such as soybean oil, canola oil, corn oil, used cooking oil, and animal fats to produce renewable diesel. \n\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated, and it was determined that some of the facility's processes render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, some of the processes render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, the facility is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.  \n\nThe facility maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the facility identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, and are designed to further enhance the facility's existing safety programs and procedures.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nVertex Energy, Inc. views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emer"

The Mobile Site has 24-hour communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility's plan covers topics such as responding to a potential release, fire, explosion, or chemical release.   Procedures and practices related to the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment are also in place.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\nTypes of RMP site specific prevention steps include the following:\n-Release detection (e.g., process alarms, operator surveillance, fixed and portable hydrocarbon and toxic gas monitoring equipment);\n-Release containment and control (e.g.,relief systems, dikes to contain liquid releases, back-up equipment, control valves); and\n-Release Mitigation (e.g., area firewater monitors, emergency response equipment, trained emergency response personnel)."
