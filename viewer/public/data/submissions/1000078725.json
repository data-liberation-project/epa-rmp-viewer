General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps  \r\n\r\nThe Finney County, Kansas facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\r\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\r\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\r\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\r\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\r\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\r\nThe key concepts in Tyson's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  Tyson has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\r\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia systems.  Tyson employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\r\nTyson policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Tyson maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\r\nTyson is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety"

(Tyson) Finney County, Kansas facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.\r\nTyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Description\r\n\r\nTyson Fresh Meats operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Tyson operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, and tallow.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, cold storage, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\r\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Finney County, Kansas facility has three separate ammonia refrigeration systems: the Slaughter, Processing, and Trans Continental Cold Storage (TCCS) refrigeration systems.
