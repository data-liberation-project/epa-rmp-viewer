A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process. Unforeseeably, if a release is to occur, in order to provide the most effective means to control and mitigate the effects of an accidental release, Cloverhill Bakery has their own highly trained emergency response team. The response team is in complete coordination with response teams from the Chicago Fire Department and Chicago Hazardous Materials team as well as directors at local hospitals.  \n\nControlling accidents is and will continue to be a leading focus for the company and the individual employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nCloverhill Bakery is a relatively new facility operated as a wholesale bakery located in Chicago, IL.  The facility operates one ammonia refrigeration system used to cool ingredient and freeze product. Current anhydrous ammonia inventory consists of approximately 9,500 pounds.  On October 16, 2003 Cloverhill will receive an additional 3000 lbs of Ammonia.  Over the next year Cloverhill will expand the facility. Due to continued expansion, Cloverhill plans to increase the anhydrous ammonia inventory to up to 15,000 lbs over the next two years. With this in mind, Cloverhill will be ?predictive file? this amount and use this information when calculating both worst case and alternate scenarios. The system will be regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR1910.119) and subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA?s RM program.\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary o"

Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees have complete access to the program.  Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. \n\n* Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the systems.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If / Checklist Technique have been conducted to look at the systems and identify potential hazards. \n\n* Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n* Training:  A training program has been developed which insures that employees who directly work with the ammonia system or safety of the system are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation or safe response to the system.\n\n* Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration systems.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n* Pre-Start up Safety Review:  A pre-start up safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed a"
