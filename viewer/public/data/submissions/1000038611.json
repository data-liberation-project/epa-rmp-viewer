No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therfore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the informationsubmitted is true, accurate, and complete. \n\n            \n\n\n\n \n\n\\ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Burbank Gas Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Burbank Gas Plant located near Burbank, Oklahoma uses a refrigeration process to separate heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas.  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g. methane, ethane, "
