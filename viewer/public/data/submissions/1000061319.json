The Occidental Permian Ltd's Antelope Gas Cap is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, DUCRP personnel have been trained on the emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.  \n\n                                             \n\nB.
