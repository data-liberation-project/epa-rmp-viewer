Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 130,000 pounds between the main bullet and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst case scenario/ Alternative-case scenario\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and an alternative-case scenario, however it has been witheld from this executivve summary as a security sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1 , published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, Minnesota Dept. Ag rules. \n\n5. The five-year history\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program\nThe facility has:\n\nA. A written emergency action plan, in accordacne with OSHA Standar, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nB."
