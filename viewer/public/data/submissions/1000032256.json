This Risk Management Program as implemented will assist to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of chemical releases.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Dallas DWU implements a preventive maintenance program and inspection and testing program to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accident.\n\nThe Eastside WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident.  Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the City of Dallas Police and Fire Department and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Eastside WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Hazard Analysis as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.  Process safety information includes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia information and equipment information.\n\nThe City of Dallas Engineering Department verifies that all equipment used in the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes comply with applicable codes and standards and with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nThe Hazard Review (Process Hazard Analysis) completed for t"

      "SummaryText": "his Risk Management Plan (RMP) documents the process and the findings to minimize or eliminate hazards, to mitigate the consequences of hazards of any releases or other unplanned events, and to reduce the likelihood of exposure to chlorine or anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nWritten procedures and information have been developed, implemented, and maintained for hazardous processes, including steps for each operating phase and operating limits.\n\nAll employees involved in working with and around the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems are trained in process and safety procedures, including emergency response on an annual basis.\n\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs.  \n\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel.  \n\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up.  Each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in the workplace will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP.  \n\n The WTP chlorine and anhydrous ammonia system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years the Eastside WTP has had three accidental releases:\n\n?    10/11/2011 - An apprentice electrician was exposed to residual chlorine gas while working in the Chlorine Room.  The incident occurred while mechanics were connecting up a railcar and replacing an unloading hose to the chlorine feed system.  Additional training for operators was conducted in proper operation of unloading and loading equipment.\n\n?    6/23/2011 - Less than 1 pound of chlorine was release"

      "SummaryText": "d to the atmosphere due to a leak in the rupture disc in piping. One employee was sent to the hospital emergency room for evaluation; no injury was found. Rupture disks and fixed chlorine pressure alarms were checked and replaced in all components of the chlorine piping system.\n\n?    6/15/2009 - An employee was disassembling a component of the liquid ammonia system in the Evaporator Room of the Ammonia Building.  The component contained liquid ammonia and sprayed the employee in the face.  Employee's eyes were flushed and taken to local hospital, treated, and released.  Additional training was provided for employees who work in this area to follow proper procedures.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan for the WTP includes the following elements:\n\n?    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\n\n?    Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures \n\n?    Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance\n\n?    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance\n\n?    Training for all employees in relevant procedures\n\n?    Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes\n\nA copy of emergency procedures is maintained at the location for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia stationary sources (maintained at the facility). WTP personnel are trained to take action in the event of a release and will attempt to control a release within their capability.  In the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, they would immediately notify the Fire Department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Eastside WTP planned changes to improve safety include conducting additional chlorine/ammonia release drills with the Fire Depa"
