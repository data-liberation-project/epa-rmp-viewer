      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWe at Tate & Lyle-Decatur are strongly committed to employees, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of corn syrup, dry dextrose, industrial starch, and baking starches. We have two regulated substances at our facility, ethylene oxide and sulfur dioxide. Ethylene oxide is used in starch modification. Sulfur dioxide is utilized in the steeping step of the corn wet milling process.\n\nThe storage system for EO is designed to prevent overheating and contamination of EO. Specific additional measures for EO storage passive mitigation include a break tank and a sump in the secondary containment area. Specific measures for EO storage active mitigation include a one-million gallon disposal tank, a packed-column vapor scrubber, improved cooling of ethylene oxide transfer, enhanced process control and detection systems. Nitrogen continues to be utilized for the bulk storage tank, break tank, and railcar blanketing. The capability has been added to use nitrogen for maintenance purging.\n\nPASSIVE MITIGATION\nThe addition of a BREAK TANK creates a BREAK between the process and the bulk storage tank. Isolating the process from bulk storage will reduce the risk of contaminants getting into bulk storage. Contaminents could lead to unwanted reactions causing temperature rise, pressure rise, or increase in level.\n\nThe storage area incorporates a sloped diked area around railcar unloading and bulk storage, draining to a sump. The sump allows reclamation of any spilled materi"

      "SummaryText": "al or deluge water.\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION\nThe one-million gallon DISPOSAL TANK allows emptying and dilution of the EO in the bulk storage tank and the break tank. The tank is maintained at sufficient levels of water to allow dilution of the EO. There are also provisions to mix caustic with the EO to speed the conversion to ethylene glycol.\n\nVapor can be generated for maintenance activities requiring tank and/or pipe purging. Vapor can also result from venting of the bulk storage tank in the unlikely event that high pressures and high temperatures occur from contamination of the EO. The PACKED COLUMN vapor scrubber converts EO vapor into glycol liquid which can be safely handled in the facility pre-treatment plant.\n\nThe IMPROVED COOLING SYSTEM in the new storage compound maintains the temperature in the storage tank at 50-55 F. The cooling system includes a cooling jacket on the bulk storage tank and a heat exchanger on the transfer system.\n\nPROCESS CONTROLS have been utilized in the past to ensure the continuous monitoring of EO. \nThe Ethylene Oxide storage system has many layers of safety to prevent a release of ethylene oxide from the storage tank and associated system. All control interlocks are designed to shut down the system and bring it to a safe state for inspection and troubleshooting. There are EO ambient sensors placed around the new EO storage compound that are continuously monitored by the Central Control personnel. The EO storage tank has a mechanical excess flow valve on its discharge. The system also has an emergency air supply enabling system operation even in the event of a power outage.\n\nSulfur dioxide is an addition to the risk management plan. Normal processing operations do not require on-site storage of sulfur dioxide gas. The Decatur facility normally operates a molten sulfur burner to create the sulfur dioxide for the process on an as needed basis (what is made is immediately used) but there are times when the sulfur burner must be taken out of"

The tank truck storage capacity exceeds the sulfur dioxide threshold for inclusion in the Risk Management Program.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate scenarios we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Off-Site Consequences analysis and EPA's RMPComp*. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 38 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 standard, NFPA-36 standard, applicable ANSI and ASME standards, and considering chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary facility.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nTate & Lyle-Decatur maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What If Scenarios. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering maintenance, and process operations that are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the entire ethylene oxide storage tank/rail car unloading system was completed on 10/11/2007. The most recent PHA review for the sulfur dioxide system was completed on 11/15/2007.\n\nOPERATIN"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTRAINING\nTate & Lyle-Decatur has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nTate & Lyle-Decatur carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to insure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
