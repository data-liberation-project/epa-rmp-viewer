Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries. It is the policy of the Preferred Freezer Services, LLC (Preferred Freezer) facility located in Miami, Florida to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner. This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.\r\n\r\nPreferred Freezer implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through ongoing employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations. These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency\r\nAction Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nPreferred Freezer is located at 12855 NW 113th Court, in Miami, Florida. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas. The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and to IIAR guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of Preferred Freezer facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 11,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage.

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Preferred Freezer to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility. The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner. The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner. The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards. The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner. The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process. The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Preferred Freezer's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner. The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits. Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches ar"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will alarm at 50 ppm in the Engine Room, and 25 ppm in the dock, and freezer areas. When the detectors alarm, they terminate the supply of ammonia to the area of the warehouse in which the detection occurred. This prevents the quantity released from escalating. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the reportable quantity of 100 pounds within the last five years (August 2006 - August 2011). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat (cannot respond to ammonia concentrations exceeding 300 ppm), the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, and RMP regulations. Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuation procedures.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed on June 14 & 15, 2011, generated mitigation measures recommendations) to improve safety at the Preferred Freezer facility located in Miami, Florida.
