The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system on site to provide freezing and cooling capabilities.  This Risk Management Plan was developed for the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Quakertown facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM Rule).  The management system developed based on this regulation together with elements of the Risk Management Program results in a comprehensive prevention program.  USCS is committed to maintaining this system. \r\n\r\nThe elements of the prevention program include: an employee training program, written operating procedures, a maintenance program, a system to manage changes at the plant to ensure that safety and employee training issues are addressed, a hot work permit program, a program for ensuring that contractors are trained and informed of hazards, and a system to review new or modified sources before start-up to ensure safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Quakertown facility has had no accidents with significant on-s"

It is the policy of the facility management to implement the requirements of this ER Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations and general good operating practices.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire or an accidental hazardous material release.  The ERP and EAP was developed to ensure fast and efficient response in case of an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe ERP and EAP identifies the emergency response organization, the procedures for notification and  evacuation, and emergency preparedness and planning.\r\n\r\nUSCS has coordinated services with a number of government and community agencies which would respond to an emergency, such as the state and local police or fire departments, the ambulance squad, state and county emergency response officials, and an area hospital.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nUSCS is committed to maintaining a safe and efficient ammonia refrigeration system.  Part of this commitment is maintaining and operating the system in accordance with the principles and requirements of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP plans.  Several recommendations were made to improve safety at the facility during a recent PHA study, including the installation of new ammonia pumps."
