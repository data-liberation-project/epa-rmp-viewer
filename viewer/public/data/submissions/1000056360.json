The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": " training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nOne accident occurred on 4/30/2013. This was initiated by the wrong schedule of pipe \"nipple\" having been installed at a piece of equipment.  Due to the undersized wall thickness and vibration, the pipe eventually developed a crack at the threads.  The leak introduced a low level of ammonia to the compressor room.  While attempting to located and correct the leak, emergency officials arrived and required the evacuation of the compressor room as well as forced shutdown of the refrigeration system.  The shutdown of the refrigeration system allowed suction pressures to rise.  Although the overall header suction pressures did not approach any relief valve set point, the brine pumps for one heat exchanger (not stopped by the forced shutdown by emergency officials) continued to introduce heat to the heat exchanger.  This locally increased the pressure in the heat exchanger until relief valves lifted on the heat exchanger.  Because this heat exchanger wasn't in the vicinity of the compressor room, it took time for 1) the smell of ammonia from the relief valve lifting to be noticed by facility and emergency personnel and 2) for the actual source and direct cause to be identified.  As a result of the accident, no persons (inside or outside the facility) were injured.  Preventative steps to prevent recurrence included inspection of all other pipe nipples in similar applications as well as increased presence of ammonia refrigeration contractor personnel.\n\n\n\nTo prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY has implemented a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. T"

NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.

Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nNATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of NATURE'S PATH FOODS, INC - SUSSEX FACILITY employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\n\n\n"
