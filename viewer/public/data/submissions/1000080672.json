The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on backup support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous material"

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED COMPOUNDS HANDLED\n\n\n\nFresno Poultry is located at 2960 South Cherry Avenue in Fresno, California. The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses. The facility is approximately 1.5 miles west of Highway 99. The site is bordered by North Avenue to the south, a scrap metal/salvage yard to the north, Highway 41 to the west, and Cherry Avenue to the east.\n\n\n\nThe facility was constructed in 1986/1987 for Rockford Turkey Processing. Foster Farms purchased the plant in 1990. Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products. The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making. A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Fresno Poultry ammonia system is continuously monitored by au"

The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to a diffusion panel. Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels. Additionally, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\n\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\n?    Ammonia Detection System: \n\n?    Ammonia detection sensors are installed in all production areas that have ammonia equipment.\n\n?    Production area sensors shut off liquid ammonia to equipment upon activation.\n\n?    Ammonia detection sensors are installed in engine rooms.\n\n?    Ammonia detection sensors in engine rooms activate emergency ventilation system.\n\n?    Ammonia detection system provides audible and visual alarm signals.\n\n?    Emergency shutdown systems\n\n?    Component specific safety shutdowns\n\n?    Safeties are tested annually\n\n?    Pressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\n\n?    All major vessels are connected to a fire diffusion panel\n\n?    Many of the ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\n\n?    Pressure relief valves are replaced at least every 5 years\n\n?    A fire sprinkler system is installed in the plant\n\n?    A central computer system monitors the refrigeration system and alarms when safety set-points are exceeded\n\n?    Operators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\n\n\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigati"

Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\n\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a discussion of accidents involving a release of a reportable quantity (RQ) of ammonia that have occurred at the facility within 5 years prior to the request for submitting the RMP or that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within 5 years of the request for submitting the RMP.  Foster Farms knows of no reportable releases at the facility within the required reporting period.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFoster Farms has developed a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that identifies emergency personnel responsibilities, procedures, evacuation measures and reporting requirements.  The Foster Farms ERP is based on an emergency operations organization in which the Incident Commander serves as the chief officer in emergency situations.  The Incident Commander will take charge of the emergency response and response team and direc"

The ERP addresses ammonia specific issues as required by the RMP/PSM standards, including a determination of incidents that constitute an emergency.\n\n\n\nFoster Farms has developed the ERP to assure compliance with RMP/PSM requirements. The Plant Manager or designee will maintain the ERP.  Additionally, a copy of the ERP will be kept with the RMP/PSM documentation and at other appropriate locations. Refer to the ERP, for further information regarding emergency planning and response.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility have been ongoing. Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the recent process hazard analysis revalidation team have already been implemented. Others will be implemented during the next eighteen months. \n\n\n\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly. Foster Farms is scheduling completion of proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\n\n\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations.
