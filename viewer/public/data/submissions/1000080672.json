The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on backup support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous material"

The ERP addresses ammonia specific issues as required by the RMP/PSM standards, including a determination of incidents that constitute an emergency.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms has developed the ERP to assure compliance with RMP/PSM requirements. The Plant Manager or designee will maintain the ERP.  Additionally, a copy of the ERP will be kept with the RMP/PSM documentation and at other appropriate locations. Refer to the ERP, for further information regarding emergency planning and response.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility have been ongoing. Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the recent process hazard analysis revalidation team have already been implemented. Others will be implemented during the next eighteen months. \r\n\r\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly. Foster Farms is scheduling completion of proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations.

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED COMPOUNDS HANDLED\r\n\r\nFresno Poultry is located at 2960 South Cherry Avenue in Fresno, California. The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses. The facility is approximately 1.5 miles west of Highway 99. The site is bordered by North Avenue to the south, a scrap metal/salvage yard to the north, Highway 41 to the west, and Cherry Avenue to the east.\r\n\r\nThe facility was constructed in 1986/1987 for Rockford Turkey Processing. Foster Farms purchased the plant in 1990. Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products. The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making. A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Fresno Poultry ammonia system is continuously monitored by au"
