      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Poet Biorefining-Hanlontown, facility (formerly Iowa Ethanol) is located approximately 0.5 miles west northwest of Hanlontown (approximately 6 mile east of the Worth/Winnebago County line) along Iowa Highway 9.  Poet Biorefining-Hanlontown\u00c2\u00bfs main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in March 2004.  Poet Biorefining-Hanlontown produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 192,500 gallons (approximately 1,211,000 pounds), and potentially in Tank 802, which also has a capacity of 192,500 gallons.  NGC is blended with the ethanol via in-line blending, and the denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER EPA\u00c2\u00bfs CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical present at Poet Biorefining-Hanlontown which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC unloading platform, the NGC storage tanks, the in-line blending equipment, the denatured ethanol loadout platform, and the associated transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration range o"

The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the maximum capacity of the denaturant storage tanks (Tank Nos. 802 and 805), located in the center containment area of the tank farm.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY AND PROGRAM\nPoet Biorefining-Hanlontown is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  In the event of an emergency, Poet Biorefining-Hanlontown\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Hanlontown to notify the Hanlontown Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nPoet Biorefining-Hanlontown is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks ha"
