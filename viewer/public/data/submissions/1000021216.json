This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident protection, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CS-103 COMPRESSOR STATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe CS-103 compressor station, located approximately 30 miles south of Havre in Blaine County, Montana, operates a refrigeration system to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  The facility products include pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane) and natural gas liquids comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The process to represent all regulated flammable substances at the CS-103 compressor station which contain above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\nA? Product Tank comprised of C2+ mixture.\n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the CS-103 compressor station.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBecause the process at the CS-103 compressor station which is regulated by the EPA RMP rule is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, no additional steps for accidental release prevention are required.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the CS-103 compressor station that have occurred in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATON\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The overall emergency response program for the CS-103 compressor station is coordinated with the Blaine County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe CS-103 compressor station has had very safe operations over its brief history.  However, the facility continually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility.  Our company is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies and our facility personnel.  Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency responders is a integral part of our operations.\n"
