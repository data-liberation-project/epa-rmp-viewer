      "SummaryText": "LCY Elastomers LP owns and operates a facility at 4803 Decker Drive, Baytown, Texas which began operations in 1992 to manufacture synthetic rubber from a polymerization process utilizing styrene monomer and either 1,3-butadiene or isoprene in a cyclohexane solvent solution. This facility was previously owned by Enichem Elastomers Americas Inc., Enichem Americas Inc., and Polimeri Europa. The RMP regulated chemicals which are at this facility are 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, both flammable materials. There is a toxic material, dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) also at this location. It is below the regulated amount but LCY Elastomers LP has decided to include it. The process is a continuous batch reaction in which either a styrene and isoprene or a styrene butadiene co-block polymer is produced. After the rubber is formed, the solvent is steam stripped and the polymerized material is carried to the finishing and packaging section in a water slurry. After the rubber undergoes a drying and cooling process, it is packaged in boxes and/or bags. On site storage space is adequate for inventory and shipping of all product.\n\nLCY Elastomers LP has not had an accidental release since the plant began operation in 1992.\n\nAlong with the RMP regulations, LCY Elastomers LP is also regulated BY OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations. This regulation set into place many of the requirements that the RMP rule has. LCY Elastomers LP risk management program involves the use of state of the art process control systems and equipment in the safest working condition. Personnel are also trained on emergency response procedures for handling situations that could present a hazard to equipment or personnel within the facility or outside the boundaries of company property. Procedures are reviewed on an annual basis and personnel receive both on-site and off-site training to prepare for incidents that presents a hazard. LCY Elastomers LP has informed the Baytown community of the potential hazard"
