This facility manufactures juice concentrate processing consistent with NAICS 31193 for 12 months per year. Ventura Coastal LLC Visalia facility is a Program 3 with inventories greater than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. Since the last update changes have occured that increased inventory slightly, however not the largest process vessel. \n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Ventura Coastal LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We have a State-of-the-art refrigeration process with Diffusion tanks, Ammonia detection, emergency ventilation and alarm paging/notification. Our facility is fenced, has video surveillance and is monitored by a refrigeration control system continuously.\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass food manufacturing.  We have 1 regulated substance above threshold quantities present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) used for a refrigerant. We have inventories greater than 10,000 lbs. requiring compliance as Program 3 level.\n\n\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative control"

According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMPComp software.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest high-pressure receiver (vessel). In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the largest vessel at the maximum safe storage capacity.  In typical operation only 10-20% of this amount is present at one time in any receiver. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability, urban location due to trees/orchards in the area providing obstacles and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  \n\n\n\nPopulation estimates for the entire area is included in the study. Actual number affected by a worst case release is only 10% of this amount that would be in the plume footprint. The plume footprint is an oblong area starting at the release point getting the widest ? the distance to the toxic endpoint and then narrowing again.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a compressor shaft seal failure.  The scenario involves the release of 9 lb/min. of   toxic vapor being re"

No public receptors are in the distance to toxic endpoint. In this release it would just reach the property boundary. \n\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nVentura Coastal LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA was performed on 11/18/14. The previous PHA/update was performed in 2009. All possible conditions that could upset the system and natural disasters like fire and earthquake were considered.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Ventura Coastal LLC maintains written operating procedures.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency defensive actions including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCounty of Tulare is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Painting pipes, installing labels on all steam and other pipes when in the NH3 areas, repairing damaged and missing insulation, providing additional local alarm notification and performing Mechanical Integrity and a Seismic Review are some of the proposed recommendations being implemented. These changes are to be implemented in the next year."
