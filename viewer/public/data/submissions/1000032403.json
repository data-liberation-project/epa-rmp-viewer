      "SummaryText": "I.   Approach to Prevention of Accidental Releases\r\n\r\nSt. Jude Medical, Inc. - Woodridge Technology Center (SJM) has adopted a comprehensive, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  SJM has incorporated applicable codes related to engineering and safe handling of hazardous materials, continuous training of operators and support staff, and best safety management practices.  SJM has a comprehensive emergency response plan which includes onsite emergency coordinators and coordination with the local fire department.   \r\n\r\nSJM qualifies for Program 3 requirements for use of methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) under the EPA Risk Management Program.  This material is used in the manufacture of mechanical heart valves.  SJM has previously implemented a process safety management program to prevent unplanned releases of  MTCS.  The SJM Risk Management Plan (RMP) refers to the process safety management plan for information on process hazards and prevention related to MTCS. \r\n\r\nII.  Sources and Hazardous Materials \r\n\r\nSJM has one process which qualifies for EPA Risk Management Program requirements.  The SJM coating process uses MTCS, which is a toxic and flammable liquid, and is contained in DOT specification containers of 1,000 pounds each during storage and use.  \r\n\r\nIII.  SJM Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nSince SJM has already qualified for the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements for MTCS, it has already established a process safety program for the coating process.  Key elements include: hardware and controls installed according to required codes and best engineering practices, gas monitoring system, process gas scrubber system, process hazard analysis completed for the coating process, and updates have been completed for any changes in the process, written operator procedures and annual training for each facet of the coating process according to FDA requirements, comprehensive preventive maintenance program for all process a"

Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo accidental releases of MTCS have occurred within the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nV.  Emergency Response Procedures\r\n\r\nSJM has developed emergency procedures which is available to all employees.  The procedures cover response to chemical spills, fires, and medical emergencies.  Employees receive annual training in emergency response and evacuation procedures including recognition of gas system alarms and appropriate response.  The Little Canada Fire Department has reviewed these emergency procedures.  SJM has onsite Emergency Coordinators who are trained to assess response situations and initiate response procedures such as shutoff of emergency systems and summoning of outside emergency responders.  These personnel carry cell phones during the workday and after scheduled work hours.    \r\n\r\nVI.  Planned Safety Improvements\r\n\r\nA process hazard analyses was originally completed in October 1997 for the bulk gas system featuring MTCS.  It was reviewed again in February 2003 and July 2010.  All recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as determined necessary.  SJM continues to train employees in chemical safety and emergency response procedures annually."
