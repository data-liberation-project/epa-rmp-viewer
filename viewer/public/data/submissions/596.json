Chlorine is stored in the plant and used in one ton cylinders 24 hours a day and seven days a week.  Chlorine is the only chemical that Morganton uses in the threshold quantities as pertains to 40 CFR Part 68.130 Table 1.  Likewise chlorine is the only chemical that met OSHA's requirements for process safety management.  This document is intended to satisfy all requirements for the Risk Management Plan Clean Air Act 112(r).\n     Morganton has adopted emergency response plans as well as process safety management program has been recently reviewed and revised to handle emergency situations.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n     Chlorine is the only regulated chemical on the plant grounds, two ton cylinders are used at one time.  \nStorage of cylinders includes includes at any one time ten full cylinders.  Maximum storage on site would be 20,000 pounds of liquid chlorine.\n\nWorst case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n     Worst case scenario is a situation where a full cylinder ruptures due to tank failure, or corrosions etc.\nAlternative leak is to have valve leak.  Sensors located in the chlorine feed area are stationed to alert personnel to respond to this situation.  Most frequent problem would be with the valve working incorrectly and plant personnel responding to fix this minor leak.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n     Morganton recently revised their process safety management program to enhance safety with the chlorine feed facility.\n\nThe five year accident history\n     There was no accident in the last five"
