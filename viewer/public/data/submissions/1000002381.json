It was purchased by Appleton in 1984.  The employees of Appleton purchased the company from our European owners in 2001.  We at the West Carrollton Mill are proud to be part of a company that creates product solutions through its development and use of coating formulations and applications and encapsulation technology. We operate in four business segments: coated solutions, technical products, security products, and performance packaging.\n\nOur 430 member workforce is made up of employees in production, maintenance, engineering, technical, clerical and management roles.  Many of our employees have been with the company or employed at this location for 25 years or more.  In many cases, multiple members of the same families earn their living here, parents and children, siblings, cousins, aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews.  Most live within a few miles of the mill and are raising their families in West Carrollton and neighboring communities.  \n\nSafety, of our employees and of the community is a high priority at Appleton and at the West Carrollton Mill.  We recognize that every person is irreplaceable and that injury or loss of life is devastating to whole families.  We recognize the responsibility to our employees and the community that goes along with using hazardous chemicals.\n\nWe have eliminated the use of pure ammonia as a nutrient in our wastewater treatment process replacing it with a less hazardous, liquid product.  We have reduced the amount of propane stored on site to power forklifts and changed our storage method from a large tank to small cylinders. We have minimized the use of chlorine, for example, by eliminating the use of chlorine for the treatment of our process water and reducing the volume stored in railcars by one third.  Its only remaining use at the West Carrollton Mill is for the bleaching of recy"

Chlorine is used at the West Carrollton Mill to bleach the pulp from the recycled paper so it can be made into paper that meets the requirements of our customers.\n\nThere are three primary components of our Risk Management Plan.  Following is an overview of how we are effectively protecting the safety of our employees and the community through:\n  Hazard Assessments\n  Accident Prevention\n  Emergency Response Planning\n\nHazard Assessment\nIn addition to identifying and planning to prevent a worst case or alternative release scenario, we periodically examine every part of the process that contains chlorine.  Each piece of equipment, every pipe, every fitting, every valve, every control loop is analyzed to identify what might go wrong and how to prevent it.  For each situation identified, we plan a solution to eliminate that potential cause of a release.  The solutions are carried out as quickly as possible and their progress is tracked until all are complete.  Following are some of the precautions and procedures in place to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAccident Prevention\nWhile preparation for response to a release is important, our primary goal is to prevent one from ever happening.  Our prevention program, in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Planning regulations, ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used and handled.  The West Carrollton Mill accident prevention program consists of the following elements.\n     Process Safety Information:  We have compiled information to assist our employees who operate the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process.  This information comes from Material Safety Data Sheets and our chlorine and equipment suppliers.\n     Process Hazard Analysis:  A hazard evaluation has been performed by"

Using what-if scenarios and checklists, the team periodically evaluates the entire process for hazards.  In addition, the team reviews all incidents that occurred since their last review for their potential to result in a release.  They review engineering controls for situations that could result in failure and administrative controls and operating procedures for potential consequences of deviations from them.  \n     Operating Procedures:  Written procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities and operating all parts of the process consistent with the process safety information and hazard analysis.  Operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the process.  New employees are carefully trained by experienced employees and their supervisor.\n     Training:  Initial and refresher training is conducted as appropriate for each employee involved in operating a process.  Management ascertains and documents that each employee has received and understood the training.\n     Mechanical Integrity:  The West Carrollton Mill has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity program that applies to tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps in the covered process.  Written procedures, training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, correction of equipment deficiencies and quality assurance are all included in this program.\n     Management of Change:  Written procedures have been established and implemented to assure that changes made to the process will have no adverse impact on safety.  This process is a HAZOP analysis that looks at all possible impacts of the change.  Any proposed change that increases the likelihood of a release wonA\u00c2\u00bft be made.

This Risk Management Plan will also be updated if a change results in a change in the information it contains.\n     Pre-Startup Review:  A pre-startup safety review is performed whenever the process is modified significantly.  This review confirms, prior to startup, that construction and equipment is in accordance with the design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; if needed, a process hazard analysis has been performed; management of change requirements have been met and training of each affected employee has been completed.\n     Compliance Audits:  The West Carrollton Mill evaluates compliance with the provisions of PSM and will evaluate compliance with RMP at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the standards are adequate and are being followed.  The compliance audit is conducted by an internal auditor.  A report of any deficiencies found during the audit is prepared by the auditor.  Corrective action plans are documented by the West Carrollton Mill and include an expected completion date.  Progress toward completion is documented as well.\n     Incident Investigation:  The West Carrollton Mill will investigate each incident that results in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine.  As for an audit, a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation.  Intended corrective actions and expected completion dates are documented.  Progress reports are written.  The incident report and corrective actions are reviewed with affected employees.

The permit documents that fire prevention and protection procedures have been followed prior to beginning the hot work.  The permit also indicates the date(s) authorized for the work and identifies the object upon which the work is to be done.  \n     Contractors:  Contractors need special training to work safely on our chlorine process equipment.  We work closely with the owners of the contracted company, the supervisors of the contracted employees and the employees themselves to ensure that they are well trained and qualified to work on the chlorine using process safely.\n\nEmergency Response\nIn-house emergency response consists of training and planning for response to and recovery from emergencies.  Emergencies for which we have planned responses include not only chemical release, but also fire, explosion, floods and severe weather, including tornadoes.\n\nThese plans begin with internal warning alarms, a chain of command and specific responsibilities for key employees.   An emergency response team known as the Mill Emergency Organization responds to fires and chemical spills (except chlorine), provides first aid and coordinates evacuation of the mill if necessary including during a chlorine emergency.  A second team consisting of the employees who work with chlorine and know the processes the best is known as the Chlorine Response Team.  They have the equipment and training to respond to, isolate and repair minor leaks in the chlorine system.
