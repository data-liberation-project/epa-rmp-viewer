Several hundred feet of vacant lot owned by ER Carpenter LP behind the south side of the plant.\n\nThe Temple Division manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in furniture carpet cushion underlay, bedding and other applications.  The manufacturing process incorporates the use of TDI (toluene diisocyanate) as a reactant to produce the foam product.  TDI is received by railcar consisting of approximately 185,000 pounds of TDI, and is stored in several indoor storage tanks within the facility.  The largest of which holds approximately 12,200 gallons.  All TDI tanks are located inside the plant within concrete containments.  The TDI is pumped to the mixing head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a continuous slab of flexible polyurethane foam.  The foam is cut into 50 and 100-foot slabs, and then is stacked in the slab room to cure.\n\n3.\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\nTDI:  Assessment and modeling was conducted for a worse case release of TDI from the Temple Division.  The worst case was assumed to be the immediate release of approximately 185,000 pounds of TDI from a railcar at 113\u00c2\u00bfaF, onto the rail dock unloading area, which is located inside the facility.  This temperature was chosen since during the hottest day on record is 109\u00c2\u00bfaF, and in the winter months TDI must be heated to prevent freezing and stratification of the isomers.   TDI has a high boiling point and a low vapor pressure.  This will result in a neutrally buoyant plume close to the density of air.  The EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document also indicates that TDI will have a neutrally buoyant plume.\n\nModeling based on the release of 185,000 pounds of TDI @ 113\u00c2\u00bfaF onto an area of 4,536 s"

      "SummaryText": "ER Carpenter LP, Temple Pouring Plant was initially built in 1966 to produce prime flexible polyurethane foam for the furniture industry.  The prime line has been expanded and modified several times over the years in order to improve the process, with respect to both equipment and chemistry, to conform to new state and federal regulations while meeting the ever increasing and changing demands of the customers.  New product lines added over the years include bonded carpet underlay made from flexible foam trim and recycled foam, bonded polyester fiber batting, and a quilting line.\n\nOne RMP-regulated substances is used at this facility.  The prime pouring line uses TDI (2-4 toluene and 2-6 toluene diisocyanate), and the rebond process uses TDI blended with polyol to make a binder to bond the particles together.  No other RMP-regulated substances are used at this facility.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nER Carpenter LP, Temple Division, is committed to comply fully with all federal, state, and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental releases of chemicals, toxic or otherwise.  Furthermore, ER Carpenter LP is committed to protecting the health and welfare of its employees, the community residents, and the environment.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120) and both state and local regulations.  The Contingency Plan for the Temple Division includes procedures for proper notification of the local fire department, the police department, and the local hospital, when and if such notification becomes necessary.\n\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Temple Division currently occupies over 532,913 square feet, and is located at 2611 North General Bruce Drive, Temple, TX, 76501.

This would place the toxic endpoint beyond the fence line on the other side of the rail tracks, and include some of the residential area.  The population within this endpoint is estimated to be approximately 350 people.\n\n4.\tAlternative Release Scenario\n\nTDI:  The alternative case for a TDI spill is the rupture of a hole or leaking connection of a TDI unloading hose releasing for 30 minutes onto an area of 4,536 square feet located inside the facility.  The impact radius of this scenario is  0.1 miles.  This distance does extend into the residential area with a population estimate of 100 people.\n\n5.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable State of Texas codes and regulations required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Personnel training with air packs and practice drills for emergencies and spill response are an important part of our safety and preventive measures.\n\n6.\tFive Year Accident Histories\n\nThere have been no reportable spills within the last 5 years.\n\n7.\tThe Emergency Response Program\n\nThis program is referred to as the Emergency (Integrated Contingency) Plan for the Temple Division.  It is reviewed and revised on a yearly basis, unless immediate changes are needed as a result of equipment or personnel changes.  It includes a listing of the trained Spill Response Team and Fire Emergency Action Team.  The teams are trained to respond to an emergency spill or fire when the alarm is sounded, or incident is noticed.  Information with regards to the hazardous chemicals on site has been given to the local fire department, police department, and hospitals.\n\n8.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEmployees are regularly scheduled for Hazardous Materials Handling training as well as spill drills.
