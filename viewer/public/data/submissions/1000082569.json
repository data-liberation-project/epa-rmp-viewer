Disinfection involves addition of chlorine and aqueous ammonia to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may cause harm to public health.  Other chemicals are handled and safely used onsite to aid filtering and removal of organics and other particulate materials that may affect the taste and odor of the treated water.  These chemicals are not part of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, but are handled, stored, and used in a safe manner by Randall-Bold WTP staff.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine disinfection process at the Randall-Bold WTP is subject to two regulations: the Federal Risk Management Plan and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), which is California's version of the RMP.  The initial compliance deadline for both of these regulations was June 21, 1999.  As required by the regulations, an RMP was prepared for the Randall-Bold WTP and submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Contra Costa Health Services Department (CCHSD) at that time.\n\n   \n\nRMP/CalARP regulations require that the RMP be resubmitted every 5 years.  Based on the last RMP submission date of September 18, 2014 the 5-year RMP resubmission requirement must again be met by September 18, 2019.  The purpose of this RMP is to comply with the 5-year resubmission requirement.\n\n\n\nPrior to RMP/CalARP requirements, the Randall-Bold WTP implemented programs to comply with several other accidental release prevention regulations that predated RMP/CalARP.  These earlier regulations included California's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and California's Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) because of use and storage of chlorine. The California RMPP law was repea"

To meet this goal, CCWD has identified potential hazards, implemented comprehensive accident prevention programs, installed safety and release response equipment (including a scrubber system to treat release events and other process and piping related safety equipment), and prepared for emergencies. The CCWD's approach to meet safety information and associated operating and maintenance procedures and documentation requirements for RMP/CalARP is to build upon the existing programs and regulatory compliance activities associated with the PSM and RMPP Programs. The PSM and RMPP were implemented at Randall-Bold WTP when regulations became effective at the facility.  Most of the compliance requirements, documentation, procedures, and safety programs to meet compliance with these new regulations were taken directly from PSM and RMPP documents or existing operating and maintenance procedures. \n\n\n\nIt should be noted that this RMP is specific to the chlorine process at Randall-Bold WTP.  Randall-Bold WTP aqueous ammonia is below the Federal RMP threshold concentration limit of 20 percent by weight.  However, there is no aqueous ammonia threshold concentration limit for the State of California.  As such, all aqueous ammonia use in California exceeds the State's threshold concentration limit and may be subject to RMP requirements depending on storage amount.  Aqueous ammonia use at Randall-Bold WTP is presented in an addendum RMP under agreement with CCCHSD.  For the purposes of this submittal, the Aqueous Ammonia Process Executive Summary is presented at the conclusion of this Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nChlorine Safety Policy\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment.

The Randall-Bold WTP uses chlorine to disinfect water so that it is safe for customers to drink. Chlorine disinfection is a common process at water treatment plants. The Randall-Bold WTP disinfection system uses liquefied chlorine gas from four 1-ton containers. Up to twelve more 1-ton containers are kept in the chlorine storage room. A vacuum is used to draw chlorine out of the containers and into the water supply.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine storage and use areas are all inside a building that is designed to vent to a scrubber in the event of a chlorine release. The scrubber system can remove up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas released inside the building. The areas where chlorine is stored or used are equipped with chlorine sensors that alarm in the event of a chlorine leak. The Randall-Bold WTP is operated and maintained 24-hours a day by highly trained and experienced staff who are experts in the safe handling of chlorine and are prepared to respond to most release situations. Plant access is controlled so that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the chlorine building. Trained plant staff must accompany visitors.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nCCWD is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.

Such procedures benefit the release prevention program by providing operating personnel with clear and concise guidance to prevent and/or respond to an accidental release.  CCWD has developed a written operating procedures program, which satisfies the requirements of Section 2755.3 of the CalARP regulation, to ensure that written procedures and practices were developed, reviewed, implemented, and reflective of current plant practice.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures were originally developed in hard copy format as part of the construction contract for the completion of Randall-Bold WTP.  Revisions to the plan have been made over time, the procedures for which are described later in this section.  All operating procedures have been recently been converted to computer format.

Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff, added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures, and incorporated into existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Randall-Bold WTP that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Any small, incidental releases are quickly handled or neutralized to prevent off-site impacts and safety or health problems for on-site workers and the community.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCCWD has implemented its Emergency Response Program as well as installed safety systems on its chlorine process such as leak detection equipment and a scrubber to prevent and mitigate chlorine releases. The goal of the emergency response program is to protect its employees and the public in the unlikely event of a release. The two major elements of the emergency response program are an emergency action plan and notification procedures, both of which are described in CCWD's Emergency Response and Evacuation Plan/Employee Training.

The treatment process involves the use of certain chemicals to disinfect the water including chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  Chlorine and aqueous ammonia are used to form chloramines.  Chloramines provide the necessary residual chlorine in the treated water distribution system to ensure the general public receives safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nChlorine quantities at Randall-Bold WTP exceed the State and federal thresholds of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP).  Chlorine is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  \n\n\n\nRandall-Bold WTP aqueous ammonia, at 19 percent concentration by weight, only exceeds the State threshold.  The State threshold has no concentration limit.  As such, after consultation with Contra Costa Health Services Department (CCHSD) and based on findings of the worst-case scenario, aqueous ammonia is subject to CalARP Program 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to comply with the 5-year resubmission requirement based on the anniversary date of September 18, 2019.

Under agreement with CCHSD this RMP is prepared as an addendum to the existing Randall-Bold WTP Chlorine RMP.  A copy of the letter documenting this agreement is found in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe original Randall-Bold WTP Chlorine RMP was submitted to CCHSD in June 1999.  In accordance with CalARP Regulation, the Randall-Bold WTP Chlorine RMP has been resubmitted twice since the original submittal to satisfy the 5-year resubmission requirement.  The most recent Chlorine RMP resubmission is dated June 2016. \n\n\n\n\n\nA.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\n\n\nAs a public drinking water utility, CCWD recognizes the importance of protecting the general public.  CCWD operates Randall-Bold WTP in a manner that provides the public with a safe reliable source of drinking water.  Operation of Randall-Bold WTP not only consists of the proper treatment to ensure compliance with stringent drinking water standards, but the proper handling of hazardous materials to protect the public and our employees from an accidental release and to respond to an emergency.  The proper handling of hazardous materials is accomplished through the use and practice of the CCWD mission statement, policies, plans and programs at Randall-Bold WTP.  \n\n\n\nSome of these CCWD policies, plans and programs include specific provisions to comply with the CalARP regulation.  For example, the CCWD Environmental Compliance Plan dedicates a section to CalARP and compliance with the respective requirements.  As another example, the CCWD Safety and Health Manual devotes an entire section on Process Safety Management (PSM).  This PSM section lists requirements (e.g., Employee Participation, Process Hazard Information, Mechanical Integrity, etc.) and CCWD procedures to comply with these requirements accordingly.  Th"

The tank is located in a concrete walled chemical storage area.  The chemical storage area gradually slopes to a secondary containment basin.  This slope and drainage serve to collect and contain liquid spills from the tank.\n\n\n\nFor operational purposes, the storage volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The tank is equipped with various devices to relieve vacuum and prevent over pressurization, and control emissions during bulk loading and operation.  These devices include a pressure vacuum relief valve, vapor scrubber, and vapor return line.  In the event of excess pressure, ammonia vapors from the tank vent through the pressure relief valve to the vapor scrubber.  During bulk loading, vapors are returned to the delivery tanker truck by way of a vapor return line.\n\n\n\nThe primary use and purpose of aqueous ammonia is to form chloramines to maintain chlorine residual.  Chloramines prevent the formation of trihalomethanes in the treated water distribution system.  To form these chloramines, the chemical feed room pumps draw aqueous ammonia from the bulk storage tank.  From the chemical feed room, aqueous ammonia is piped to one or both of two injectors.  The primary injector feeds the aqueous ammonia at a point in the water treatment process located before the post ozone contactor.  The aqueous ammonia mixes ultimately with a chlorine solution.

An EPA approved dispersion model (RMP*CompTM) was used to evaluate the WCS and ARS.   RMP*CompTM is readily available to the public through EPA.\n\n\n\nFollowing are the results of the offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nC.1    Worst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nUnder the guidelines, a WCS considers a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the single largest container over a ten-minute period.  Given these parameters, the single largest container at Randall-Bold WTP is the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 6,000 gallons.  By CCWD administrative procedure the tank volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons.\n\n\n\nFor the Randall-Bold WTP WCS, the model input used passive mitigation.  This mitigation consisted of the containment of a spill in both the chemical storage area (area) and spill containment basin (basin).  For modeling purposes it was assumed that both the area and basin flooded simultaneously.  The depth of the modeled basin was set at the maximum height of the basin.  These are extremely conservative assumptions as they present the maximum amount of spill surface area exposure.\n\n\n\nThe model input also consisted of conservative input (e.g., rural conditions, stability class F, and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second) in accordance with the guidelines.  Additionally, an aqueous ammonia concentration of 20 percent was used to estimate distance to toxic end point.  This concentration is a set value in RMP*CompTM.  It slightly overestimates the actual concentration to yield conservative results.\n\n\n\nGiven the aqueous ammonia toxic endpoint (TE) of 0.14 milligrams per liter (CalARP Section 2770.5), the WCS distance to TE is 0.5 miles.

Using RMP*CompTM, the estimated release rate is 331 pounds per minute (about 41.4 gallons per minute).\n\n\n\nDefault values found in RMP*Comp (e.g., stability class D, and wind speed 3 meters per second) were used to calculate the ARS distance to TE.  Additionally, the ARS assumed a 20 percent aqueous ammonia concentration to utilize data readily available in RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nGiven the aqueous ammonia TE of 0.14 milligrams per liter (CalARP Section 2770.5), the ARS distance to TE is 0.2 miles.  Using census data, the estimated population within the ARS circle is 32.

Competency is verified in several ways: through written and oral examinations, demonstrations, and on-the-job training. Documentation of training is maintained on file at Randall-Bold WTP.  The files include job dimension documents and certification letters for all employees involved in operating the aqueous ammonia process prior to June 1999.\n\n\n\nRefresher training on specific operating procedures (e.g., normal operations, startup, shut down), safe work practices (e.g., limiting contractor access, lockout/tagout), and company-wide practices is conducted during monthly safety meetings, special training classes, and drills. The current schedule was developed with employee consultation and requires that refresher training be conducted every three years at a minimum. Training documentation (e.g., meeting minutes, attendees, instructor qualifications, refresher content, and means used to verify competency) is maintained on file at Randall-Bold WTP.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining may also be required as a result of a revised operating procedure, MOC, or Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that the Plant Operators receive training for revised operating procedures, and the required training specified in the MOC is conducted prior to implementation of the change. This MOC training satisfies the MOC program requirements of Section 2760.6 of the CalARP regulation. Training records would be attached to the completed MOC or PSSR documentation.  These records and documentation would be maintained on file at Randall-Bold WTP.\n\n\n\nThe CCWD Safet"

This matrix and its' accompanying timetable are used to ensure that each employee remains current with training requirements and is qualified to safely perform their job.  These records would be maintained at the District Center Human Resources Department.\n\n\n\nD.3.e    Maintenance\n\n\n\nA well-established maintenance program ensures that equipment critical to process safety is fabricated to meet process specifications, installed correctly, and maintained in a safe operating condition. This program allows maintenance employees to preemptively identify and correct equipment deficiencies to avoid an accidental release.  It directly benefits the accidental release program by establishing a program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained to prevent equipment failure that may result in an accidental release.  CCWD has developed a maintenance program that satisfies the requirements of Section 2755.5 of the CalARP regulation. CCWDA?s maintenance program applies to the storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent-systems, controls and pumps and additional equipment deemed to be important to safety by operating and maintenance personnel.  It is based on recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\nCCWD compiles all maintenance information (e.g., preventive maintenance documentation, quality assurance, the work order system, inspection and tests) for the Randall-Bold WTP on a computerized system (system). This system allows preventive maintenance procedures and inspection and test procedures to be automatically distributed.  A record of all equipment inspection results and identification of any equipment that does not meet the safe operating limits is maintained in the system, which is used to develop and disseminate maintenance reports for delinquent preventive maintenance, work orders, and test and inspections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe syst"

Revisions would be made if necessary and employees informed accordingly.  Additionally, maintenance updates would occur for any process modifications as a result of MOC.  The MOC procedure is found in Section 12 of the CCWD Process Safety Management Manual.\n\n\n\nAn important element of the maintenance program is proper training.  CCWD maintenance employees are trained to recognize and respond to unsafe working conditions under HAZWOPER training.  Additional safety training, such that employee's can recognize and correct unsafe working conditions related to their job tasks, is provided through routine safety tailgate meetings.  The CCWD Injury and Illness Prevention Program also provides a means to educate CCWD employees on safe working conditions, as well as report out and correct those that are unsafe.  For any contractor who performs maintenance work at Randall-Bold WTP, it is that contractor's responsibility to ensure that their employees are properly trained.\n\n\n\nD.3.f    Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nCCWD believes that ensuring that the prevention program elements are functioning properly (i.e., that they are complete, current, and applied in compliance with company policy, regulations, and good process safety practices) is vital to the continuous improvement of the accidental release prevention program. To this end, CCWD personnel perform internal compliance audits to review and evaluate the written documentation/records and implementation of the prevention program at least every three years. Potential areas for improvement within the prevention program elements are identified during the audit and recommendations are formulated to ensure an effective and improved overall prevention program. Implementation of audit recommendations is verified in subsequent audits.  The CCWD compliance audit procedures described above directly ben"

A compliance audit of the Chlorine System was conducted in February 2019, by Mr. Aaron Zude, CSP on behalf of Harris & Lee Environmental Sciences.  On December 11 and 12, 2018, Kristen Smith, CSP, CHMM, Environmental, Health & Safety Consultant from Harris & Lee Environmental Sciences conducted a three year compliance audit for the aqueous ammonia system.\n\n\n\nD.3.g    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nCCWD has developed and implemented an incident investigation procedure to investigate each incident which results in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a release of aqueous ammonia causing personnel injury or major property damage. This procedure establishes the means to investigate root cause, and develop and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or similar incidents.  Doing so directly benefits the release prevention program through a systematic investigative process designed to prevent recurrence.  The program satisfies the requirements of Section 2755.7 of the CalARP regulation. A description of the Incident Investigation procedure is provided in the CCWD Process Safety Management Manual\n\n\n\nE.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nCalARP requires the compilation of the five-year accident history for all accidental releases from the applicable process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  From the date of this RMP, there have been no accidental releases of aqueous ammonia at Randall-Bold WTP over the past five years.\n\n\n\nF."

      "SummaryText": "    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nRandall-Bold WTP is committed to the safe and quick response of aqueous ammonia accidental releases.  In the event of an accidental release, procedures are in place to safely evacuate the facility and notify agencies.  These procedures are described in detail in Section 2 of the CCWD Health & Safety Manual (Reference: Section 2 - Emergency Preparedness and Evacuation Procedures).  A copy of this manual is readily available at Randall-Bold WTP.\n\n\n\nSpecific spill response procedures are described in the Spill and Release Response Plan (plan).  This plan, which is found in the Randall-Bold WTP Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP), establishes response and notification procedures and responsibilities for spills and releases of hazardous materials including aqueous ammonia.  The plan is reviewed and revised if necessary as part of the annual HMBP renewal and submission process to CCHSD.  Outside resources would be requested to respond to an aqueous ammonia accidental release.  These outside resources include licensed hazardous waste contractors, the Oakley Fire Protection District (OFPRD), and CCHSD.  OFPRD and CCHSD are invited annually to participate in emergency response drills. \n\n\n\nG.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCCWD is committed to improve aqueous ammonia handling and process safety at Randall-Bold WTP.  Routine safety meetings, routine and regularly scheduled aqueous ammonia process maintenance activities, incident investigations, periodic review of the aqueous ammonia process, and external agency audits all serve as a means to identify areas of safety improvement.\n\n\n\nOur planned changes to improve safety are identified as action items in the following reports:\n\n\n\n?
