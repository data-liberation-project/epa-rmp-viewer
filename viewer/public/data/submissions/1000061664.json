Hydrogen is stored onsite in liquid form and vaporized for use in the argon purification process.  Gaseous hydrogen is also supplied as a product to our customer, Steel Dynamics, Inc., for use in steel making.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled and delivered by our facility, exceeds the threshold quantity set by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture industrial gases and to supply our customer with oxygen, argon, nitrogen and hydrogen gas.  The hydrogen is "

      "SummaryText": "supplied from a liquid hydrogen storage system consisting of a 20,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank and a bank of ambient air vaporizers.  The liquid hydrogen is stored and delivered to our site by tank truck, and the gaseous hydrogen is delivered to our customer by pipeline. We may also have up to 3 liquid hydrogen tankers at 13,000 gallons each stored at the site.\n\n\n\nThe regulated process at this facility is the liquid hydrogen storage system and associated gaseous hydrogen piping. \n\n\n\nHydrogen is the only  regulated substance handled at this facility in an amount exceeding the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed  and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThe liquid hydrogen tank was installed in April, 1997.  In the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of, flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from Butler Fire Department and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Butler Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n  \n\n6."
