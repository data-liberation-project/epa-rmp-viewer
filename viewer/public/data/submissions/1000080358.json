Included in these types of products are items such as spray paints, automobile maintenance products, household products, and industrial and institutional products.  The overall production process is a highly integrated operation involving management of incoming chemical and non-chemical raw materials; compounding, blending, mixing and storage of the chemical raw materials into packageable forms; packaging of these compounded materials into aerosol containers; and the temporary accumulation of these packages in warehousing areas prior to shipment.\n\n\n\nOur physical plant site consists of two buildings located on approximately 8.5 acres.  The main building, located centrally within the property, contains office, laboratory, warehousing, production, maintenance, and shipping and receiving areas.  The other building, designated Building 6, contains laboratory, warehousing, production, and shipping and receiving areas.  The plant site also has a propellant storage tank farm that contains 20 tanks; three underground storage tank fields containing 45 tanks; one aboveground storage tank area containing one tank; two tank truck off-loading areas; and a propellant off-loading area.  It is the propellant storage tank farm and the related process of packaging aerosol cans that is the subject of this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe tanks in the propellant storage tank farm store propane, isobutane, various blends of these two materials and difluoroethane. \n\n\n\n\n\nAPPROACH TO SAFETY\n\n\n\nAt Chicago Aerosol, we are committed to performing all operations, both chemical and non-chemical, in ways that are as safe as possible.  We know that many of the raw materials we use are hazardous and that proper operating procedures and employee training programs will minimize the risks associated with those hazards.  We have establis"

We maintain an open dialogue with the local fire departments, in addition to an open door policy, that encourages cooperation and guidance.  To prevent unintended access by third parties, we do restrict access to the facility to employees, authorized contractors and authorized visitors.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs described earlier, we are committed to operating our plant safely.  In order to acomplish this, we have reviewed all standard operating procedures, including those required by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, as well as those that we developed in order to maintain our operation.  We train our employees in those procedures that they are expected to follow in performing their duties and provide review training at appropriate intervals.  We installed and maintain automatic devices designed to prevent and respond to the release of the materials involved in our operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nOur emergency response plan is written in order to comply with OSHA requirement as well as those of other applicable standards.  Situations covered by our plan include fires, tornadoes, hazardous materials incidents, and personal injuries.  Actions to be taken in these situations include initial fire fighting measures, evacuations, hazardous materials containment procedures, and appropriate first-aid measures.\n\n\n\nAll employees are trained in the proper methods of plant evacuation in the event of a fire.  Members of the safety team receive additional training in order to assist  in plant response emergencies so that efficient plant evacuations can be effe"

Some safety team members, as first responders, also receive portable fire extinguisher training.\n\n\n\nAll fire alarms, whether remotely sensed or manually activated, are automatically transmitted to the local fire department for response.  This department is involved in routine inspections of our facility and also in awareness training of other local fire departments at our plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nNo changes are presently planned regarding methods and practices to improve safety.  However, if we become aware of a situation  that provides for additional operational safety and it requires changes to our overall operating plan, we will not hesitate to make whatever changes that are necessary."
