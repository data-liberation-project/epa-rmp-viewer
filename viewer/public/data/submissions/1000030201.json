The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (aerosol packaging) is designed, operated and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to prevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take\n\nin the event of a release.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: APG, located at 2730 Middlebury\n\nStreet, Elkhart, Indiana, offers full service custom packaging for various consumer product industries, such as pharmaceutical, household, cosmetic, personal care, and automotive care. The products packaged for these industries consist of liquids, semi-liquid creams, lotions, and aerosols. Some of the types of products that APG packages include: hair mousse, cooking sprays, household cleaners, tire cleaners, air fresheners, breath\n\nspray, etc. Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the containers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. The regulated chemicals used as propellants in the aerosol packaging process are:\n\n\n\nButane (CAS No. 106-97-8);\n\nDifluoroethane (CAS No. 75-37-6):\n\nDimethylether (Methyl ether) (CAS No. 115-10-6);\n\nIsobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5);\n\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6);\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the following chemicals are not normally present at the facility, but may be utilized as propellants should product specifications require:\n\n\n\nPentane (CAS No. 109-66-0); and\n\nIsopentane (CAS No. 78-78-4).\n\n\n\nProcess equipment includes propellant storage tanks, a tank farm for ingredients, filling, "

Due to the nature of the operations, involving variable types and quantities of regulated substances, this Risk Management Plan involves Predictive Filing.\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: APG maintains a Process Safety Management program for its\n\naerosol packaging process operation and maintenance. The PSM program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the aerosol packaging process. Some of the safety measures that are in place to ensure the safety of APG employees and the surrounding community include:\n\n\n\nGas dectection systems are installed in areas where there is a potential for hazardous levels of flammable gas to accumulate.\n\nState of the art explosion suppression systems have been installed in all areas where flammable gas is transferred to aerosol containers. These systems are designed to detect and extinguish an ignition before a catastrophic explosion can occur.\n\nAll storage tanks that store hazardous materials are inspected on a periodic basis.\n\nPeriodic inspections are performed to ensure that all process equipment is adequately grounded. This reduces the chance of hazardous static electricity discharge that could ignite flammable vapors.\n\nTankers are equipped with emergency shutdown capability, adding to the safety of the unloading process.\n\nPressure relief valves are installed on the storage tanks and piping systems.\n\nStandardized operating procedures are utilized for unloading and handling of flammable materials.\n\nVentilation systems are installed to prevent the accumulation of flammable vapors in processing areas.\n\nWater canons are installed near the propellant tanks to aid in cooling tanks, or assist if fire fighting, if required\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidents or injuries rela"

The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills and releases of chemicals, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details actions to be taken by APG for such emergencies, safety equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders. The APG emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), RCRA Contingency Plan (40 CFR 265.5) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained our employees for emergency response action and maintain a written response plan. The plan has been coordinated with the Elkhart Fire Department and Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee\n\n(LEPC).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
