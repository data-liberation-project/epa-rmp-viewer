Regency operate natural gas processing plants in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. The Jal #3 gas plant is located northeast of Jal, New Mexico, in Lea County, NM.  The plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nThis facility gathers raw field natural gas for processing. The facility and system of pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, New Mexico Environmental Department, New Mexico Water Quality Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department of Transportation. These agencies conduct periodic facility inspections and report any findings to SUGS corporate management.\n\n\n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA PSM standard. These agencies conduct periodic facility inspections and report findings to Regency management. This facility receives gas from surrounding oil and gas fields and other sites. Gas is received in the Jal #3 facility with the hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and water removed. The natural gas liquids as well as the compressed natural gas are then transported from the facility through pipelines to third party customers.\n\n\n\nThe two compounds in the facility that contain substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) in the amounts greater than threshold quantity are demethanized natural gas l"

The NGL is made up of RMP regulated substances of ethane, propane, butane, methane, etc.\n\n\n\nThere are no public receptors within the distance of the endpoint of the worst case scenario. There have been no releases of regulated substances that have created emergency response activities with the surrounding public agencies. Emergency response activities are coordinated with local responders; the facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release would be the loss of all of the NGL in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion. Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPA RMP Comp. the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.5 miles. An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.\n\n\n\nPotential releases have been discussed with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Lea County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\n\nThe Jal #3 Gas Plant operates under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety has helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few e"

Turbine  engine room to automatically shut down the compressor in case of fire.\n\n. Installation of pumps with dual seals and an indicator to show primary seal failure.\n\n. Installation of a continuous lit natural gas flare.\n\n. Fire water monitors that will spray water onto equipment.\n\n. Emergency shutdown valves for removing the product from the system during emergency situations along with automatic pump shutdown.\n\n\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped plant to operate safely.\n\n\n\nNo incident having resulted in offsite or onsite impacts from a RMP regulated substance has occurred at the Jal #3 Gas Plant within the last five years. Daily emphasis on prevention and safety programs should ensure this record continues.\n\n\n\nAn ongoing dialogue with the Lea County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops. In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) specific to the facility is in place and has been coordinated with the Lea Volunteer Fire Department and the Lea County Sheriff. The Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions. The ERP in place deals with evacuation procedures, training, etc. The ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Jal #3 Gas Plant.
