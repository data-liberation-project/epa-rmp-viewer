If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify the\n Woden Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of Facility:\n This facility is a retail farm supplier. We sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers for the purpose of crop \n production. On site we have a 30,000 gallon storage tank and an 18000 gallon storage tank. These\n tanks are filled to a maximum of 85% capacity to allow for product expansion.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n Our worst case scenario is a gas release from one of the storage tanks. According to EPA's RMP Comp\n the distance to endpoint is 3.20 miles. There are residences, a school and recreation areas within the\n distance to endpoint, with a total of 322 people being affected.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release statement is a transfer hose failure. According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles with residences and a school within this distance, with a total of one person being affected. \n\nThis facility has excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs installed to minimize the chances of a release occurring. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation of the equipment and the facility. We have also installed concrete barriers in traffic pattern areas in an effort to eliminate damage from a vehicualr accident.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations. This facility is annually inspected by in-house personnel and by the Iowa Department\n of Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n We have never had"
