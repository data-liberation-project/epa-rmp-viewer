The Facility Policy\n      The owners, management, and employees of Mason Hall Grain Co., Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. The maximum quanity stored would be 196,300 pounds in our three storage tanks 2-6,000 gallon and 1-30,000 gallon. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tanker holding 42,000 pounds.\n3.   The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n       a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 140,200 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n       b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .40 miles.\n4.     The accidental release prevention program.\n        This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5.     The Five-year History.\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous a"

The emergency response program.\n         This facility has :\n         a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n         b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n         c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.     Planned changes to improve safety.\n        Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
