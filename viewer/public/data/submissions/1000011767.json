The facility is composed of manufacturing areas, office space, parking lots, aboveground storage tanks, warehouse space, and truck maintenance and washing area. Operation of this facility began in 2008.\nTAPI is a producer of polyurethane foam produced by the reaction of an isocyanate group with an alcohol or hydroxyl contributor (polyol) in the presence of water and catalyst. The reaction is started in a reaction mixer and continued in a container to allow the expansion and blowing off the heat and gases formed and the molding of the foam.\nEmployees collect the foam blocks and store them for curing in a designated area of the warehouse. Usually, the foam is ready for further cutting and processing in 24 hours. \nTAPI uses a listed chemical that exceeds the threshold quantity established in the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.130). This chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer). \nThere are no regulated flammable substances used in the manufacturing process that exceed the threshold quantity.\nTAPI has performed and has documented an Offsite Consequence Analysis for the accidental release of TDI, following the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis document and utilizing the RMP.Comp software for endpoint distance estimation. The report on this analysis is part of this Risk Management Plan documentation.\n\nAccidenta"
