The facility is composed of manufacturing areas, office space, parking lots, aboveground storage tanks, warehouse space, and truck maintenance and washing area. Operation of this facility began in 2008.\nTAPI is a producer of polyurethane foam produced by the reaction of an isocyanate group with an alcohol or hydroxyl contributor (polyol) in the presence of water and catalyst. The reaction is started in a reaction mixer and continued in a container to allow the expansion and blowing off the heat and gases formed and the molding of the foam.\nEmployees collect the foam blocks and store them for curing in a designated area of the warehouse. Usually, the foam is ready for further cutting and processing in 24 hours. \nTAPI uses a listed chemical that exceeds the threshold quantity established in the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.130). This chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer). \nThere are no regulated flammable substances used in the manufacturing process that exceed the threshold quantity.\nTAPI has performed and has documented an Offsite Consequence Analysis for the accidental release of TDI, following the EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis document and utilizing the RMP.Comp software for endpoint distance estimation. The report on this analysis is part of this Risk Management Plan documentation.\n\nAccidenta"

The program complies with all applicable federal, state and local regulations for the prevention of accidents or releases of hazardous substances. Some of the actions taken at the facility to prevent accidental release include the following:\nA?    Periodic inspection of storage tanks, lines, pumps, valves, etc.\nA?    Manual inspection of level indicators prior to loading of the tanks to prevent overfilling\nA?    Storage tanks are located inside concrete dikes and sheltered to prevent corrosion.\nA?    Automatic shutoff control systems are installed to safely stop the process in case of electrical power loss or any other abnormal condition.\nTech Aerofoam Products International, Inc. has implemented a training program, with both classroom instruction and on the job training for its employees. Employees participate, on a regular basis, on the training sessions as part of A?Programa de Seguridad y Salud OcupacionalA? of the company. Please refer to the Operating Manual of this program for more details. \nAlso, as part of the A? Programa de Seguridad y Salud OcupacionalA?, there is an incident investigation procedure which is carried out, as necessary, to determine the root cause of any accident or unsafe condition to prevent recurrence.\n\nFive year Accident History\nThere is no 5-year accident history involving Toluene Diisocyanate, as defined by EPA in 40 CFR 68.42, for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan since this is a new facility whereto Tech Aerofoam Products International, Inc. is relocating its operations  in 2008.
