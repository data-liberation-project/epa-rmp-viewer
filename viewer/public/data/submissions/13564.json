      "SummaryText": "White River Cooperative, Inc., tries to do everything feasible to ensure that all business activities are completed with as minimal risk as possible.  Employees receive training in safety and operations as we strive to minimize the potential release of product due to human error.  The facility is located on approximately two acres, one-fourth mile south of the branch office, contains the anhydrous storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and redistributed as a crop nutrient to our farmer owners.  Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 120,000 pounds, 14,380 gallons.  The worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint concentration of 200 ppm at 1.10 miles from the storage tank.  As an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount of ammonia released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .40 mile from the storage tank.  White River Cooperative has instituted procedures for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist.  We have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.42 within the last five years.  Our Emergency Response Plan is in place and has been reviewed with current employees and they have been trained in the procedures.  All new hires will receive training prior to any exposure to ammonia.  Local emergency responders  have received training in the hazards associated with responding to an anhydrous ammonia incident.  White River Cooperative has policies in regards to equipment maintenance and the handling and transportation of hazardous materials, including anhydrous ammonia.  We will utilize periodic inspections to maintain compliance and improve safety  for all employees and the surrounding community and environment.  We will do product pre-transfer inspections of equipment and appurtenances and through these processes and inspections"
