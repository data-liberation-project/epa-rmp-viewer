      "SummaryText": "1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\nCoorsTek has a long standing commitment to operating our facility in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  A primary aspect of this commitment is the CoorsTek system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, CoorsTek has procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The CoorsTek emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, CoorsTek established a management system headed by the Production Manager to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  CoorsTek and Regulated Substances\n\n\nCoorsTek, located in Benton, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of aluminum oxide, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide products.  To manufacture one of our products, CoorsTek utilizes two regulated substances with one substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The following table lists the CoorsTek covered process under the RMP Rule and PSM and the associated Regulated Substances with their respective maximum quantities:\n\nProcess Descript"

The regulated substances were evaluated for a possible worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that CoorsTek has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worst-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, CoorsTek has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\nCoorsTek completed the Hazard Assessment and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emegency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has recently been updated to reflect changes in population estimates.\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program Program 3\n\n\nThe CoorsTek Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program req"

The Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nCoorsTek maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n? physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n? chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n? operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n? design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n? specific chemical inventories.\n\nCoorsTek ensures that the process safety information is available to all CoorsTek employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The Production Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and manufacturer guides.  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of methyltrichlorosilane and other chemicals used in our processes.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\nCoorsTek also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes:\n\n? materials of construction,\n? design pressures,\n? temperature ratings,\n? electrical ratings,\n? flow limits,\n? block flow diagrams,\n? consequences of deviation from operating limits,\n? safety systems,\n? applicable design codes and standards,\n? process chemistry, and\n? design basis for relief and ventilation systems.\n\nWhen information was not available for design documents, it"

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to aid in the safe and proper operation of the process.  These documents are used to:\n\n? train employees,\n? perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n? help maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nCoorsTek performed and will periodically update the process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, CoorsTek primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.

The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the Production Manager for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nCoorsTek engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Silicon Carbide Chemical Vapor Deposition Process operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n? unit startup,\n? normal operations,\n? temporary operations,\n? emergency shutdown,\n? normal shutdown, and\n? initial startup of a new process.\n\nThe written operating procedures include:\n\n? steps for safely conducting process tasks,\n? applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process \n  deviations, and\n? safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment \n  requirements, and action(s) to take in the event of an exposure to a hazardous substance.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nCoorsTek trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.
