The Reporting software gives an error on this data due to longtitude being set in a differnt county (Bulloch County) and Latitude being in Evan County.  We feel this is just an error on the set point of the software.  Therefore the Longitude has been altered to override the county set points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Claxton Poultry is complying with OSHAA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPAA\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \r\n\r\n2.

Refrigeration is necessary for conditioning the room air in production areas, cooling water used as a secondary coolant, and maintaining product at desired temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia was selected because of its excellent heat transfer capabilities.\r\n\r\n3.  Accident History\r\nThe facility has had no reportable accidents within the last five years.\r\n\r\n4.  Emergency Response\r\nTechnicians responsible for the safe operation have received HAZMAT training.  The Process Safety and Risk Management program requires that the individuals responsible for the emergency operations receive annual training.  The state of Georgia is equipped with a HAZMAT team to assist the plant.  The plant will continue to update and review the emergency response program with all additional employees.\r\n\r\n5.  Changes to improve safety\r\nClaxton Poultry is very grateful of their employees and stresses their safety.  For this reason new employees go through orientation prior to employment.  The plant employs a full time safety director.  The corporate office also has a safety director, and the plant performs audits of the operation continuously.\r\n\r\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\r\n\r\nThe Claxton Poultry complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPAA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-The-Job training (OJT).  They are observed and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.

This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release. \r\n\r\nWe work very closely with the Evans County Emergency Planning Commission and the Claxton Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Claxton Poultry trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our total ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed annually and updated periodically. Our program is improved continuously through annual updated of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia training program consists of in-house and outsourced classroom training, viewing various training/safety videos and written testing procedures.  The training will be conducted on at least an annual basis."
