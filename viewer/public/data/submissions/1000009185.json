      "SummaryText": "Stationary source and regulated materials handled: SWD Urethane Company is involved in the manufacture and distribution of polyurethane raw materials and acrylic coatings into the construction and manufacturing industries.  In conjunction with this business, the facility at 539 S. Drew Streets in Mesa, Arizona conducts several processes using 3 regulated materials: aqueous ammonia (in less than threshold quantities), propylene Oxide and formaldehyde.  Only the process for the manufacture of Polyol using Propylene Oxide and Formaldehyde utilizes regulated materials in significant quantities.\n\nThe process to manufacture polyol utilizes 2 regulated materials:\n\nPropylene Oxide:    Storage Quantity (Max):    71000 lbs.\nFormaldehyde:    Storage Quantity (Max):    58000 lbs.\n\nBoth of these materials are used as reactants.\n\nEach of these materials is stored in secondary containment to minimize the release of material in the event of failure.  For Propylene Oxide, there is 24 hour automatic monitoring for leaks.  In the event of release, the Mesa fire department will be notified by telephone to respond.\n\nAccidental release prevention program: The company is in compliance with the requirements of the OSHA PSM program rule.  All elements have reviewed, re-validated and/or updated prior to this review (June 2009).  All incidents have been reviewed, and the appropriate presentation steps taken.\n\nFive-year accident history: There have been no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency response plan: SWD Urethane has an emergency response plan, but is a non-responding facility.  In the event of an accidental release, emergency responders will be notified to handle spill cleanup.  Periodic meetings with local facilities have been held.\n\n"
