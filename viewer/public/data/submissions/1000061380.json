Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical, Central Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County Sheriff which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  The facility operates five covered process, which utilize four regulated substances.  These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, and phosgene [carbonic dichloride].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.   Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] is used for chemical synthesis.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.   \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The offsite consequence analysis was performed per 40 CFR 68.25 using EPA's RMP Comp.  \n\n\n\nOne alternative case offsite consequence"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State of Arkansas Building Code.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.
