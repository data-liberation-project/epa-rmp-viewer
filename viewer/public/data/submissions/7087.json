The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAllyl Alcohol:\n\nThe worst case scenario for Allyl Alcohol involves the failure of Fresh Allyl Alcohol Storage Tank T-507 which is a 16500 gallon pressure vessel. This failure results in 90,800 pounds of Allyl Alcohol being spilled into the Tankfarm Containment Area, a diked concrete structure. The Allyl Alcohol will fill the existing trench and sump system and then spread across the concrete floor of the storage area. The conditions used for this scenario were the EPA OCA parameters for this substance using the Dense Plume Lookup Tables. No other mitigating controls or equipment were used. This scenario would impact off-site public receptors such as residences, schools, small businesses, recreational facilities and adjacent chemical plants. \nAll Allyl Alcohol storage tanks are inside concrete diked containment. The area has a collection trench and sump with a sump pump to remove spilled material to alternative storage vessels. Each tank has a transfer pump capable of emptying the tank contents in about 90 minutes. The Allyl Alcohol storage tank is kept to a maximum volume of 80 % or 12, 818 gallons at any one time.

All vessels have nitrogen blanketing and automatic pressure relief valves discharging to the flare header.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAllyl Alcohol:\n\nThe Alternate Scenario involves a leak of Allyl Alcohol from a failed ball valve in the pump suction of Transfer Pump P-554 during a batch transfer to Reactor R-101. The Bleed Valve is a 3/4\" ball valve with standard trim which would cause a leak proportional to a 1/2\" hole. We assumed that the operator assigned to the task was called away from the tank where he would normally remain until the 30 minute transfer was complete. We also assumed that the pump would provide enough flow that the automatic low flow shutdown would not activate and trip the pump and control valves. All of the material spilled would be contained in the trench and sump system and the suction block valve would be closed 15 minutes after the spill was discovered. The spilled Allyl Alcohol would be transferred from the sump to a storage tank and the trenches washed with water to remove residual material. The Toxic Endpoint was calculated using the EPA OCA method. No public receptors of any type would be affected by this more likely release scenario. No other mitigating controls or equipment were used for this scenario.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nNo RMP listed flammable chemicals are stored on site at this time.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nNo RMP listed flammable chemicals are stored on site at this time.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive appro"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1. All storage tanks are equiped with level and pressure transmitters and alarms.\n\n2. All storage vessels are minimum 15 psig rated, automatic pressure controls and rupturedisks are provided to prevent tank rupture due to overpressure.\n\n3. All reactors used in Allyl Alcohol or Propylene Oxide service have redundant pressure relief valves that vent to a 16,500 gallon liquid knockout vessel prior to venting to the plant flare. This prevents a release of liquid from the flare due to any upset conditions.\n\n4. Reactor vessels in Allyl Alcohol or Propylene Oxide service have control interlocks for raw material flow, temperature, high pressure, differential temperature and pressure, agitator operation and Cooling Water pump operation. These all serve to prevent release due to upsets or uncontrolled reactions.\n\n5. Storage tanks in Allyl Alcohol service are limited by administrative controls to a maximum volume of 80% of capacity and the volume of pure Allyl Alcohol between campaign is reduced to 2,000 gallons.\n\n6. Storage of Propylene Oxide is limited to 80% of full volume administratively and 85% maximum volume by automatic level control devices. The storage vessel level is lowered to a maximum level of 3,000 gallons between product campaigns.\n\n7. All reactor vessels and piping are pressure and vacuum tested prior to project startup as part of the Safe Operating Procedure.\n\n8. Fugitive emissions testing is conducted on all equipm"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n1. Improved handling of process catalysts and provide individual training on handling each catalyst.\n\n2. Revise the relief valve system on the catalyst storage tank.\n\n3. Ship all catalyst in bulk and return unused portions to alleviate safety concerns associated with long term catalyst storage.\n\n4.
