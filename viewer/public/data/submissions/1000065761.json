The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change(MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Supervalu has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a component for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Indianola facility. Lastly the PSM Program incorporates the facilities emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire department and other response agencies.

UNFI's Indianola Distribution Center is located on Hwy. 49 South in Indianola. UNFI employs approximately 200 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management (RMP) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and OSHA Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM).  To date, UNFI's New Stanton DC has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents, or the environment.   \n\n   \n\nPursuant to RMP/PSM regulations, UNFI - Indianola, MS has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and subsequent 5 Year PHA Revalidations for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA's were completed using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as ammonia refrigeration contractors and Corporate Personnel. \n\n\n\nUNFI's implementation of the PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system.

The alternative release is included in The RMP is based upon a line break on the condenser. Although such releases are highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\n\n\nUNFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the refrigeration process at the UNFI - Indianola, MS facility.  Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. UNFI - Indianola, MS's employees are involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at UNFI - Indianola, MS should be address to Mike Mahaffey the Facility Manager at UNFI - Indianola, MS."
