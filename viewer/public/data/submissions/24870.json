These materials include the Risk Management Program (RMP) guidance to help our facility prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that, when integrated, minimize public risk of hazardous chemical release exposure.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with the specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements.\n\nOverall responsibility for all facility activities including Risk Management Program activities, lie with the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager has delegated the following responsibilities:\n\n\"    RMP hazard assessment and document control to the Environmental Manager\n\"    Implementation of the RMP prevention program to the Operation Manger\n\"    Development and maintenance of the RMP emergency response program to the Operation Manager\n\"    Training and communication of RMP related matters to the Operation Manager.\n\nMore specific responsibilities are delegated to other staff positions as detailed in the Plant Emergency Response Plan.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSepton is committed to conduction its operations in a safe, responsible manner and reducing risks to health and environment.  Compliance with all applicable legal requirements is mandatory and considered essential to upholding the company's commitment.  Septon's Environmental, Health and Safety programs include policies, procedures, standards and guidance materials designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nSepton, located in Pasadena, Texas, manufactures styrene thermoplastic elastomers (Septon?) in a batch polymerization process.

      "SummaryText": "used in the production of consumer goods such as pen grips, shock absorbing tools, tennis shoes and disposable diapers.\n\nTwo RMP regulated substances are present on site at the Septon facility.  The substances are 1, 3 butadiene and isoprene, both are classified as flammable materials in the RMP rule.  The chemicals are raw materials for the manufacturing of thermoplastic elastomers.  The maximum quantity of 1, 3 butadiene is 467,000 pounds, for isoprene 349,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) in Program 3 is an instantaneous loss of the maximum inventory on site of 1, 3 butadiene (467,000 pounds).  The maximum endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.6 mile.  \n\nNo Program Level 1 or 2 processes containing regulated toxic chemicals were identified at the facility.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) modeled is a vapor cloud explosion of 1, 3 butadiene  resulting from the release of 435 pounds of the material from a leaking off-loading arm coupling during the unloading of a truck of 1, 3 butadiene.  The estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.04 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIn general, Septon has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential of a release of any chemical on site.  All storage tanks are located within dike areas; truck unloading facilities are equipped with low pressure alarms, automated shut-off valves and are located within dike areas.  All of the process areas at the facility subject to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes containing 1, 3 butadiene and/or isoprene that are subject to the EPA RMP Rule have been incorporated into the OSHA PSM program.  Thus a program is in place that is in compliance with both the OSHA and RMP regulations.  Specific elements of the program include the following,\n\n\"    Employee participation in process safety management and accident prevention\n\"    Process Safety Information\n"

The 1, 3 butadiene tank is located in a secure dike area.  There are no flammable substances stored within the dike area.  In the unlikely event of a tank rupture, the dike surrounding the tanks will minimize the spread of the 1, 3 butadiene and significantly reduce the impact of the spill.  \n\nPrevention steps for the Alternate Case Scenario consist of remote control shutoff valves located at each end of the truck.  Additionally the off loading line can be shutdown down stream of the unloading site.  Operators are trained according to a documented procedure for the loading and unloading of butadiene.  Personal protective equipment is located at the unloading area to assure quick response to any potential spill.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nSince the Septon facility is a new facility, there is no five year history for documentation.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Septon Emergency Response Plan is based upon the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 standards, as well as meeting RMP requirements.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\nSepton maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and the general public as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.
