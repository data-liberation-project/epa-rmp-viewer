      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\n\r\nThe Linde facility at Claremore, OK is a carbon dioxide purification plant.  We receive carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct from a nearby chemical plant.  Normally, this carbon dioxide gas is vented to the atmosphere, but it is collected and transferred to our facility via pipeline.  Linde purifies and liquefies the carbon dioxide using a simple process of drying and distillation.  The final liquid carbon dioxide product is stored in our insulated storage tanks, and is shipped by truck and railcar to customers throughout the country.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPC; Anhydrous Ammonia.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the carbon dioxide production process, the Claremore facility uses a standard ammonia refrigeration process to purify and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  Similar to the Freon used in a home refrigerator, the ammonia is neither produced nor consumed in the process, but is repeatedly compressed, cooled and expanded in order to produce the cold temperatures necessary to cool and condense the carbon dioxide gas.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\n\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health and environmental affairs.  Our safety, health and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment.  This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operation safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities.  Linde is Committed to the continuous improvement of these programs. \r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Resp"
