      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan for Chlorine Gas\r\nFort Collins Water Treatment Facility\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nES.1\tIntroduction and Background\r\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act (CAA Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. The plan must also include mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact on the public in the unlikely event of a release. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 Code of Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\r\nThe Fort Collins Water Treatment Facility (FCWTF) supplies water to the City of Fort Collins, Colorado. Chlorine is used at the FCWTF primarily to disinfect drinking water prior to distribution and is a regulated toxic substance under the RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68). The FCWTF takes safety very seriously and has not had a reportable incident related to chlorine since the RMP regulations were enacted. The FCWTF has voluntarily installed a chlorine scrubber to neutralize the chlorine in the event of a chlorine leak. If a leak occurs, it should not pose a threat to the outside environment or the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nES.2\tHazard Assessment\r\nThe RMP consists of three major elements; the Hazard Review, Prevention Program and Emergency Response. A Hazard Assessment has been performed to determine the effects of a release of the regulated substance on the public and is not included in this Executive Summary for security reasons. The prevention program is designed to improve the system security and decrease the likelihood of a release. The emergency response program has been developed to deal with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur.\r\n\r\nES.3\tPrevention Program\r\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergenc"

Details of the Prevention Program are outlined below:\r\n\r\nES.3.1\tSafety Information\r\nAll of the required process safety information was compiled as required by the RMP regulations. The information meets, and in many cases exceeds, the minimum required.\r\n \r\n\r\nES.3.2\tHazard Review\r\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted on May 14, 2019, to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information was used by FCWTF staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHA.\r\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of FCWTF facility staff familiar with the process, operation, and maintenance, along with City of Fort Collins Regulatory and Government Affairs and Health and Safety staff. Based on the results of the PHA, no major changes in operating, maintenance and other process safety management procedures that improve the overall safety of the FCWTF were identified. The FCWTF is certified in the ISO 14001 standard (Environmental Management Systems) and continually reviews key processes, including chlorine procedures, training, and other documentation, to determine if any corrective or preventative actions are required.\r\n\r\nES.3.3\tOperating Procedures\r\nOperating procedures for the chlorination process were developed prior to the RMP. The operating procedures include start-up, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures. The procedures also safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and corrective actions necessary. These procedures are reviewed, revised, and re-issued to staff annually.\r\n\r\nES.3.4\tTraining\r\nFCWTF staff has received initial training on the safety information and operations and maintenance of the chlorine system. In addition to the initial training, select FCWT"

      "SummaryText": "F staff are trained in accidental release and emergency response procedures. To obtain state licensure as a water treatment plant operator, it is required that FCWTF operators pass chlorine-related process and safety examinations.\r\n\r\nES.3.5\tMaintenance\r\nThe FCWTF maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS; Maximo) to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the FCWTF staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including the need for lockout/tag-out and confined space entry provisions.\r\n\r\nES.3.6\tCompliance Audit\r\nAn internal compliance audit has been conducted at the FCWTF at least once every three years beginning June 21, 1999, for the chlorine process. An internal compliance audit for chlorine was conducted at the FCWTF on April 19, 2017. A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered process and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP requirements and audit techniques conducted the audits. The Director of Plant Operations (DPO) and the audit team promptly determine and document the appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and specify the dates by which corrective actions must be taken.\r\n\r\nES.3.7\tIncident Investigation\r\nA process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes. On the incident report form, the DPO will identify which recommended system changes are approved for implementation. The incident report and any system changes resulting"

The emergency response procedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through either leak stoppage or hazardous material (HAZMAT) assistance. The emergency response procedures include plans for leak investigation and communication with additional support agencies. In addition, critical plant operations are identified to ensure that, if possible, the critical FCWTF functions remain functional during an emergency response event.\r\nThe Emergency Planning and Response Plan complies with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95 and was updated in March of 2017."
