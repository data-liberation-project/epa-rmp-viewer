The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms has updated the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility.

In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on backup support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.\r\n\r\nThe Fresno Poultry facility is located immediatey north of Belgravia Avenue in Fresno, CA. The facility is located on approximately 20 acres. The Site is bordered by Channing Avenue to the west, Florence Avenue to the north,west Belgravia Avenue to the south , and Delno Avenue to the east. The area surrounding the facilities consists of industrial and commercial businesses. Highway 99 is approximately 1.5 miles to the northeast. \r\n\r\nThe facility was constructed in 1978-2000 for Zacky Farms. Foster Farms purchased the plant in October 2001.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products. The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility. The ammonia refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 37,389 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making. A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls. \r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. The facility has experienced four reportable accidents releases within the past five years. \r\n\r\nT"

      "SummaryText": "he RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Fresno Poultry ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. The high pressure receiver is connected to a diffusion panel and ammonia from the vessel can be mixed with water (neutralized) and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels. Additionally, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\r\n\r\nOther safety features at the facility include: \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown systems\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic king valve shutdown linked to emergency shutdown switches\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown switches to close king valve and stop compressors\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia Detection System\r\n\u00bf\tComponent specific safety shutdowns\r\n\u00bf\tSafeties are tested annually\r\n\u00bf\tPressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\r\n\u00bf\tThe high pressure receiver is connected to a fire diffusion panel\r\n\u00bf\tThe ammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\r\n\u00bf\tPressure relief valves are replaced at least every five years\r\n\u00bf\tA fire sprinkler system is installed in the plant\r\n\u00bf\tA central computer system monitors the refrigeration system and alarms when safety set-points are exceeded\r\n\u00bf\tOperators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place"

Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing. The critical mitigation measures suggested by the previous process hazard analysis teams have already been implemented. The status of significant mitigation measures is as follows: \r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia leak detection installed in all production areas and other areas containing ammonia equipment including the engine room and roof.\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic king valve shutdown linked to emergency shutdown switches installed.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency shutdown switches to close king valve and stop compressors installed.\r\n\u00bf\tLabeling of ammonia equipment and valves completed.\r\n\u00bf\tInstalled access platforms/walkways in all areas where routine access is required.\r\n\u00bf\tAdded a no water flow switch/temp probe with shutdown to the Redwater Chille"
