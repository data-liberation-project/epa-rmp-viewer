THROUGH A CONTINUAL SAFETY AWARENESS PROGRAM WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FACILITY CAN OPERATE IN A SAFE MANNER.  THROUGH VARIOUS PROCESS CONTROLS WE FEEL THAT WE CAN PREVENT AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF AMMONIA OR IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE CONTROLS IN PLACE TO MITIGATE DAMAGES.  COLUMBIA REACH PACK COMMUNICATES WITH THE VARIOUS EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES ON A REGULAR BASIS TO KEEP THEM EDUCATED AS TO THE DANGERS INVOLVED WITH AMMONIA.  WE ALSO PLAN TO HELP EDUCATE THE PUBLIC JOINTLY WITH OTHER FACILITIES AS TO THE CORRECT ACTIONS TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF AMMONIA.  COLUMBIA REACH PACK IS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN BE ASSURED THAT WE ARE STRIVING TO PROVIDE A SAFE FACILITY. \n\nRECENT UPDATES TO ENSURE SAFETY AT COLUMBIA REACH INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF WIND SOCKS OUTSIDE OF THE FACILITY TO ALERT OUTDOOR WORKERS OF THE WIND DIRECTION IN THE EVENT OF AN AMMONIA LEAK SO THAT THEY MAY BE AWARE OF THE DIRECTION OF THE TOXIC CLOUD IN ORDER TO AVOID IT.  SECONDLY,  WORKERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO USE AIR HORNS LOCATED IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE FACILITY TO NOTIFY OTHER WORKERS IN THE EVENT OF A LEAK.  WORKERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ASSEMBLE IN THE CAFETERIA IF SUCH AN EVENT OCCURS.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO WORST CASE SCENARIOS FOR AMMONIA LISTED.  FACILITY HAS CAPACITY TO HOLD 25,000 POUNDS BUT OPERATES ON 12,500 POUNDS."
