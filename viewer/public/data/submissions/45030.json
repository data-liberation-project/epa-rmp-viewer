The mangement and employees of the Seattle facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of acetylene. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the releases to the community and the environment. The facilities primary operation is the manufaturing, storage and distribution of acetylene. Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of calcium carbide into water in a reactor vessel. A chemical reaction takes place and the acetylene is compressed into the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to insure they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment. The worst-case scenario, based on EPA's definition for a flammable gas release and the alternative release, or more probable scenario were based on EPA guidelines using RMP COMP(ver. 1.07) to determine endpoints. Populations were determined using \"Landview V\" based on 2000 US census data. Results may be viewed by contacting the facility. Passive and active mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and emergency shut-off valves, flame arrestors, vent, relief valves, grounding equipment, rupture discs, purge systems, a preventative maintenance schedule for the system and safeties. The facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental release of acetylene. The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management prog"

Written process safety information was developed for the acetylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards. This information we utilized to develop Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of acetylene. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was reviewed and updated in January 2005 and will be updated in 5 years. Detailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected and safety and health precautions to be taken. The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process. The operating procedures are reviewed annually to reflect current operations. Employees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees. The training meets or exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200. Training includes; operating procedures,safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response, safety rules and procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization, and other pertinent process safety information. Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties. The training goals have been written and established in clear and measurable terms.

Employees are encouraged to actively participate. The employees are periodically evaluated via written tests, observation and/ or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed in July 2005. A contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors are hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of the employees and the public.The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance including, injury and illness rates and experience. In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills and knowledge and certifications are also verified as required. The contractors safety procedures were last reviewed in July 2005. Prestart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality standpoint. The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are completed. Other items completed prior to initial process start-up include; piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained. The initial start-up and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PSSR was conducted on 3/11/99. An on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process or handle acetylene has been designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize releases. The mechanical integrity program includes identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspections/tests and their frquencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maint"

This program was reviewed in July of 2005. Hazardous work or non-routine work is controlled in a consistent manner. The hazard identified is communicated to those performing the work and to the operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process. The Airgas Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or authorized issuer needs to manage hazardous work. The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas and excavationm procedures. The program includes confined space entry. The program was reviewed in July of 2005. Management of Change procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities. MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process reviews and approves the proposed changes. This would include both technical and mechanical changes. Process changes include all modifications of equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\". A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes. Management of Change procedures were reviewed in January 2006. Process incidents which result in or could have resulted in a release of acetylene are investigated, including \" near misses\", within 24 hours of the incident.

The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a release of acetylene. The plan complies with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and has been coordinated with the local fire department. The facilities response plan was reviewed and tested in August 2002. The facility recieves a compliance audit in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Standard 40 CFR part 68 at least once every three years. The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to ensure compliance. The team uses an audit tool to document each audit step and ensure an effective audit is conducted. A protocol policy has been developed to ensure the proper follow-up is accomplished. Airgas will make available all information, including any trade secrets information as it relates to compliance with this regulation. The facility emergency response plan has been integrated with the local community emergency response plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice per year to ensure it is current.
