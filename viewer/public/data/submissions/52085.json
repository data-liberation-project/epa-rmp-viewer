If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the following agencies:  Lawrence County LEPC, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and the local fire and police departments.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  This facility is a petroleum bulk terminal.  It is primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products.  Propane is contained within a combination of 6\", 8\" and 10\" diameter pipelines, below ground storage cavern and above ground storage vessels (bullets).\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  The worst case scenarios are considered to be a failure of the longest propane bullet (Tank 389) within the facility.  The resulting distance to the 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint does not extend offsite.  There are no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  This is a Program 1 facility which does not require an alternative release scenario.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  This facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management rule, DOT RSPA and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with EPA, DOT and state laws.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  We have not had a propane accident that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place during the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane storage and pipelines, it is our policy to notify the Lawrence County LEPC, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and the local fire and police departments.  This policy has been discussed with the fire department so that they may render assistance as necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES T"
