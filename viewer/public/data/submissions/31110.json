Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a  fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in heating and grain drying.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) is:\n\n             Tank Size (gallons)   Pounds at 85 %\n\n1 -  tank by office\n                18,000 gallons          78,795 lbs\n\n2 - Storage tank and Nurse tanks at UAP owned facility\n                 12,000 gallons           52,530 lbs\n                  12,000 gallons          52,530 lbs\nNurse Tanks  24 @ 1,000gal     105,060 lbs\n\n          \n\nWorst CaseScenaria and the  Alternative Release Scenario.  \na. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  T\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n    \nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines in the ANSI Standards. The repair of valves and pumps is done by an outside professional contractor.  \n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually,  whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulaions is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training includes; safety, operating procedures for plant startup, plant shutdowns, filling a nurse tank, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown ans startup after emergency shutdown.\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred at this location.\n\n6.The Emergency Response Program.    \n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.   In preparation for this, we have coordinated with the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to insure that our community has the strategy for responding to 0 and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Western Iowa Coop.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional new specific anhydrous ammonia or"
