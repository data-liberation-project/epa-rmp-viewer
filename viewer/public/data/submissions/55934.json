These ASTs range in capacity from 5,000 gallons to 18,000 gallons, which contain various combinations of propane, isobutane, and ethyl ether in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) presented under 40 CFR 68, more commonly known as the Risk Management Program.    These substances are considered regulated flammable substances by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and train our personnel combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Plan:  \nOur written Emergency Response plan is written in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulations 29 CFR 1910.38.  The purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of our employees in an emergency situation (fire, tornado, chemical spill, or other emergency).  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the St. Clair Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and the fire department has inspected this plant.\n\nPrevention Program:  \nPlaze has a prevention program in place that complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LP Gas storage and the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Employees have been trained of the procedures associated with the processes and the Emergency Action Plan, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the St. Clair Fire Department and any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n5-Year Accident History:  \nNo accidental releases have occurred in"
