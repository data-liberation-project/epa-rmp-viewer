The Company Officers, Managers and Supervisors are accountable to carry out policies of the company relevant to the prevention of hazardous materials releases.  Thrall Car has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent the accidental release of hazardous materials.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of Extremely Hazardous Material releases are set forth in EPAs Risk Management Program.  In the event a release occurs, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding, containing and reporting such releases.\n\n\nFacility Description and The Regulated Substance\n\nThrall Car Manufacturing Company is a heavy manufacturing facility.  The metals are cut, shaped and welded to produce a rail car.  After the rail car is assembled, it is moved through a paint shop where protective coatings are applied and dried.  The rail car is then ready for transport to the customer.  To provide heat for comfort and the drying rooms, natural gas is used.  During peak load periods, liquid propane is vaporized and mixed with air to be used in place of natural gas.  Thrall Car maintains as much as 110,000 pounds of propane in storage primarily as a back up for natural gas.  Propane is also used as a fuel for fork lifts that are used throughout the facility.\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nThrall Car is providing models of a Worst-Case Release and an Alternative Release Scenarios.  The Worst-Case Release involves the sudden failure of the propane storage tank.  An explosive cloud of propane is formed and explodes.  A model of the release indicates that a radius of 0.28 mile for the tank could be affected by the 1 psi or greater overpressure from the explosion.  The Worst-Case Release scenario is unlikely to occur due to the stringent construction standards and the ongoing mainte"

      "SummaryText": "nance and inspections plans.  The Alternative Release Scenario involves an accidental release when a propane delivery tanker driver pulls away without disconnecting a hose.  A 2 =  inch line is broken, releasing 28,000 pounds of propane.  The excessive flow valve has also failed.  The resulting cloud explodes and an overpressure end point of 1 psi is 0.03 mile for the tank is modeled.  The areas that are affected are determined by time of day and wind speed and direction.  This scenario was chosen because it could possibly happen and could result in a spill large enough to affect offsite receptors.  Again this is unlikely to happen due to training and maintenance requirements.  Both of these scenarios were modeled using the PhastProfessional computer modeling program.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrall Car Manufacturing Company has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  The programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA, EPA and NFPA regulations along with sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level of awareness when working with the propane system.\n\n\nFive-year Accident Release\n\nThrall Car Manufacturing Company has not had an accidental release of propane during the last five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThrall Car employees will only provide incipient action to accidental releases that do not put the employee in danger.  Thrall Car will utilize local fire departments as the primary responders to accidental releases.  Training onsite will be coordinated with the local Fire Chief and Thrall Car representatives.  Ron Collins will be the primary contact for Emergencies related to the propane system.  In the event that Mr. Colli"
