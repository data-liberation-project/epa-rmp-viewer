For example, these techniques may identify needed improvements in equipment or procedures. The techniques used can identify needed changes before an accident or help identify needed changes to prevent the possibility of more serious accidents."

The program address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, personnel accountability, notification of local emergency response agencies and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the refinery has procedures that address the use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, like the refinery's own fire trucks and the system to deliver water or foam for firefighting. Changes to the refinery that might require changes to the emergency response program are identified through the management of change system.\r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the emergency response procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. They are informed or trained in any changes that affect their duties. For example, all employees are trained in the emergency alarm and evacuation procedures, and many employees are trained in the use of portable fire extinguishers. There is also a team of highly trained employees who are volunteers to make up the refinery's emergency response team, which includes a fire brigade, hazardous material team and rescue team. The emergency response team is capable of responding to fire, hazmat and rescue emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program for the refinery is coordinated with the South Adams County Fire Protection District and the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

This includes classification, investigation and mitigation of risks and hazards identified by the investigation. The refinery employs an incident coordinator to oversee the incident management program and all incidents are reviewed by management. This includes reviewing incidents that may need to be investigated to comply with the requirements of PSM and RMP. This helps ensure that all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Investigations are conducted by a team of management, represented and contract employees (if a contractor was involved). The team produces a written report that includes finding, recommendations and learnings that are reviewed with management. Corrective actions are entered into the management system and tracked until completion. Investigation reports are available to all refinery employees. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during the next process hazard analysis update/revalidation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require an audit of the accidental release prevention program at least once every 3 years.
