This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nHyLife Foods - Windom, LLC senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. HyLife Foods - Windom, LLC's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Superintendent, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nHyLife Foods - Windom, LLC is located at 2850 Highway 60 E in Windom, Minnesota. The facility is located on the outskirts of the main city near Cottonwood Lake. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with mostly agricultural areas. The City of Windom is located south-southwest of the facility. The facility began operations in February 2017.  \n\n\n\nThe primary business of HyLife Foods - Windom, LLC is to provide cooling, processing, and storage of pork food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 35,415 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, dock operations, and processing.  Typical operating conditions range from 11 inches of mercury vacuum on the low pressure side of the system to 175 "

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the Machinery Room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the Machinery Room and just outside of the Machinery Room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve into a common header that vents to the atmosphere (except for the Air Handling Unit Surge Drums and Spray Chill Water Chiller Surge Drum which vent individually to atmosphere).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, HyLife Foods - Windom, LLC has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. \n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n?     On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or \n\n?     Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in p"

Therefore, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or that meet the definition above.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe HyLife Foods - Windom, LLC facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and put the facility's action plan into play to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, conducted on December 1, 2021 , including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the HyLife Foods - Windom, LLC facility.
