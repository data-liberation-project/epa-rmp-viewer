      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Eunice Loading Facility (the Facility), located near the town of Eunice in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facilityA?s processes.  The Company policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Facility is a truck and rail car loading facility capable of loading propane, n-butane, iso-butane and Y-grade that brought in by pipelines from the Eunice Natural Gas Extraction Plant. There are three (3) pressurized bullet tanks located at the Facility for storage of n-butane, iso-butane and Y-grade.  \n\nThe substances handled at the Facility were evaluated for toxic characteristics and it was determined that there are no toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity handled at the Facility.  The n-butane, iso-butane and Y-grade are flammable substances present at the Facility in excess of threshold quantities and, therefore, subject to this program.  Based on the worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint does not exceed the distance to public receptors; therefore, the Facility is classified as Program level 1.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1-psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion assuming an instantaneous release.  A yield factor of 10% of the available energy released in the explosion is used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is bas"

      "SummaryText": "ed on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Because of the quantities of n-butane present onsite, this product will present the worst-case flammable substance release that will result in the greatest distance to the endpoint, 0.47 miles.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThere are no toxic substances held above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required for this Facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe processes at the Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Facility has not experienced an accidental release in the past five (5) years.\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURE INFORMATION\n\nIn conjunction with the Eunice Natural Gas Extraction Plant, the Loading Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment in the event of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedure addresses notification of federal, state and local emergency response agencies as appropriate and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Facility facilities.  \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Facility is coordinated with the Local Emergency"

This coordination may include periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Facility provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the Facility.\n"
