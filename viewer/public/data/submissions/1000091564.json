Leal Terminal receives anhydrous ammonia from rail tankcars and/or tank trucks and dispenses anhydrous ammonia to tank trucks, truck dock loading arm consist of excess flow valves, for fertilizer application.  Both of the transfer processes are accomplished with ammonia transfer pump(s) and/or ammonia compressor(s).  The Leal Terminal also stores liquid anhydrous ammonia in an above ground storage tank (AST) within its facility.  The AST is surrounded by a containment dike, which is approximately 9 feet in height and has an interior area of 207,025 square feet.  The containment dike is visually inspected monthly and an professional certified survey is completed annually.   \n\n\n\nThe liquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in AST by refrigeration and in the ammonia bullet and railcars under pressure.  The AST has a capacity of 40,000 tons and 14 railcars containing 80 tons each can be stored on the rail spur.  As the results, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in the Leal Terminal is 41,120 tons.  Propane is stored in a AST with a capacity of 76,000 pounds.  The propane is used for heating product for loading, flare operation, and building heating. \n\n\n\nRationale for Risk Management Program Development, Implementation, and Update\n\n\n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require Environmental protection Agency EPA) to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of substances into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.  As the results of the 1990 Amendments, EPA issued the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) that requires affected facilities to develop and implement a risk management program.  The affected facilities include any facilities that handle, manufacture, store, or use above the sp"

The threshold quantities for ammonia to trigger the development and implementation of a risk management program are 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program is designed to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that does occur. Since Agrium is handling more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia, it is required to develop and implement a risk management program.  To comply with the RMP rules, Agrium implemented an RMP program at the Leal Terminal and submitted an RMP to EPA in 1999.  The Agrium's risk management program includes an offsite consequence analysis of a potential accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rules required that the RMP be updated at least every five years.  Agrium is updating the RMP for the Leal Terminal to comply with the rules.  However, offsite consequence analysis was not discussed in this Executive Summary as it was not required by the revised RMP rules published in CFR on April 2004.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the RMP update.  The five-year accident history covers:\n\n\n\n    - the release of ammonia from Agrium's facility.\n\n    - the release that caused at least one of the following:\n\n        - On site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (40 CFR\n\n          part 68.42(a)); or\n\n        - known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental \n\n          damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (40 CFR Part 68.42\n\n          (a)).\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, the Leal Terminal has had no releases that caused death, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on or off site.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Prog"

The MI program includes pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  All equipment are inspected/tested at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer.  The equipment tested most recently is the fire detection system November 2020. \n\n    \n\n    Incident Investigation\n\n    Agrium has communicated to all of its employees that it is every employee's responsibility to report incidents and near misses to their immediate supervisor.  After an incident is reported, an incident investigation team which includes the employees involved in the incident will initiate an incident investigation.  The incident will also be input into a computer program celled \n\nETQ that ties to the Agrium corporate office.  The leader of the incident investigation team is knowledgeable of the plant and have received formal training in incident investigation.\n\n    \n\n    Compliance Audit\n\n    A compliance audit of the Agrium facility will be conducted at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance of Agrium's process with the release prevention program (RPP).  The audit team will include one person knowledgeable in audit skills and techniques and team members with appropriate technical expertise.  A compliance audit of the Leal Terminal was completed on September 2018.\n\n    \n\n    Management of Change (MOC)\n\n    Agrium's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at Agrium will not result in undetected unsafe situations and employees will be aware of all changes and their implications.  The Agrium's MOC system includes the following considerations before any changes take place:\n\n    \n\n    - the authorization requirements for the change.\n\n    - the technical basis for the proposed change\n\n    - the impact of the change on health and safety.\n\n    - the necessary "
