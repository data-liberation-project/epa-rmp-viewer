Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years, reducing or eliminating the risk of such waterborne diseases as Cholera, Typhoid and Dysentery.\n\n\n\nThe City and County of Butte-Silver Bow (BSB) have long understood the potential hazards and risks in handling chlorine.  Chlorine exceeding the 2,500-pound threshold level is required to submit a Risk Management Program to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Basin Creek Reservoir has more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine on site.  The Risk Management Program Rule has helped enhance the existing safety programs such, as the respiratory protection plan, a regular maintenance program and an annual safety training program to address changes in the system and chemicals used at the facility.  It has also ensured that in the unlikely event of a chlorine release, local emergency responders and other authorities are fully trained and ready to engage specific plans to mitigate the situation quickly and safely.\n\n\n\nThe Basin Creek Reservoir has been a reliable water source for the community since 1893.  The facility was upgraded in 1990 and meets all requirements for a water distribution source.  It is a separate process from the Big Hole Water Treatment Facility but monitoring occurs at the Big Hole Water Treatment Facility and BSB operates it on daily basis.  In the past ten years, the reservoir has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine. The reservoir chlorinates on average 2.5-3 mgd and has a design capacity of 8 mgd.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) is designed to prevent and minimize the impacts of an accide"

The emergency plan includes how to respond to an incident at a local level as well as calling in first responders, such as the BSB Fire Department, the BSB Sheriff's Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the Montana Highway Patrol and protecting the citizens that surround the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Butte-Silver Bow Water Utilities Division has performed the necessary Hazard Assessments, Prevention Programs, and Emergency Response Plans.  The employees have been trained on the hazards and the procedures for handling chlorine at the Basin Creek Reservoir.  They have the knowledge and skills, as certified operators, to operate the treatment facility system to minimize a chlorine exposure.\n\n\n\nBSB is confident that the added protection of the Risk Management Plan will ensure that its personnel, the environment and the community will continue to remain safe and healthy.\n\n\n\nCinda Seys\n\nSafety and Risk Program Manager\n\nHuman Resources Department\n\nCity and County of Butte-Silver Bow"
