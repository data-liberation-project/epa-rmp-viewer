This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, Chevron Managing Safe Work Practices and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant, located in Odessa, Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to extract natural gas liquids from natural gas.  The Headlee Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including: Propane and Flammable Mixtures (containing Normal Pentane, Normal Butane, Iso-pentane, Iso-butane, Propane, Ethane and Methane).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Headlee Gas Plant.  Processes at the Headlee Gas Plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the Management System in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of Process Safety Management and accident prevention.  Examples of Employee Participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Proc"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Headlee Gas Plant currently has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Coordinator that assists in maintenance of up-to-date Process Safety Information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, flow, pressure) in the Operating Procedure Manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment in the Process Safety Information system of record, OpsDocs.  This information includes material of construction, equipment specification and drawings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " Headlee Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to assess hazards and safeguards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards and recommend additional measures, as appropriate.\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant utilizes Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP's) which are facilitated by trained PHA facilitators along with a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and safeguards, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\nThe PHA team findings are communicated to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team, following Chevron's HES Risk Prioritization Matrix.  The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked by the PSM/RMP Coordinator in the PHA system of record, \"Stature\", until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in Stature database for the life of the facility. The Headlee Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained in Stature.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) Initial startup, (2) normal startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) consequences of deviation (6) normal shutdown, and (7) emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes.  In addition, the Headlee Gas Plant maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Headlee Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify demonstrate (e.g., via verbal and written tests, skills demonstration, etc.) that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skil"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency action plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the MCBU Contractor Health, Environmental and Safety Management (CHESM) team evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel and the CHESM Team periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant conducts a fit for purpose PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the Process Safety Information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, controls, pumps and compressors in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include performing inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the proces"

Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. \n\n\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Headlee Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: an Isolation of Hazardous Energy (IHE) procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., Hot Work), and a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to manage changes to all covered processes.  This program requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the ch"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and notifies these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked in the IMS IMPACT database until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Chevron MCBU Base Business Process Safety Management Group periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
