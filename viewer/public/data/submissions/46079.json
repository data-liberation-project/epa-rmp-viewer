      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTacoma Water, which is a unit of Tacoma Public Utilities, supplies water to the City of Tacoma and the surrounding region.  The mission of Tacoma Water is:\n? Protect the public health of the people of Tacoma and our service area by providing high quality water service.\n? Make home life more enjoyable and economic development possible with the quality and reliability of the service we provide.\n? Act in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.\n? Make Tacoma a better place to live and work.\nConsistent with this mission, Tacoma Water adds chlorine to the water supply to kill any harmful microorganisms that may be present in the water.  At the McMillin Reservoir, an accident prevention program assures that the chlorination system is operated in a safe manner to protect employees and nearby residents.  An Emergency Response Plan is also established and drills are conducted to assure readiness should a chlorine release occur.\n\nOur Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nTacoma Water?s source is the Green River Watershed.  Water is collected and chlorinated at the Green River Headworks facility and then distributed to reservoirs throughout the water supply system.  At the McMillin Reservoir, chlorine lost due to disinfection or evaporation is replaced to maintain a safe residual chlorine level in the water.  Chlorine is regulated by the EPA?s Risk Management Plan Rule as a toxic substance.  The McMillin Reservoir therefore maintains a structured Risk Management Plan to prevent accidental releases and respond safely should one occur.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Safety Manual guides safety activities to prevent releases and assure compliance with the EPA Risk Management Plan rule and the WISHA standard for Process Safety Management of Hazardous Chemicals.  These activities include:\n? Involving employees in process safety management activities\n? Compi"

Using written operating procedures and certifying annually that they are current and accurate\n? Training operators and mechanics so they can perform those procedures safely\n? Maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment\n? Reviewing process changes to consider safety impacts\n? Conducting pre-startup safety reviews to confirm that changes were made as intended\n? Investigating any incidents that occur\n? Using a hot work permit system to prevent fires\n? Assuring that safety is considered when selecting contractors who will work on the process equipment\n? Auditing process safety management activities at least every 3 years to assure that they are effective.\n\nThe chlorination system is designed for safe operation using components specifically designed for chlorine service.  Chlorine is received in DOT-approved one-ton containers.  These containers are connected to the process using valves and flexible connectors built to specifications approved by the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine gas is supplied to a vacuum regulator, which supplies chlorine under vacuum to the chlorinators (devices that meter chlorine to the water supply).  The vacuum regulators have an important safety feature ? they will stop chlorine flow if vacuum is lost for any reason.  This prevents a chlorine release should any piping component fail downstream of the vacuum regulator.  Regular preventive maintenance is performed to maintain all parts of the process, both upstream and downstream of the regulator.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years there have been no accidents at the plant that resulted in or could have resulted in a catastrophic chlorine release.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is established for responding to accidental releases of chlorine.  Plant employees are trained to respond to a release so they can stop a small release from turni"

Chlorine detectors and alarms are installed to alert employees both on site and at the Tacoma Water Control Center that a leak has occurred.  Employees on-site will assess the reason for the alarm and organize appropriate response action, including summoning responders from Pierce County Fire and Rescue.  Drills are conducted annually to practice emergency response procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe McMillin Reservoir is scheduled for modifications in the next 5-10 years.  As part of this project the continued use of chlorine gas will be evaluated to determine if safer methods of water disinfection are feasible.  This is part of Tacoma Water?s continuing effort to install less hazardous treatment facilities where possible.  This effort has already replaced chlorine gas use at nine locations in the water supply system."
