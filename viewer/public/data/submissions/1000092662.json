Our policy is to establish, maintain, and implement emergency response procedures with the prime objective of protecting all persons from harm, minimize property damage and mitigate impacts to the environment. The safety of our employees, emergency response personnel and persons in affected areas are the highest priority in the initial stages of an emergency. Our accidental release and emergency response procedure is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training. Midstream LPG Inc. has developed a comprehensive accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operations at this facility. The Tacoma facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan specific to this location. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately shut down operations, notify the Tacoma Fire Department to request their assistance and initiate evacuation of the affected area if needed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nLiquid Propane is the only regulated chemical at our Tacoma facility. The facility is a bulk storage terminal that receives propane by railroad tank cars and truck transports. The facility has three railroad tank car unloading stations. Propane is distributed from this facility using truck transports and propane dealer delivery trucks. This facility consists of four 30,000-gallon ASME aboveground bulk storage tanks. Each tank contains approximately 107,000 pounds of liquid propane when filled to maximum capacity.\r\n\r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nMidstream LPG Inc. has developed and implemented the following general accidental release and prevention program elements in acc"
