Our safety program includes:\n\n1.\tProven and reliable controls and monitoring systems for all our critical operations;\n2.\tSpill prevention systems designed to minimize the possibility and the impact of spills;\n3.\tFully trained and equipped emergency response teams, available to respond around the clock.\n\nCalifornia instituted requirements for risk analysis and prevention programs before the U.S. EPA, so our facility prepared and submitted a Risk Management and Prevention Program in 1996. As part of the California program, we conducted an earthquake risk analysis and an extensive review of our process hazards. Our safety program was reviewed by an independent consultant working with our in-house safety experts, which resulted in a number of improvements to our program.\n\nFor the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program, we conducted a new hazard review which included a \u00bfWhat If ?\u00bf analysis. Potential spill scenarios were identified and the possibilities of off-site impacts were studied. Potential spill scenarios include releases from chemical storage tanks, from transfer piping, and spills from 55 gallon drums. The presence of containment trenches and sumps at our facility was taken into account in this analysis.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan covers one regulated substance \u00bf 70% hydrofluoric acid (HF) \u00bf used in a single process \u00bf chemical milling and cleaning of metals \u00bf which does not involve elevated temperatures or pressure. The maximum amount of 70% HF at the facility is 7,350 gallons. Most of the HF inventory is enclosed in a single enclosed rubber-lined steel storage tank located inside covered concrete walls. Small amounts of HF are in pipes which run from the storage tank to the process tanks where the HF is diluted to an 8% concentrat"

      "SummaryText": "ion used in the chemical milling process. For short periods of time, 70% HF can also be stored in 55 gallon drums (maximum four drums). \n\nThe Risk Management Plan also involves a review of the transportation of HF. The majority of the HF is received at Chem-tronics in bulk quantities from the manufacturer and is transferred directly from the transport truck to the enclosed storage tank. When HF is received in 55 gallon drums, they are off-loaded near the building where they are used in the chemical milling process.\n\nAs part of our hazard review, numerous spill scenarios were considered.  Because there is a containment wall around, and a cover over the storage tank, the worst case scenario was determined to be a release of the contents of the 2-in diameter piping used for bulk refilling of the supply storage tank.  The 36 gallon spill would be contained in trenches sloping to a large wastewater treatment sump.  Among the potential spills examined, this scenario\u00bfs spill and evaporation area was largest, thereby maximizing the potential offsite impacts..\n\nWe have reviewed our spill records for this Risk Management Plan, and in the past five years there have been no releases involving the HF process.  Experienced employees specially trained in spill prevention measures are in charge of the delivery operations and the chemical milling process. These employees are required to understand and follow specific procedures and safety rules. An additional margin of safety is provided by the fact that HF is used only at ambient temperatures and pressures. In addition, HF can be detected by smell at very low concentration if it is released.  The facility also maintains an Emergency Response Team that is trained to handle HF spills.  The team trains or conducts drills at least 4 times per year.  The local fire department (which is only a block away) and the county HAZMAT team representatives have attended these sessions.  Chem-tronics is in full compliance with the state Risk Manag"

      "SummaryText": "ement Prevention Plan rules, as well as those of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n \nIn the course of reviewing our procedures and rules, we identified in 1995 several measures to further improve safety at the facility:\n\n1.\tExpand the written procedure for 55-gallon drum handling and storage to include transfer to the pumping station\n2.\tImprove the design of the spill containment trenches and sump;\n3.\tDevelop a specific written procedure to ensure against spills during maintenance of the HF transfer pump;\n4.\tRe-designing the tanker truck access to the storage tank to reduce the chance of vehicle accidents;\n5.\tIncrease the separation between the HF storage tank and flammable chemicals.\n\nAll of these recommendations have either been implemented or are still being examined. Chem-tronics believes these improvements, in conjunction with our existing safety program, provide safe, effective conditions for the use of HF.\n\nIn 2003 numerous formal and informal reviews of the acid handling systems occurred.  As a result the tanker truck unloading procedures were modified and the employee Personal Protective Equipment plan was upgraded.  Recent developments in technology have resulted in improved gaskets for HF valve systems.  The HF valves are currently being replaced by valves with the new gasket material.  The facility has also decided that using 49% HF is safer than 70% HF.  The facility is currently switching over to this less concentrated material.  Final conversion to 49% HF is expected by fall of 2004."
