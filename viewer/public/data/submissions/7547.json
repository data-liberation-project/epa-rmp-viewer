If an emergancy should occur we will notify the Hawley Fire Dept. for emergency response.\n\n              Our facility is a retail agriculture supply center. Our facility consists of one NH3 storage tank with a loading riser and nurse tanks for delivering product.\n\n              Our worst case scenerio is failure of the storage tank when filled to its allowable capacity resulting in a toxic vapor cloud. The wind speed and direction will determine the number of residences and other affected buildings as to what evacuation plan will be utilized by the fire dept. and law enforcement personel.\n\n              Our facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all state, county, and local codes and regulations.\n\n              Our facility has never had an accident involving NH3 that caused deaths,injuries, property or environmental damage or evacuations.\n\n               In the event of an NH3 release we will notify the Hawley Fire Department and request that they respond to the facility and implement the Emergancy Action Plan that has been developed to provide protection for the surrounding area.\n\n              We feel confident we are doing everything possible for the safety of the surrounding area and we do not have any changes planned to improve safety at this time."
