The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Walla Walla, Washington has developed a Risk Management plan to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The City has one RMP covered process and it requires that facility with that process develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  \n\n\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\n\n\nThe Mill Creek Water Treatment Plant is located at 581 Mill Creek Road, Walla Walla, Washington.  The facility adds chlorine through their chlorination process in order to disinfect the City's water supply.\n\n\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to 8 one-ton containers at the chlorination process building.  Four one-ton containers are on-line at all times feeding the system. There are four more one-ton containers in storage.  Additionally up to 6 150-pound cylinders are occasionally stored in the chlorine building.  The highest possible chlorine inventory at any one time is 16,900 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is fully enclosed in a building. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine building is equipped with chlorine detectors.  The chlorine detectors are also interlocked to an audible and visual alarm at the site and audible and visual alarms on the Operators control panel.  When the Operator sees the chlorine alarm, he can dispatch City or County emergency response personnel to the site immediately if necessary.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThe chlorine process exceeds the threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places it in RMP program 3 level.  Walla Walla uses its PSM program as the required program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nWalla Walla has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Proc"

      "SummaryText": "ess Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This ensures that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Walla Walla also developed written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include operation of safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  Safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, and Hot Work Permit are reviewed and updated when necessary to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff also performed a PHA of the process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Auditing, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of facility management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\n\n\nThe Water Treatment Facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan in place. The program has been developed to comply with 29 CFR 1910.38.  In the event of an emergency, evacuation procedures are initiated. T"
