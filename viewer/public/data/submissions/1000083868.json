The Santa Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the employees, surrounding community, and the environment.  The Facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  This RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Maria Facility processes crude oil into intermediate products for further processing at other locations to produce transportation fuels.  The Facility receives crude oil from many sources via pipeline or truck, stores it in tanks onsite, and processes the crude oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, and truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into four products: gas oil, naphtha (pressure distillate), sulfur, and coke (solid carbon-based material).  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce low sulfur transportation fuels for the California markets. The gas oil and naphtha products are also stored in the Facility's Storage Tanks prior to shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and solid coke are shipped offsite by truck or railcar.  Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) gas is also present in some process equipment as a by-product of the refining process. The Facility also has the utility and support systems required to provide for safe operation of the plant, including a power generation"

Modeling of Worst Case release Scenarios (WCS) was conducted to identify the potential for onsite processes to affect the surrounding community and the environment.  The submittal includes the identification of prevention program elements, a summary of the emergency response program, and development of an executive summary. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident & Release Prevention Programs in place at the Santa Maria Facility.  The site is also regulated by Cal-OSHA and CalARP for Process Safety Management which has many similar requirements, so the terms PSM and RMP are used interchangeably in these program descriptions.  This summary addresses the applicable RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.  Each section below contains a brief summary of the prevention program elements and identifies the department responsible for implementation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe Santa Maria Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

The Livelink system operates through the Facility's computer network and is accessible from many computer terminals throughout the Facility.  It is the Facility's goal to make the Process Safety Information easily accessible to personnel as required by PSM and RMP.  Personnel have been trained about the basics of navigating the Livelink system, and anyone having trouble is directed to seek assistance from their supervisor or any member of the Health and Safety department.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS).

Process Safety Information is updated regularly as part of the MOC process, and procedures are updated as part of the procedure review.

PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering experience.  At a minimum, the PHA Team consists of at least three full time members:  a PHA Leader with process industry experience and training in HazOp and LOPA methodology, an Operations representative, and a Process Engineer.  Other team members are included as needed.  These members may include personnel from Maintenance, Project Managers, and Contractors. The PHA Team recommendations are reviewed and tracked using our Facility's IMPACT database system.  The appropriate Facility Engineering and Operations personnel review the recommendations from the PHA for their feasibility and impact. The Facility revalidates the Unit PHAs every five years.  The PHA revalidation process incorporates any changes that occurred in the unit during the last five years and also reviews any incidents that occurred in the unit.  The Facility PHA Coordinator maintains a list of the Units and their respective revalidation dates.  The Facility also utilizes a computer program (PHAPro) specifically programmed to document the Process Hazard Analyses.

Safe work practices are in place to ensure that potentially hazardous activities are conducted safely. These safe work practices and procedures, along with training of affected personnel and Contractors, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  Examples of safe work practices at the Santa Maria Facility include:\r\n\r\n-  Tracking and control of the entry/presence/exit of employees and contractors into and out of the Facility and process units\r\n-  A hazardous energy procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance (i.e., Lock/Tag/Try)\r\n-  A procedure for safe removal of hazardous material before process piping or equipment is opened\r\n-  A permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., Hot Work Permitting)\r\n-  A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space \r\n\r\nIn addition to the Safe Work Practices outlined above, the Santa Maria Facility conducts regular Physical Conditions Audits to ensure compliance with Federal, State, local regulations, and Company loss control requirements.

The Management of Change procedure has been implemented in order to ensure that installations and changes to equipment are made in a manner that ensures safety and operability.  Personnel and Organizational Changes that could impact Health and Safety program effectiveness are also managed through the MOC process. Whenever equipment or installations are modified, new facilities are added, or process changes are necessary, a review by appropriate Engineering, Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Environmental personnel is conducted.  For all changes, a Management of Change proposal is submitted for consideration through the KMS Resolution Tracker database system. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other Facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being placed into service. Changes are reviewed to:\r\n\r\n-  Ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\r\n-  Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change\r\n\r\nProjects proceed from the initial MOC proposal through a planned sequence of signoffs designed to ensure that affected parties are aware of the changes being implemented.  Affected Process Safety Information, including chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, is updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  Prior to startup, the MOC procedure requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) described above.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are available to employees (and contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Investigations of serious incidents include Management, Engineering, Operations, and Health & Safety staff as appropriate.

The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) describes the organization, procedures, and equipment for an emergency response. The Facility is prepared to respond to emergencies internally, with support from outside authorities if needed. The Facility's Emergency Response Team (ERT) responds to all Facility emergency incidents.  If Initial Response personnel cannot mitigate the incident, an Advanced Response is implemented utilizing additional Facility personnel and external assistance.  Emergencies requiring response by the Facility include:\r\n\r\n-  Fire or potential fire\r\n-  Gas or Oil Release\r\n-  Serious injury/illness\r\n-  Release of toxic chemical\r\n-  Emergency requiring search and rescue\r\n\r\nThe Facility has prepared for onsite emergencies through a variety of training drills and procedures.
