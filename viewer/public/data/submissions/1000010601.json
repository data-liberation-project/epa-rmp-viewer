The facility has gone under seven expansions in the past four years and now additionally processes flavored milks and meal replacement drinks.\n The main plant encompasses approximately 350,000 square feet and is positioned in a remote area of Southwest Missouri. Jasper Products does not store any regulated chemicals above the threshold limit with the exception of anhydrous ammonia. In an effort to mitigate any major release, JP installed two identical refrigeration systems and located them in opposite areas of the facility. \nJasper Products is in full compliance with the OSHA PSM Standard and utilizes third parties for the PHA facilitation, compliance audits and training. JP has contracted with Garden City Ammonia Program to provide training to all employees responsible for ammonia handling. In addition all employees and contractors are trained in the JP Emergency Response Plan. A minimum of one emergency drill is performed each year.\n Jasper Products also maintains an excellent relationship with the local emergency response teams including the Joplin Fire Department, LEPC and a third party Hazardous Material Response Company. JP has a modern state of the art security and emergency response and ammonia detection system. Both fixed systems and portable ammonia detection equipment is made available to our trained responders. \nIn 2004 Jasper Products received the top honor from the International Dairy Foods Association as having the best overall safety performance for any Dairy processor in the United States. JP has also received several awards from our Insurance carriers and their Loss Control team.   JP employees achieved 1,000,000 hours without a lost time injury on March 19th 2004. \nIt is the policy of Jasper Products to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environ"
