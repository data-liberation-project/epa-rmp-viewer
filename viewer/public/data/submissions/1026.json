This site is located in Marion County near the city of Avinger, TX. The facility has 34 full time employees.\n\nSouthwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) is an investor-owned utility. The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility is a three-unit steam electric power station with a total generation of approximately 800 mw.  It burns natural gas as the primary fuel. Units 2 and 3, rated at 323 mw each, were installed in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Unit 1, rated at 160 mw was installed in 1964. All three units have General Electric turbines.  One Combustion Engineering and two Babcock and Wilcox boilers provide steam.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the SWEPCO Wilkes Power Station.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Wilkes Power Station has been producing electricity for over 35 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surroundin"

      "SummaryText": "g community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community based upon extreme conditions defined by the governing agency, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (May 1996). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems is operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do allow a complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Wilkes Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 7.4 miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Wilkes Power Satation involves 33 pounds of chlorine released in 60 minutes from a <-inch pigtail or similar connection. The resulting cloud extends 0.68 miles down wind.\n\nSWEPCO chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n7 Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering requirements\n7 Automatic shut-off devices\n7 Interlocks a"
