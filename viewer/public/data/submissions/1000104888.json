Activation of this Emergency Response Plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system. All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post. A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed.\nAll Channelview CDU employees are provided a copy of the Emergency Response Plan when initially hired. In addition, all CDU operators have had the appropriate emergency response training as required by the OSHA standard. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nDiligent compliance with the Risk Management Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at Channelview CDU. Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows: We are in the process to implement a new muster point badging process to allow us to quickly determine any unaccounted-for employees or contractors upon a facility evacuation.\nHartree has recently employed a full-time training coordinator who will be working with new hire and current employees to ensure consistent training at all experience levels.  All employees will begin the process of not only being qualified for their current position but will be trained on other positions within the facility."

All products are stored on-site until the LPG can be loaded onto trucks, naphtha sent out by pipeline or barge, and other products being loaded onto barges. We have communicated the potential LPG releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Harris County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe facility complies with the USEPA\u2019s Risk Management Program and the OSHA PSM. Process safety information is readily available to all affected employees. Channelview CDU keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. The Channelview CDU policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, the trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Employees who enter the Channelview CDU facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational and release prevention training.
