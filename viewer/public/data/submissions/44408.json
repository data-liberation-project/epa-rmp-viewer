We train them annually in a classroom setting and on the jobsite. They are regularly evaluated. We check that all of the proper procedures are being followed and that personal protective gear is in place. Our equipment is user-friendly to help reduce the chances of operator error. Our tank is maintained exceptionally well. We are meticulous about keeping the equipment safe and in excellent repair. Because of the increased theft of Anhydrous Ammonia in recent years, we have installed valve locks to help deter theft and accidental releases. We are in close contact with the proper Emergency Response agencies. We annually report to the State Emergency Response Comission, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and our local fire department. We have also worked with our local fire department in their exercises and education in responding to Anhydrous Ammonia emergencies."
