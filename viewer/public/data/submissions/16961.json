When application begins for anhydrous ammonia, the nurse tanks are checked daily.  When in use, they are filled and are returned to the facility and checked before being refilled again.  Any minor discrepancies are corrected on the spot as they are noted.  For major discrepancies, nurse tanks are taken out of service and positioned in a designated area until time permits an employee to fix the problem.\n\nThe few personnel that does work with anhydrous ammonia has worked with it for years.  They are familiar with the operation of the transferring of products from the holding tanks to the nurse tanks as well as the maintenance procedures.\n\nThe corrosion that was listed is the hazard review section, under the major hazards identified is in regards to the nurse tanks which needs to be painted due to corrosion.  All the nurse tanks are scheduled to be repainted this summer and be completed before September 15, 1999.\n\nThere is no mitigation system in use since the location of anhydrous ammonia is located in the open on the southwest corner of the property.  Any release of the product would go up into atmosphere as a gas release.",

      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Whitehouse Grain Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  We also do custom spraying of chemicals for our customers as another service.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for farmers.  The maximum quantity stored on site would be 200,000 pounds in our two storage tanks; which the largest is a 30,000 gallon tank and the smaller tank is 18,000 gallon.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a holding tank released as a gas over 10 (ten) minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.48 miles; based upon a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .32 miles. \n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safe"

The five year accident history.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility.  Nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38, and a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nThe plan includes employees to shut-off the appropriate values to stop any small accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Otherwise, the fire department would be notified and full cooperation would be given to them to take the necessary steps to contain, stop the leak, and determine if we need to implement steps to evacuate the area or shelter in place.  \n\n7.  Planned change to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time.\n\n8.  Other\n\nThe latitude and longitude location description code was entered as other.
