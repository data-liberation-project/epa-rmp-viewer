              "Description": "The Propylene Concentrator Unit (PCU) is scheduled for mechanical completion and start-up during the third quarter of 2000. Although management systems for all necessary  prevention program elements are in place, several of them, such as Compliance Audit, Incident Investigation, and Management of Change, have not been utilized within the confines of the PCU.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information, *  Process hazard analysis, *  Operating procedures, *  Training, *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change, *  Pre-Startup Safety review, *  Compliance audits, *  Incident investigation, *  Employee participation, *  Hot work permit, *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have a multitude of programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operations of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies as well as train in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program which include all of the above listed areas.   All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique. \n\n We have an ongoing inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.  \n\nThe Operations personnel make regular walk through inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If anything out of the ordinary is found, it is repaired by the observer or reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.",

We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operations of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies as well as train in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program which include all of the above listed areas.   All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique. \n\n We have an ongoing inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.  \n\nThe Operations personnel make regular walk through inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.

The products are ethane, propane,\npropylene, isobutane, normal butane and Natural Gasoline using a small variety of chemicals and fractionation processing\noperations.  The facility is an integrated complex divided up into different operating units identified as the ACT Frac Unit\nand the Propylene Concentrator Unit (PCU).

The process units operated by Enterprise involve the processing of liquefied petroleum \ngases (LPG) into their individual components such as ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  \nThe primary separation process utilized is fractionation by distillation.  Supplemental fired heat recovery units provide heat energy \nto the processes via a heat medium system.  A gas turbine is utilized to drive a refrigeration compressor while recovering the \nheated exhaust gases in one of the fired heat recovery units.  The facility utilizes an air assisted flare for any and all venting of the \nprocesses.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site\nconsequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nEthane is a finished product at the Port Allen facility.

The total release would be approximately \n616,000 pounds. The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would be approximately 0.69 miles.  This scenario would \nnot be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community \nwould be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All ERT protocols would be in effect.  The offsite consequence will not affect any\nof the residential population. There would be no off site environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on\nsite.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4\" bleed valve sheared from the Propylene Splitter tower.  The material\nreleased would be a propylene/propane mix and would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The total release would be 10,400\npounds at a rate of 1,040 lbs/minute f"
