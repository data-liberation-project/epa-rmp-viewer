      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms California conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\n\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\n\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms California uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in Appendix 8.1 show the facility location map and site plan.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in product storage cooling, product precooling (vacuum cooling), and water chilling operations. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the largest single system is above 10,000 lb, which exceeds the federal TQ. There are four (4) separate refrigeration systems at the facility. These processes are the Main System (T1, T2, and T3) and three (3) half-car (12-Pallet) Vacuum Tube Systems (R-0401 & T-0401, R-1102 & T-1102, and R-1202 & T-1202). The Main System is the only syste"

In addition to these four (4) systems, the facility operates additional vacuum cooling systems, which are leased from the Western Precooling Systems (WPS). The WPS is responsible for the maintenance of this refrigeration system. This process is covered under a different facility RMP (Western Precooling Systems - Yuma Shop, Facility EPA ID: 100000122119). Therefore, it is not covered under this RMP.\n\n\n\nMain System: The largest system is the Main System that serves the Cold Storage Warehouses, Falling Film Water Chillers, and Plate Frame Heat Exchangers. Main System is composed of fixed and portable equipment. Fixed equipment includes evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators, plate frame type water chillers w/ surge drums on top, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable equipment includes screw & reciprocating type compressor skids, falling film water chillers and two refrigeration trailers (R-0613 & R-0816). Main System is operated seasonally from November to April. The ammonia charge of the Main System is approximately 43,650 lbs.\n\n\n\nVacuum Cooling Systems: Each vacuum cooling system is composed of a half-car (12-pallet) vacuum tube and a refrigeration trailer containing reciprocating compressors, evaporative condenser, high- and low-pressure receivers, oil pot, ammonia pump, and vacuum pumps.\n\n\n\nVacuum cooling systems operate as standalone systems while high-side refrigeration trailers (R-0613 & R-0816) and falling film water chillers operate connected to the main system. At the end of the season, all three vacuum cooling systems will be pumped down to onsite nurse and the falling film water chillers, one of the refrigeration trailers (R-0816), and vacuum cooling systems ships to Salinas, CA facility for summer operations, from April to November.\n\n\n\nThe total quantit"

All pressure vessels and the compressor are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. All low side vessels that are connected directly to the suction of compressor is installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressor upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming.\n\n\n\nUpdated refrigeration drawings are located in Appendix 8.1-Refrigeration System Drawings. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix 12.1, describe equipment details.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for each system is described in Chapter 8.3.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms California personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Chapter 20. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Chapter 0.0. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, priority level and implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\n\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.
