Policies and procedures are in-place to assist the staff with compliance with applicable hazardous materials rules and regulations. The Process Safety Management (PSM) Team at the facility is responsible to ensure appropriate procedures and safety measures are in-place to protect our employees and the surrounding community. The PSM Team is comprised of the Distribution Center Director, Maintenance Manager and Safety Coordinator with outside assistance from the Senior Director Facility Services Engineer, Corporate Environmental, Health & Safety Manager and the outside refrigeration contractor.\n\n\n\n    The facility is located in an industrial/commercial park east northeast of Washington D.C. in the Greater Landover metro area. The facility consists of a warehouse house/distribution center for dry and refrigerated grocery products. The main warehousing facility is approximately 460,000 square feet of which approximately 25 percent is refrigerated space. The area around the facility consists of some commercial/industrial businesses and residences. The terrain is mostly flat. The facility is bounded on the south by Sheriff Road and a residential area; a small creek is located to the east and commercial/industrial business reside on three sides to the east, north and west.\n\n    \n\n    MDV Landover receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to military commissaries in the Northeastern United States. Grocery products include dry goods, frozen products as well as meat and other perishable items. Truck maintenance activities are performed by outside contractors off of the premises. The facility is connected to city water and sewer services.\n\n    \n\n    Hours of operation are up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Personnel at the facility include a distribution center direc"

Headcount at the facility is approximately 95 associates.\n\n\n\nPart of the facility is a cold storage warehouse for the storage of frozen and perishable food products. The refrigeration for this part of the facility is provided by an ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia system contains approximately 9,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. In this system, ammonia is the heat transfer medium that is compressed, cooled through the use of evaporative condensers and distributed to cooling evaporators throughout the ammonia refrigerated parts of the facility to maintain appropriate temperatures for the products stored in each area.\n\n\n\nBecause of the use of hazardous materials on-site, the facility is regulated by federal and state hazardous material rules and regulations. The ammonia as well as the lead and sulfuric acid (used in powered industrial truck batteries) are regulated under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. Risk Management Plans (RMP) are required under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68). \n\n\n\nFrom an occupational safety and health perspective the facility has developed a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan which is required for locations exceeding the 10,000 pound threshold for ammonia. Since this location is slightly under that threshold, the PSM Plan has been completed on a voluntary basis. Other OSHA rules such as lockout tagout, fall protection, confined space; powered industrial trucks, etc. also apply to the facility. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the process presenting the most risk to our employees and the surrounding community. Safe guards in the form of computer control systems employing sensors and interlocks to shutdown the system in the event of an equipment malfunction or release of ammonia are built into the system. Alarm sensors are placed within the ammonia engine room (processing cen"

Detailed emergency plans and procedures are in-place to warn our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nSince this is the initial start-up of the ammonia refrigeration system, there have been no ammonia releases from the facility. Incident investigation procedures are in-place to ensure any potential future release is thoroughly investigated to determine the \"root cause\" of the incident and to ensure appropriate corrective action is implemented quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a detailed emergency response program to handle fire, ammonia releases or natural disasters. All employees receive training during new hire orientation sessions and periodic refresher training to ensure they understand the facility emergency response procedures. Attachments to Part 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan provide detailed coverage of potential ammonia release scenarios and the appropriate actions in response to those scenarios. In the event of an ammonia release, the employees are provided information over the facility public address system as to the nature of the release and instructions where they should assemble. Given the safety hazards of ammonia, the safest place maybe within the facility; if evacuation is necessary, the employees are given directions to the appropriate outdoor assembly point based on the direction of the wind. Evacuation drills are periodically held to ensure the employees are familiar with the emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nAll rescues and emergency response activities are handled by the local Fire Department. MDV Landover employees are not trained to respond to ammonia releases and are instructed to evacuate from the affected areas and leave emergency response to the local authorities. The fire department periodically visits the facility to ensure they are familiar with the physical structure and the hazards "
