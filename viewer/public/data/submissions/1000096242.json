This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia storage and handling system. NVAS policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe address for NVAS is listed as 4936 Bell Rd, Chico, California 95973. The regulated substances managed at the facility is 20% aqueous ammonia. Including administrative controls, the \"maximum intended inventory\" is approximately 106,120 pounds (lb.). It is stored in a vertical storage vessel at ambient temperature in liquid form. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by NVAS to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia. Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of 20% aqueous ammonia is 106,120 lbs. The amount of anhydrous ammonia within the solution is 21,224 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 10,000 lb. threshold for the EPA Risk Management Program. As a result, the aqueous ammonia covered process is subject to EPA RMP Program Level 2 requirements. The Prevention Program 2 elements include:\n\n?    Safety Information\n\n?    Hazard Review\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Maintenance\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNVAS has had no releases in the last five years that meet the five-year accident history reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nNVAS is a non-responding facility and does not train employees for active responses to ammonia releases.

      "SummaryText": "facility will rely upon the local emergency hazardous materials response team and the CDF, and Butte County Fire Department for responses to uncontrolled releases of aqueous ammonia. In accordance with 19 CCR ?2765.1, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan in place. However, it is required to have appropriate mechanisms in place for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response. These mechanisms are described below. \n\nThe facility has procedures in-place to evacuate the facility and notify responders when there is a need for a response. A current copy of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) can be found with the Regulatory Coordinator and within the Emergency Planning and Response tab of the Compliance Workbook. The EAP includes:\n\n?    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n\n?    Evacuation Procedures\n\n?    Safety and Health Considerations\n\n?    Notification Procedures\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. These studies include the following: Hazard Review, Seismic Assessment and Hazard Assessment. Any outstanding recommendations form these studies will have been addressed by October 2023."
