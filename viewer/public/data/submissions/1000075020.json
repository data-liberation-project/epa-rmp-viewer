Pasadena Plant is located on 2.5 acres within the LyondellBasell Bayport Chemical complex on the SE-side of the city of Pasadena, Harris County, Texas. The property is bounded on the north by vacant rural land, on the west by Underwood Road, on the south and the east by the LyondellBasell Bayport Chemical complex. \n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\n\n\nSolvay's Pasadena plant is committed to conducting its business in a responsible manner, in the best interest of our stakeholders, including our employees, neighbors, visitors, contractors, customers, the public and the environment. This policy is consistent with our Corporate Policy. Through this policy, the employees of the Pasadena facility uphold the commitment to comply with all applicable HSSE rules and regulations, corporate policy & requirements as well as the commitment to the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care&reg; Program and continuous improvements in the site HSSE management system. The Solvay Pasadena facility is also committed to comply with the American Chemistry Council's Process Safety Code, which is one of 3 sets of Codes under the umbrella of the ACC's Integrated Responsible Care Management System. Solvay believes in ownership of work processes by every employee. Accordingly, we believe it is the responsibility of every Pasadena employee to work safely and to maintain high standards in Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Affairs in all aspects of our operations. \n\n\n\nThe Solvay Pasadena site is required to comply with Solvay's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Solvay's PSM program meets the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program as detailed in 29 CFR 1910.119 & EPA's Risk Management Program as detailed in 40 CFR 68.\n\nSolvay's PSM program comprises the following 14 elements:\n\n\n"

Propylene Oxide, the only RMP-listed chemical stored on the plant site. It is stored in a 30,000-gallon steel storage tank that is mounded with concrete for enhanced safety. Propylene Oxide is delivered to the site by tank-truck.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Propylene Oxide, the Pasadena Plant uses other non-regulated chemicals in its processes to manufacture a variety of surfactants & intermediates that are supplied to a number of different manufacturing industries which include, but are not limited to, the following:  agricultural chemicals, coatings, oil field chemicals, and personal care products.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PROPYLENE OXIDE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nManagement at the Pasadena Plant is committed to utilizing the 14 elements of Solvay's PSM program to mitigate the potential for process incidents. In addition, all plant employees receive training on all 14 elements, and their participation is required in every aspect of the Process Safety Management program on site. All Plant personnel have also been trained on Solvay's Life-Saving Rules and Life-Critical Safety Procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Pasadena Plant conducts periodic self-assessments (audits) to evaluate compliance with the OSHA-PSM & EPA-RMP program requirements, and develops action plans to ensure timely correction to any d"
