      "SummaryText": "The industry ALBERTO CULVER (PR) INC is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety. It is their policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated \nsubstances. The industry' primary activities are Health and Beauty products. The regulated process involve\nthe manufacture of hair mousses and feminine deodorant spray. Isobutane and Dymel are used as \ndispersants for the products. \n\nThe industry has two regulated substances, both flammables: A-31 Isobutane (Propane, 2 methyl) and Dymel\n(mixture of isobutane, propane and difluoroethane). They also have LPG cylinders. The regulated substances\nare flammables used in the process. The LPG is used to fuel a flare control system for the process. There \nare two storage tanks of 18,000 gallons each to store Isobutane and Dymel. Only one tank is used at a time \nfor the process. A maximum of 6-239 lbs of LPG cylinders are stored in the facility, with one LPG cylinder\nin line with the flare's pilot flame. In February 2003, the propellant used in the manufacture (A-46, a mixture \nof Isobutane and Propane) was changed to Dymel. Isobutane is used for the manufacture of FDS, feminine\ndeodorant spray.\n\nResults of the Offsite consequence analysis are included as part of the requirements of this form. The facility\nis subject to OSHA PSM and so it qualifies for Program 3 processes It is also in compliance with OSHA PSM. \nRule. Although the propellants were changed and the results for the scenarios were the same as before, the \nPHA and all the PHA requisites were updated. Back-up systems were revised and some additional ones \n(portable OVA analyzer) were recommended, operating procedures were updated, training was updated, \nand maintenance procedures were revised.\n\nThere has not been any accidental release in the last five years previous to the submission of this RMP that\nhas resulted in serious onsite or offsite impacts.\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan. It is in compliance wi"

An Emergency Response Plan was \nprepared for the facility to comply with Program 3 processes and will be fully implemented in the next months.\nTraining has been updated and drills with the local Fire Department will be coordinated.\n\nChanges have been planned to improve safety. Some of these are: the use of a portable OVA analyzer in \ndaily inspections made to transfer lines and during loading/unloading of propellants, update training program\nand schedule, coordinate drills with local Fire Department and update operating procedures."
