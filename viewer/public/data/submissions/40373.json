Policy dictates that Garniers WWTF personnel continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the policy and compliance manuals, which are available to all employees.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe County of Okaloosa operates the Garniers WWTF located at 714 Essex Road in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.  At the treatment plant, the facility stores approximately eight (8) one-ton cylinders and a maximum of fifty (50) one hundred-fifty pound cylinders of chlorine.  The one-ton cylinders are used on-site as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater.  The one hundred-fifty pound cylinders are not used on site, but are used at other facilities operated by the County.  The one-ton cylinders and the one hundred-fifty pound cylinders are stored in separate areas at the facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Garniers WWTF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A process hazard analysis was conducted at this facility using a \"what-if\" analysis.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe Garniers WWTF has not had an accidental release in the last five (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event a significant releases occurs, the Okaloosa County Department of Emergency Services would be notified immediately to respond.
