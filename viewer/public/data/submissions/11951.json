Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant are strongly committed to associate, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass finishing textile fabrics.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The chlorine is used for water and wastewater dechlorination while the sulfur dioxide is used for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 10,000 pounds while sulfur dioxide is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 8,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from the wastewater treatment plant.  In this scenario 6000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid  released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated toevaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 55% due to passive mitigation.  At"

A PHA/update was conducted on 05/28/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations,  emergency shutdown, emergency operations,normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that associates who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and  pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel  are offered specialized training as needed..  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The must recent review/revision of maintenance procedures will be performed on 08/25/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel  or any other associate whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered trai"

These reviews will be conducted to confrim that construction, equipment, operating  and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine wheter the provision set out under both PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  A compliance audit is scheduled for 08/25/1999.  These audits will be carried out a least every three years and any corrective action required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nAssociate Participation\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Associates familiar with the processes involved participate in the committee that develops and implements these programs.   In addition, our associates have access to  all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
