[DCPC] is strongly committed to environmental compliance and employee and public safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program encompasses areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  DCPC implements appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nDCPC is a leading manufacturer of aerosol propellants and refrigerant gases.  The facility receives chemicals in tank trucks and rail cars that are offloaded into various storage tanks.  The chemicals are processed through molecular sieve columns, if necessary, to higher purity levels and specifications.  Chemicals are metered and blended to customer specifications, if required.  Outbound shipments are sent via tank trucks or ISO tank containers.\r\n\r\nThe following 3 regulated [flammables] chemicals are present at the Sebring, Florida facility: \r\nPropane, n-Butane and Isobutane.\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 and various applicable Recognized and Generally Acceptable Good Engineering Practices [RAGAGEP].  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDCPC maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe plan follows the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38 and 40 CFR Part 68.90, including evacuations and notification of federal, state and local emergency response agencies.  The facility Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated and verified with the Central Florida Local Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC] and the Desoto City Fire Department."

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the plant, DCPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDCPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nDCPC conducts maintenance checks on process equipment which includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified and trained personnel.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training, as needed.  Deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications are conducted routinely.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that cons"

It is conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and a report of the findings of the audit is developed and documented, noting deficiencies that have been corrected. The two most recent compliance audit reports are kept on file.\r\n \r\nIncident Investigation\r\nDCPC has robust incident investigation procedures in place for events that result in, or has the potential for a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations would identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent future recurrence.  Policies are in place for all reports to be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nDCPC has developed a written plan of action to implement the employee participation required by PSM. DCPC consults with employees on the conduct and development of process hazard analyses and on the development of the other elements of process management.  Employees have access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required to be developed under the PSM standard.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nDCPC occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selection, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  DCPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency events.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Sebring, FL plant is a new facility.  Other DCPC facilities nationwide have maintained an excellent record of no accidental releases over the past"
