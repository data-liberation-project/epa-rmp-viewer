The Plant's Hot Work Permit procedure addresses:  General requirements; The Hot Work Permit; Authorization of hot work; Fire prevention precautions; and Fire watchers.\n\nManagement of Change - The purpose of the Plant's Management of Change procedure is to establish the Plant's requirements for managing changes to processes that handle chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  This procedure provides direction in identifying, reviewing, and authorizing process changes prior to their implementation in order to minimize their potential impact on safety and health.

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant (PARWQCP) are committed to operating the Plant with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, PARWQCP has designed and implemented a management system that integrates the elements of Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, T8 CCR \u00a75189, EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, T19 CCR Div. 2, Ch. 4.5.  The policies and procedures integrated under PARWQCP's management system specifically address prevention of the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, and emergency response to an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at PARWQCP\n\nThe Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant, located on San Francisco Bay in northeastern Palo Alto, receives and treats wastewater from Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, East Palo Alto, and Stanford University.  The Plant processes 25-30 million gallons of domestic and industrial wastewater per day.  The Plant provides primary and secondary treatment, final filtration, and disinfection.\n\nPrimary treatment removes scum and sludge from the wastewater influent.  The primary settling tanks allow particulate matter to settle out or float to the surface and be removed from the flow.\n\nSecondary treatment begins with BOD removal in aerobic, fixed-film reactors.  Aerobic aeration basins, with a retention time of 5 hours, are used to convert ammonia to nitrogen and nitrates.  From the aeration basins, the water moves into the secondary clarifiers, where settled activated sludge is removed.\n\nFinal filtration removes most of the oil, grease, and suspended solids from the secondary effluent.  The filtered"

      "SummaryText": "water then flows through several chlorine disinfection steps and final dechlorination before being discharged into San Francisco Bay or diverted to the Reclamation Facility.\n\nThe water discharged into the San Francisco Bay is frequently tested to confirm that the water is not harmful to wildlife.  In order to protect San Francisco Bay from the harmful effect of toxic substances such as heavy metals, PARWQCP requires residents, businesses, and institutions to reduce the amounts of these substances they release into the sewer.  The first metal targeted for reduction was silver, which is toxic to wildlife and has accumulated in clams in San Francisco Bay.  The Plant's discharge of metals into the Bay was reduced by 60 percent during the 1980's, as a result of the Industrial Waste Control Program and enhanced treatment at the PARWQCP.\n\nThere are two processes at PARWQCP which are subject to the RMP rule (as well as the CalARP program and the PSM standard):  the Chlorination process, and the Dechlorination process.\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance handled in the Chlorination process.  Chlorine is used in the Chlorination process as a disinfectant.  Disinfection entails the destruction of pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses.  Chlorine acts as an oxidizer on pathogens, organic compounds, and reduced nitrogen compounds.  Typically, wastewater disinfection requires 40 to 60 grams of chlorine per cubic meter (about 264 gallons) of wastewater.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the Plant by tank truck.  The tank truck capacity is 18 tons.  The chlorine truck is connected to the chlorine unloading manifold with braided-steel, flexible hoses.\n\nThe Plant's chlorine bulk tank has a capacity of 25 tons.  The tank is constructed of steel.  The valves are identical to the valves on a chlorine railcar.  The liquid and gas lines are equipped with excess flow valves that limit the flow rate out of the chlorine bulk tank to a maximum of 7000 pounds per hour.  If chlorine i"

Chlorine vapor is removed from the chlorine storage room and routed to the chlorine contact tank, where it is consumed in the chlorination reactions.  Two additional eductors within the chlorine building can be activated manually.  The eductors are capable of removing 21,000 pounds of chlorine per day.\n\nTon containers of chlorine are kept on standby, for use in the event of bulk chlorine unavailability.  The maximum amount of chlorine handled on-site (in bulk storage and ton containers) at any time is 74,000 pounds.\n\nChlorine vapor is metered through chlorinators on vacuum demand.  Each chlorinator consists of a vacuum regulator, a flow meter, a control valve, and a differential pressure regulator.  Downstream of the vacuum regulator, chlorine gas is handled at a pressure that is less than atmospheric.  A leak downstream of the vacuum regulator would result in air intrusion, rather than a chlorine release.  On loss of vacuum, or on loss of chlorine supply pressure, the vacuum regulator closes.\n\nVacuum is generated by eductors (also referred to as ejectors).  In the eductors, chlorine is mixed with water.  The resulting solution is mixed with process water for treatment.  The vapor pressure of the chlorine solution is low enough that the solution does not pose a significant risk upon release.\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas at ambient temperature.  It has an intensely irritating odor, and is moderately toxic by inhalation.  Chlorine vapor is denser than air.  Chlorine is not flammable, although it will support combustion as an oxidizer.  Chlorine is only slightly soluble in water.  When chlorine reacts with water, a weak solution of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids is formed.  These acids are corrosive to most common metals.  Chlorine reacts with many organic compounds to form chlorinated derivatives.  Hydrogen chloride is often formed as a by-product of these reactions.\n\nSulfur"
