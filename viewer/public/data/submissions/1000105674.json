When process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Perryville Electric Generating Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operations demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.  Annual refresher training is given as Computer-Based Training (CBTs) in \"My Learning\" program.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  Procedures for issuing a hot work permit are clearly outlined in the Safety Manual.  The Perryville Electric Generating Plant provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in operations and maintenance for a period of one year following completion of work.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, outage, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practice necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) have received and understood the training required, (3) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (4) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (5) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a chan"

Towards the northwest of the facility, there was substantial development of a residential community. It was estimated that 150 additional homes were constructed since 2010 within the impact area of the worst case toxic release. Therefore, the impacted population was increased by 450 to account for residents in these nearby communities. The total impacted population was estimated to be 2750 for the worst case toxic release. \n\nUpdated  Population impacted by Alternate Case Toxic Release: \nSince MARPLOT uses census data from 2010, the area impacted by the alternate case toxic release was reviewed to determine significant changes in residential development since 2010. Towards the northwest of the facility, there was substantial development of a residential community. It was estimated that 1 additional home was constructed since 2010 within the impact area of the alternate case toxic release. Therefore, the impacted population was increased by 3 to account for residents in these homes. The total impacted population was estimated to be 6 for the alternate case toxic release. \n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant is committed to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.

As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria in the Accident Release Program (ARP), the Perryville Electric Generating Plant is a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were or would be present in the planned process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  There is one anhydrous ammonia tank at the facility.  The identification of a vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nELL identified one regulated toxic substance and no flammable substances above the threshold values at Perryville Electric Generating Plant.  The anhydrous ammonia tank with a capacity of 5,370 gallons was determined to exceed the threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates the Perryville Electric Generating Plant is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLocal Emergency Response Coordination\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nELL and the Perryville Electric Generating Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.

This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as, key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant uses a combination of what if checklists and a hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  These methods use a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Perryville Electric Generating Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operation, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Perryville Electric Generating Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operation, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following an outage or after an emergency shutdown.
