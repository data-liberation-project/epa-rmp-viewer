The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is more of a possible release scenario that could occur compared to the worst-case release scenario.  Based on the process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine system, an alternative release scenario was selected.  Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The scenario used for chlorine was a leak from a connecting pipe leading from the tank to the feed manifold. \n\nAs with the worst-case scenario, the building mitigation was considered. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 0.018 kg/s. The same modeling approach was used as for the worst case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more common conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 78 degrees F, and average humidity of 50%. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative release scenario indicates that this scenario has an offsite impact.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have cause safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Quarles WTP during the last five years.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Quarles Water Treatment Plant (WTP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses.  Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do take providing the environment safe disinfected water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  Please feel free to contact A. Roy Fowler III at 770-426-8788 if you have any questions.\n\nPolicy Statement\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of CCMWA to operate the Quarles WTP safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the chlorine system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  Safe operation depends upon proper storage of chlorine, proper handling of the chlorination system, and inherent safety features in the design of the chlorination system. \nThe Quarles WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the Risk Management Program Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\nThis policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Quarles WTP.

The Quarles WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers. The Quarles WTP facility has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Quarles WTP facility, operating since 1953, is located in Cobb County, Georgia. The primary activity at the Quarles WTP is municipal water treatment, including chlorination of water for taste and odor control.  The Quarles WTP has a present capacity of 64 million gallons  per day (MGD). The sludge lime by-product from the facility is applied to farm land.\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine in sixteen one-ton steel storage cylinders. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP Rule. Some of the chlorine is used to generate chlorine dioxide, which is used as it is generated, and is not present in the process in amounts greater than the threshold quantity in the RMP Rule.\n\nA chlorine leak detector monitor continuously checks for leaks in the cylinder storage area and in the chlorinator room.  The facility also has additional alarms for process control. These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine central control panel at the Quarles WTP. \n\nBoth the cylinder storage area and the chlorinator room are enclosed in a building.  The building is equipped with a manually operated ventilation system.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the building along with smoke alarms.  \n\nOf"

      "SummaryText": "fsite Consequence Analysis Result\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as worst case and alternative release scenarios. The worst-case scenario requires that that single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for off-site impacts from chlorine.  An alternative release scenario is also required for chlorine. \n \nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nOnly passive or administrative controls are allowed under the worst-case scenario to reduce off-site impacts.  As required by the RMP Rule, the worst-case scenario used for the Quarles WTP is the rupture of one chlorine cylinder with a maximum capacity of 1 ton, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration. The chlorine cylinder storage area is in an enclosed building, which results in a passive mitigation of any chlorine release. The release rate reduction from the enclosed building is approximately 55 percent of the release rate from the cylinder, per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiencies levels for buildings storing chlorine.  The release rate will, accordingly, be 0.83 kg/s. \nThe cylinder rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake.  The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA-approved  model DEGADIS 2.1.  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency respond planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice this type of total release of a cylinder would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA was 3 ppm.  In addition all required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions-Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per sec"
