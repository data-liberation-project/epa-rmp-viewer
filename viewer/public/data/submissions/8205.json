      "SummaryText": "The following  executive summary has been prepared for the Kaskaskia Water District Water Treatment Plant located in the City of New Athens, St. Clair County, Illinois. The Kaskaskia Water District (KWD) has recently introduced more stringent chemical safety policies and an updated Emergency Response Plan for the accidental release of chlorine from this facility. The chlorination process utilizes a vacuum feed system which was changed from a pressure feed system in June 1993. Chlorine leak detectors along with visible and audible alarms were also updated in 1993. KWD is a water treatment facility which provides treated water to many customers in St. Clair Co., Washington Co., and Randolph Co. in Illinois. KWD treats raw water pumped from the Kaskaskia River with various chemicals including chlorine, however, only chlorine exceeds the EPA RMP threshold quantity. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the facility is 6,000 pounds but average quantity of chlorine on-site is 3,500 pounds. A worst case scenario and alternative scenario have been developed for this facility using EPA and AWWA guidance. The worst case scenario for this facility considers a catastrophic chlorine gas release of 2,000 pounds at a release rate of 200 pounds/minute for a ten minute release duration which results in a distance to endpoint of 2.6 miles. This worst case scenario is estimated to affect 2,500 people along with part of the Kaskaskia River State Fish and Wildlife Area. The chlorine storage and feed rooms in this facility are separate and enclosed which may reduce the effect of release on the surrounding community. The alternative release scenario for this facility considers a toxic gas release from a horizontal 1-ton chlorine container due to a tubing failure, bad connection or valve failure. This scenario models a release of 317 pounds of toxic gas at a release rate of 10.5 pounds/minute over a 60 minute release duration resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.48 miles. This sc"

The passive mitigation system applicable to this facility is an enclosure since the chlorine rooms are isolated and enclosed.\n\nThe KWD WTP  is operated by an experienced work force who are knowledgeable of the chlorination process at their facility. The chlorination process is visually inspected daily as part of the plant start-up procedure. The chlorination process includes process controls such as check valves and alarms which are designed to limit the release of chlorine in the event of an accident or equipment failure. The detection systems in the chlorine storage and chlorine feed rooms are designed to trigger an audible and visual alarm within the plant to alert the employees. The alarm is tested daily as part of the plant's start-up procedure.\n\nThe KWD WTP is fortunate as to not having experienced an accidental release of chlorine within the last five years. The facility feels that the absence of accidental releases is due to the daily inspection of the chlorination process and preventative maintenance procedures in place.\n\nAlthough the WTP has not had an accidental release within the last five years, they have an Emergency Response Plan in place to deal with an emergency should one arise. The Plant's ERP includes a list of authorized personnel that have access to the facility and should be notified in the event of a chlorine release. Also included is a plan of action to be taken in the event of a chlorine leak. The plan of action  includes instructions on how to contain the leak at different areas in the chlorination process. The plan includes a floor plan of the water plant indicating the location of the chlorine storage and feed rooms as well as a diagram of the chlorine storage and feed rooms, illustrating valves in the chlorination process that could be used to contain a chlorine leak.\n\nThe KWD WTP has recently initiated a training program for t"

Employees are trained monthly in the use of the SCBA. The plant has coordinated with the St. Clair Co. ESDA, New Athens Fire Department, and the New Athens LEPC by providing each agency with a copy of the Emergency Response Plan for the facility. The KWD WTP also plans to coordinate with the afore mentioned agencies to train employees and emergency responders how to repair a leaking 1-ton chlorine container. This training will use a  mock 1-ton chlorine container along with an emergency repair kit for the 1-ton chlorine container which the plant has on site. This training is currently underway.\n\nThe Kaskaskia Water District Water Treatment Plant is committed to providing a water treatment facility which can aquedately serve it's customers with safe drinking water as well as providing it's employees safe working conditions. Also with the coordination of local agencies, the implementation of the Emergency Response Plan, and the training of it's employees in the repair of chlorine leaks, the Kaskaskia Water District Water Treatment Plant is prepared to lessen the impact of an accidental release of chlorine on the surrounding community."
