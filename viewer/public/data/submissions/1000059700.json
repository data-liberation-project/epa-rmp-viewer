The CalARP Program documents that are created pursuant to this Program are made accessible to our employees and to other affected persons in accordance with applicable requirements and the provisions of the CalARP Program and the OSHA PSM Standard.\n\n\n\nEmergency planning and response measures have been developed and implemented for proper and safe evacuation of those on site and for notifications to outside emergency responders.  These measures reflect the established policies of this facility for ensuring the health and safety of all employees and those who may be on site or in the area in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel ensure that safety and environmental policies are implemented at this facility by conducting periodic compliance inspections.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Cambria Winery is located at 5475 Chardonnay Lane, Santa Maria, California.  The winery is owned by Jackson Family Wines, which is located at 421 Aviation Boulevard, Santa Rosa, California.  The Cambria Winery refrigeration system was designed and installed by Industrial Refrigeration and Process Piping, Inc. (IRAPP) and began operation in 1988.\n\n\n\nThis facility operates one (1) anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The initial PHA was completed on June 23, 2005 by Axiom Engineers and revalidated July 8, 2011.\n\n\n\nThe plant is located approximately 15 miles east of the city of Santa Mar"

The area surrounding the facility is largely agricultural with mountainous areas to the east.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains approximately 25 full time employees on site.  The plant operates one shift most of the year, except during the grape harvest, when operation extends to 24 hours per day and additional employees are hired for the season and an additional shift is added.  \n\n\n\nThe plant is comprised of two large buildings for barrel storage and production, tank farms along the east and south, a loading dock, wastewater treatment system, parking, and the refrigeration system equipment pad.  The facility main entrance along Santa Maria Mesa Road is used by employees, visitors, contractors, truck deliveries, and shipping.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Evacuation Assembly Area is located as required for potential evacuations.  Employees are trained and drill for alarm responses and evacuations.\n\n\n\nProcess Description \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the heat transfer fluid.  The ammonia refrigeration process is a closed-loop, single-stage, mechanical refrigeration system.  The system is automatically controlled by microprocessors at the compressors, which minimize the potential for human error.\n\n\n\nWhile anhydrous ammonia is used as the primary refrigerant in the refrigeration system, glycol is used as the secondary and direct cooling medium for cooling barrel storage areas.  The system cooling configuration is flooded to ensure sufficient liquid ammonia for the glycol plate and frame heat exchanger for optimal heat exchange.  Wine tanks are cooled with direct expansion of ammonia in coils around the tanks.  The system is charged with approximately 12,790 lbs. anhydrous ammonia and is a built-up system.  \n\n\n\nFacility maintenance mechanics regularly monitor process parameters, including pressure, temperature, and vessel levels for proper operation.

An ammonia refrigeration company provides service and some preventive maintenance for the system.\n\n\n\nMost of the refrigeration equipment is located outside on the Machinery Pad along the northeast perimeter of the facility.  The Accumulator and Glycol Plate & Frame Heat Exchangers are located at the north and east corners of the Tank and Barrel Building.\n\n\n\nThe system is graphically described with Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) and operating procedures have been written for the system operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system is maintained regularly and generally complies with industry standards and the applicable codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration System Operation\n\n\n\nA.    EVAPORATIVE CONDENSER\n\n\n\nThe Evaporative Condenser receives high-pressure vapor from the refrigeration compressor(s) via the high stage discharge (HSD) line.  The condenser rejects the heat of the system (heat of compression, the refrigeration loads and connected motors) to the atmosphere by evaporation of water and fan airflow, which condenses the high pressure vapor to a high pressure liquid (HPL) and drains to the High Pressure Receiver via the condenser drain (CD) line.  The ammonia is condensed at a design pressure of 150 psig at a coincident temperature of 85?F and wet bulb temperature of 71?F.\n\n\n\nB.    HIGH PRESSURE RECEIVER\n\n\n\nThe High Pressure Receiver supplies high pressure liquid (HPL) for the glycol plate and frame heat exchangers, the wine jackets for tank cooling, and liquid injection cooling for the screw compressor.  \n\n\n\nAn equalizer line between the condenser discharge and the High-Pressure Receiver ensures that equal pressure is maintained between the two points for proper liquid draining to the Receiver.\n\n\n\nC.

The Accumulator sizing allows for adequate separation of the liquid and vapor to ensure the compressors only receive ammonia vapor.\n\n\n\nD.    SURGE DRUMS - At Heat Exchangers\n\n\n\nAccumulator vessels SD-1 and SD-2 provide liquid ammonia in a flooded configuration to the respective plate and frame glycol chiller heat exchangers.  Each surge drum is designed to operate at 20?F.  Liquid feed is provided from Accumulator LPRU-1 via the high temperature recirculated liquid (HTRL) line and a metered valve assembly.\n\n\n\nE.    HEAT EXCHANGERS (Plate & Frame)\n\n\n\nThe heat exchangers transfer heat absorbing capacity from the ammonia to glycol for subsequent barrel room cooling.  The heat exchangers are arranged in a flooded configuration, and there are no isolation valves between the Accumulator vessel and the heat exchanger.\n\n\n\nF.    HIGH STAGE COMPRESSOR PACKAGES\n\n\n\nThree (3) reciprocating compressors and one (1) screw compressor provide the required vapor compression.  The high stage refrigeration screw compressor utilizes Liquid Injection Cooling (LIC) from the High-Pressure Receiver, while the reciprocating compressors are cooled via water jackets.  The purpose of the compressors is to create a suction that will pull the low-pressure vapor from the Accumulator and to compress the vapor to a high temperature and high pressure.  The design conditions for the high stage compressors are 20?F SST, 80?F condensing.\n\n\n\nG.    OIL POTS\n\n\n\nThe oil pots provides a means of safely removing accumulated refrigerant oil from the system at the plate and frame accumulator and the recirculated pump package accumulator.  Oil travels with liquid ammonia but does not mix well.  Where the liquid tends to accumulate (such as in a vessel), the oil will separate and fall to the bottom.  The oil pot function is to collect this oil and allow it to b"

Hot Work Permit\n\n12.    Contractors\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 2012, an estimated 689 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia was released over a course of about 20 minutes.  The initiating event was determined to be a corroded pipe near the wine tanks.  A security guard was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure, treated, and released.  The root cause was determined to be insulation failure and water intrusion, leading to corrosion of the pipe.  System shut down was initiated, equipment isolated, and emergency agencies notified\n\n\n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility maintains an Emergency Response Program.  As a facility that will not respond to uncontrolled releases, the emergency response measures primarily include the safe evacuation of all personnel and notification to outside emergency responders.  Incidental releases that do not pose an imminent safety hazard may be abated by refrigeration contractor technicians who are trained to provide such a response, are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), are authorized by the facility to perform such activities, and are in the area of the release at the time of discovery.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\n1.    Update Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams.\n\n2.    Develop industry standard operating procedures.\n\n3.    Improve equipment/pipe labeling and valve tagging.\n\n4.    Revise CalARP program implementation procedures.\n\n5.    Enhance mechanical integrity program.\n\n6.    Replace pressure vessel.\n\n7.    Compile missing process safety information.\n\n8.    Modify charge line and label.\n\n9.    Evaluate pressure relief system.\n\n10.    Improve contractor orientation and communications.\n\n11.    Conduct structural and seismic assessment.\n\n12.    Train personnel to manage CalARP Program.\n\n"
