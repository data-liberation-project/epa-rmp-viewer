The company stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia in pressure vessels. \n\n\n\nUnited Prairie Cooperative believes that the health, safety, and the preservation of our environment are critical components of effective management and business success. As a company, we are committed to:\n\n?    Providing a secure and health conscious work environment for employees and visitors.\n\n?    Conducting our business with always having value for the community in which -we operate and being a good neighbor.\n\n?    Maintain or exceeding the requirements of the environmental, health, & safety laws and regulations at the local and federal level.\n\n?    Training employees on the environmental, health & safety requirements of their jobs and sustaining a level of competency that     those requirements demand.\n\n?    Working with government and other stakeholders to identify and solve problems.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000 gallon pressure vessel that is filled from semi-transports and then placed into nurse tanks. The nurse tanks are then picked up by farmer's who transport them to their fields where the anhydrous ammonia is injected into the soil as a source of fertilizer.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety release valves that are designed to release pressure in the event the tank becomes over pressurized. The tanks are also equipped with excessive flow valves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release should happen.  In addition emergency shut off valves are installed on the tanks piping and on the load out platform to further allow employees to limit the accidental release of product from the storage containers.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is created to show how far a plume of ammonia with a concentration greater than 200 parts per million (PPM) would travel before being dispersed to a safe exposure level. \n\n\n\nA complete discharg"

      "SummaryText": "e of the storage vessel would be a very unusual event. We are also required to create an alternative or more likely release event. Although we will continue to do what we can to ensure no accidental release occurs, we have chosen a 2-inch pipe or hose rupture\n\nto meet this requirement. Again, calculations show the extent of the plume with an ammonia concentration greater than 200 PPM. \n\n\n\nWe have used Degadis Modeling tool to calculate the area these types of releases would impact. Degadis has been reviewed from the TFI's my-RMP website to assure the most current information is communicated in this Risk Management Plan.  Our written programs are continually updated and are available for review at the ammonia storage locations. \n\n\n\nIn the event of a release from a storage facility that could impact the community, we advise those in the affected area to shelter in place until the plume dissipates. Shelter in place involves everyone in the affected area seeking shelter indoors, shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning and other ventilation systems.\n\n\n\nUnited Prairie Cooperative has not operated an Ammonia Plant therefore has no five years history for this facility. No one was injured or evacuated due to those releases. Vandalism and theft from nurse tanks has not taken place.\n\n\n\nOur employees are trained in the characteristics and proper handling procedures for anhydrous ammonia. They are equipped with the proper personal protective equipment for routine handling of the product. The training also covers the basics in responding to emergencies involving ammonia releases and is available to assist the community first responders with technical information and advice.\n\n\n\nUnited Prairie Cooperative shares training material and emergency response information to the local fire department. We also will meet with any concerned citizen and other interested parties about our risk management program and anhydrous ammonia safety in general.\n\n\n\nTraining is continual"
