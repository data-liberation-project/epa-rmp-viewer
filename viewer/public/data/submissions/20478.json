This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting.  The refinery covered processes are included in the RMP Program 3 criteria.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest storage tank containing normal butane (n-butane).  This scenario would release 6,300,000 pounds of butane, assumed to release instantaneously, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  This event would have off-site consequences from the explosion pressure wave.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThere are three alternate release scenarios (ARSs) considere"

These ARSs are also for flammable substances at the refinery and are represented by a VCE resulting from the release of butane or propane. \n- A broken pipe at the base of a product butane sphere releasing a flammable mass of 6,920 pounds of butane. \n- A ruptured loading hose loading into a butane transport releasing a flammable mass of 6,990 pounds of butane.\n- A split pipe at the base of a process unit propane storage tank releasing a flammable mass of 8,020 pounds of propane.\n\nThese events would have off-site consequences.  These events are selected as being practical scenarios for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Sunoco Tulsa Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each applicable OSHA PSM element and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery encourages employees to participate in all elements of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include employees serving as members on Process Hazards  Analysis teams as well as Incident Investigation teams.  Employees also serve as trainers and procedure writers. Employees also form the Emergency  Response Fire Brigade and Haz Mat teams for the refinery and receive a high level of training to maintain qualifications.  Employees participate in our Joint Health, Safety and Environmental committee.  Also, there is a voluntary Safety Environmental Rover program in which our employees provide their services performing various audits and enhancing their safety a"

      "SummaryText": "wareness. Our process unit operators monitor their areas of responsibility and provide monthly reports on the status of various safety and emergency response equipment. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information (PSI). Each process unit has its specific PSI training material for the operating personnel.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  Each process area also has available all the equipment listed including what, if any, chemicals or hydrocarbons are present and a hazard rating based on the National Fire Protection Association system.  For each process area, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g.; temperature, level, pressure) and studied hazard scenarios via the Process Hazards Analysis process.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information,"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and What-If technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP and What-If analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience backgrounds across the organization.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are documented for local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  Resolution of items can be categorized as Procedures, Repairs of Existing Equipment, Engineering Studies and Installing new equipment.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sunoco Tulsa Re"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are updated through a process called Management of Change (MOC).  These written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:  (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \n\nOur contractor safety program is accomplished by providing contractors with an initial orientation meeting which provides:  (1) site specific hazards by using Point of Work (POW) Card"

In addition, the Sunoco Tulsa Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance and perform various audits to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  A weekly Contractor Safety meeting is held with representatives of our contractors.  Contractors participate by presenting topics and the minutes are distributed to all attendees.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The facility Mechanical Integrity Program includes:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training "

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  \n\nInspections and equipment tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or  key personnel will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is Positive Material Identification (PMI) for equipment containing alloy materials.  The Sunoco Tulsa Refinery incorporates PMI measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the operating procedures, the Sunoco Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees are required to complete a thorough training program.  This program includes (1) formal in-unit training, (2) classroom training, (3) on the job training, (4) self-study training, and (5) testing.  The program could take up to 36 months to complete depending on the experience level of hired employees.  Personnel with experience in the refinery or related industry may receive credit towards the completion of the training program.  \n\nDuring the training program, each trainee must successfully complete all\nfacets of the program which include; (1) basic refinery training, (2) off the job related studies, (3) job specific training, (4) testing ("

Each trainee must attend all required safety training, and meet minimum requirements in supervisory evaluations every six months to remain employed.  After successfully completing the trainee program, the employee will have adequate knowledge to perform the duties of the assigned jobs at the assigned process unit within the refinery.\n\nIn addition, all operators are recertified every three years in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  This recertification process includes (1) any necessary refresher training, (2) written testing, and (3) skill demonstrations.  Operators must recertify on all jobs on which they are qualified at their assigned process unit.  All training and testing is documented for each individual operator.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include (1) control of entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemical technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Any change which has a potential impact on quantities of new or existing toxic or flammable hydrocarbons must be review by the RMP Coordinator.  Documentation of employee training on the change is covered under PSSR.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team is led by an experienced supervisor or technical representative, and includes other required technical support and those employees responsible for the work in the area of the incident. \n\nThe incident investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS \n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Sunoco Tulsa Refinery periodically hosts a Sunoco Audit Team to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being imp"

An incident occurred on April 25, 1999 at our Coker Unit during startup activities.  A process tower had an internal explosion and resulted in a fire.  One Sunoco employee received a recordable injury as a consequence of the blast shock.  There was no exposure to the public of any hazardous material.  There was no outside residential damage attributed to this event. There was no damage to the environment. The fire was contained  by the Sunoco Emergency Response Brigade, but the Tulsa Fire Department responded to our site on their own initiative.  They provided seconday damage assessment at the incident location. In addition EMSA, Tulsa Police and Tulsa County Sheriff Department also responded on their own initiative on standby service.    \n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery does not have any reportable \"toxic\" chemicals in quantities that meet the threshold criteria in the RMP rule.  Some of the community may recall an incident in 1988 at our refinery where a small amount of toxic HF Acid vapors were released and drifted into an area adjacent to the refinery.  However, in 1992 the refinery was reconfigured and the process which contained HF Acid was taken out of service.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.
