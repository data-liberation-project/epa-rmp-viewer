This recertification process includes (1) any necessary refresher training, (2) written testing, and (3) skill demonstrations.  Operators must recertify on all jobs on which they are qualified at their assigned process unit.  All training and testing is documented for each individual operator.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include (1) control of entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

An incident occurred on April 25, 1999 at our Coker Unit during startup activities.  A process tower had an internal explosion and resulted in a fire.  One Sunoco employee received a recordable injury as a consequence of the blast shock.  There was no exposure to the public of any hazardous material.  There was no outside residential damage attributed to this event. There was no damage to the environment. The fire was contained  by the Sunoco Emergency Response Brigade, but the Tulsa Fire Department responded to our site on their own initiative.  They provided seconday damage assessment at the incident location. In addition EMSA, Tulsa Police and Tulsa County Sheriff Department also responded on their own initiative on standby service.    \n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery does not have any reportable toxic chemicals in quantities that meet the threshold criteria in the RMP rule.  Some of the community may recall an incident in 1988 at our refinery where a small amount of toxic HF Acid vapors were released and drifted into an area adjacent to the refinery.

(R&M) Tulsa Oklahoma Refinery, hereafter referred to as the Sunoco Tulsa Refinery, has a long-standing commitment to worker, contractor, and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting.  The refinery covered processes are included in the RMP Program 3 criteria.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest storage tank containing normal butane (n-butane).  This scenario would release 6,300,000 pounds of butane, assumed to release instantaneously, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  This event would have off-site consequences from the explosion pressure wave.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThere are three alternate release scenarios (ARSs) considere"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and What-If technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP and What-If analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience backgrounds across the organization.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are documented for local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  Resolution of items can be categorized as Procedures, Repairs of Existing Equipment, Engineering Studies and Installing new equipment.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sunoco Tulsa Re"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information (PSI). Each process unit has its specific PSI training material for the operating personnel.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  Each process area also has available all the equipment listed including what, if any, chemicals or hydrocarbons are present and a hazard rating based on the National Fire Protection Association system.  For each process area, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g.; temperature, level, pressure) and studied hazard scenarios via the Process Hazards Analysis process.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

A weekly Contractor Safety meeting is held with representatives of our contractors.  Contractors participate by presenting topics and the minutes are distributed to all attendees.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Sunoco Tulsa Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
