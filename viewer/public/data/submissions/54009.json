This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Samson policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSamson operates the Townsend No. 1 Production Facility in Jackson Parish, Louisiana.  This facility is a natural gas processing plant which removes liquids from a gas stream.  Mixed liquids removed from the gas stream are stored in a pressurized bullet tank prior to being shipped off site in tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, the Townsend No. 1 Production Facility is a Program 1 process.\n\nThe Townsend No. 1 Production Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantity of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nSamson identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulated toxic substances.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that the Townsend No. 1 Production Facility is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offisite consequence analysis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Townsend No. 1 Prod"

Emergency response activities are coordinated with the LEPC who will contact the local fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)."
