      "SummaryText": "1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Southern California Gas Company (\"The Gas Company\") maintains an anhydrous ammonia storage vessel and ancillary equipment at its Wheeler Ridge Compressor Station near Wheeler Ridge in Kern County, California. The maximum capacity of the tank is 35,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The facility is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions of 40 CFR \u00a768 because the potential amount of ammonia on-site exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds defined in \u00a768.130, Table 1.  A Risk Management Plan (RMP plan) must therefore be prepared for the ammonia process at the Wheeler Ridge Compressor Station.  The facility falls under the provisions of RMP Program Level 2 as it is a normally unoccupied facility.  However, it is remotely monitored 24-hours per day from a company operations center. \r\n\r\nA hazard operability study conducted using a Guide-Word hazard analysis approach concluded that the existing safety systems, procedures, and administrative controls that are in place to prevent an accidental release of ammonia, provide acceptable mitigation for potential accidental release scenarios.  A seismic survey conducted for the RMP plan concluded that the ammonia tank and containment structure are adequately constructed and maintained to provide adequate seismic capacity in the event of a planning level earthquake under the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.\r\n\r\n1.1\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Gas Company is very concerned with the safety of its workers and individuals living and working near the Wheeler Ridge Compressor Station.  The Gas Company has therefore implemented a number measures to ensure that it maintains a safe working environment.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 48621, Pipeline Transmission of Natural Gas.  The compressor station is located in an unpopulated agricultural area on the north side of State Highway 166 approximately 1.5 miles west of Interstate 5.  An anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a maximum capacity of 35,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is located on-site as part of an agency mandated Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission control system. Gaseous ammonia drawn from the vapor space of the tank is used for injection into the exhaust of four natural gas fired compressor turbines to control the emissions of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere.  The ammonia system is comprised of the ammonia tank, unloading equipment, ammonia vapor monitoring equipment, water deluge system, low-pressure piping to the ammonia metering system, and the ammonia metering system used to meter ammonia for injection into the compressor turbine exhaust.    Figure 1-2 shows the ammonia tank, containment system, and rack for the ammonia detectors and water deluge nozzles.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is de"

Actual ammonia usage is governed by the demand for natural gas compression which can vary from year to year. The storage tank is surrounded by a concrete containment structure able to contain the entire contents of the storage tank plus an allowance for precipitation or fire water.  The tank is protected by an automatic water deluge system fed by a 90,000 gallon fire water tank, a six-inch fire water loop around the entire facility, and an emergency fire water pump with battery backup power.  The water deluge system produces 250 gallons per minute of water mist over the tank when activated.\r\n\r\nBoth the RMP and CalARP programs have defined specific threshold quantities for hazardous chemicals covered under the programs.  If a given process uses an amount of the regulated substance greater than the threshold quantity, the regulated substance is subject to the requirements of the program.  The threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia for the RMP program is 10,000 pounds while for the CalARP program it is 500 pounds. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is also regulated by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 in the Process Safety Management Program (PSM) if the on-site storage exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  However, \"Normally unoccupied remote facilities\" are exempt from PSM under 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 (a)(2)(iii).  Therefore, the Wheeler Ridge facility is exempted from PSM as it is a normally unoccupied remote facility and is therefore, not a mandatory RMP Program Level 3 Facility.\r\nThe offsite impact distance of the facility's worst-case spill has the potential to impact an offsite receptor.  As the Wheeler Ridge facility is neither a Program Level 1 nor Level 3 facility, it is an RMP Program Level 2 facility.

According to the hazard review conducted for this process the most probable accident scenario is the release of ammonia during an unloading incident. \r\n\r\nThe land-use surrounding the facility is primarily agricultural.  There are several farm residences located approximately one mile south of the facility.  An interchange on Interstate 5 with State Route 166 is located approximately 1.5 miles east of the facility.  There are several businesses located adjacent to the interchange.\r\n1.2.2\tDescription of the Process\r\nThere are three major steps in the handling of the ammonia from delivery to injection into the turbine exhaust.\r\n1.\tAnhydrous ammonia is received from the supplier by tanker truck.  The ammonia is purchased from a single supplier (AgroChem, Inc.).  The tanker truck is not allowed to enter the facility until after the manifest and bill of lading are compared to the ordered amount of ammonia.  Once on the facility, the truck travels at low speed (5 miles per hour maximum) directly to the unloading area, at which time it turns left and parks on the asphalt roadbed in front of the ammonia tank.  A gravel pad is on either side of the truck parking area.  Once at the unloading area, the truck is secured from movement using wheel chocks and hoses are hooked-up to the unloading station.  The truck engine has a safety interlock to prevent operation of the ignition when the truck is pumping.  In addition to the AgroChem operator, The Gas Company personnel monitor the unloading from an upwind location and control room located on the southern side of the facility. \r\nUnloading is accomplished using a pumping and vapor recovery system on the truck.  The entire contents of the truck are unloaded into the storage tank.  At the completion of loading, all"

The ammonia tank is protected by a water deluge system during unloading.  In addition, a water cannon is approximately 15 m (50 ft) away if needed.  The deluge system and water cannon are supplied by a 90,000 gallon storage fire water system and 6 inch diameter fire water loop circling the facility.  \r\nAmmonia is ordered when the tank is approximately 30 percent full, with delivery when the tank is approximately 20 percent full.  Prior to filling, the level of ammonia in the tank is manually verified by a wipe-down of the side of the tank.  Unloading requires approximately 90 minutes.\r\n2.\tThe ammonia storage tank is designed to hold 35,000 pounds (approximately 6,800 gallons at 60\u00b0F) of liquid anhydrous ammonia that is liquefied by pressure.  The tank is a cylindrical tank mounted horizontally on two metal supports with concrete footings.  The tank is surrounded by a concrete containment structure (dike) with a capacity to contain the entire liquefied contents of the tank plus a 10 percent allowance for precipitation.  Mechanical controls limit the capacity of the tank to 80 percent of maximum capacity.  Above the ammonia tank is a rectangular frame with ammonia detectors and water spray nozzles.  The tank is painted white.  There is an in-line electrical resistance heated vaporizer on the outlet of the tank to ensure as an adequate supply of gaseous ammonia during the colder winter months.  \r\nThe ammonia level (high and low) in the tank is electronically monitored both at a cabinet adjacent to the ammonia tank, in the station control room, and at the off-site monitoring center.

Piping into the tank includes one fill line and two vapor return lines from loading station outside the containment wall, tank drain lines, and a supply line to the ammonia metering system.  \r\n3.\tA single supply line of approximately 2-inch inside diameter carries ammonia from the tank to the ammonia metering systems.  For a portion of the run of pipe, the supply line is above ground but protected from vehicles by metal bollards.  Individual take-off lines run from the supply line to the individual metering systems.  The nominal pressure of ammonia in the supply lines is approximately 2-3 inches of water.  The ammonia metering system consists of a pressure regulator, various valves, high and low pressure sensors, and the supply line to the injection ports on the individual turbine exhausts.  Once injected into the turbine exhaust, the ammonia is destroyed by chemical reaction with the exhaust to form water and elemental nitrogen, with a low parts per million (ppm) level of unreacted ammonia escaping from the exhaust tack as ammonia slip.  \r\n1.3\tWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nOne worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario were identified and modeled in an off-site consequence analysis (OCA).

All operators undergo yearly training in emergency response to ammonia releases.  Additional training is also provided to some employees by the ammonia supplier, Agro Chemical, Inc. \r\nThe site is normally an unoccupied facility but is remotely monitored 24-hours per day from a company operations center.

The response time for the on-call operator in nearby Taft once an alarm is triggered is approximately one hour or less.  Company personnel with responsibility for emergency response are assigned company vehicles and have two-way radios and cell phones.  In the event of loss of electrical power, an automatic emergency battery-powered electric pump will maintain pressure in the fire water loop until an operator arrives.  This loop, in addition to the 90,000 gallon fire water tank, supplies fire water to the facility and to the deluge system on the ammonia tank. \r\n\r\nAn uninterruptable power supply (UPS) is on-site and will provide up to 8 hours of back-up power in the event of a power outage.  A backup natural gas generator is on-site and starts automatically if station power is interrupted. The emergency fire water pump is diesel powered, so there would be no loss of water pressure in the extremely unlikely event of a simultaneous power failure and loss of water head from the 90,000-gallon fire water tank.\r\n\r\n1.7\tPROPOSED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nGiven the design and operational safeguards that are in-place, there are no current plans to upgrade the ammonia storage system for either safety or operational reasons.  One area of improvement that is suggested is to identify and incorporate the nearest hospital in the Emergency Response Program."
