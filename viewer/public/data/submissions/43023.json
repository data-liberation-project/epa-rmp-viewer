      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies  \n\nCalpine Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  It is the policy of Calpine to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, local and fully trained emergency responders be summoned by plant personnel.\n\nThe Pasadena Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Pasadena Cogeneration facility (PC), located in Harris County, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the two gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in three storage tanks, located adjacent to each of the facility\u00bfs combustion turbines.  The storage capacity of each tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPC is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at PC includes:\nEmployee Participation\nAll PC employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP reg"

These documents include information concerning the hazards of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is updated when changes in the process occur.\nInformation concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and stability data, and the effects of inadvertent mixing.\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, process chemistry, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\nInformation concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical area classification, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, material and energy balances, and safety systems.\n Process Hazard Analysis\nPC has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures\nPC maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The"

      "SummaryText": "procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually.\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of PC are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process.  Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.\nContractors\nPC uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work.  The plant also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nPC conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\nMechanical Integrity\nPC has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training,"

The hot work permit program is designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that maintenance activities are performed safely.\nManagement of Change\nPC has a system in place to ensure safety concerns associated with changes to the ammonia process are reviewed and addressed prior to the change.  The changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards as well as to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\nIncident Investigation\nPC will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the catastrophic release of ammonia.  The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors). \nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, PC will conduct a compliance audit every three years.  The plant will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\nAdditional Safety Systems\nPC has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases"

The program addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, spill response measures, evacuation plans and personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.   The PC is a defensive emergency responder to ammonia releases.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Pasadena Local Emergency Planning Committee."
