Simplot Company (Policy Statement EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment. Each manager\\Supervisor is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy. The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to its products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\n\n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company Safety and Health Policy (Policy Statement SA 001) states that the Company is committed to reducing incidents or occurrences in the workplace that result in human injury, illness, or death, and/or destruction or loss to the corporation's assets and to be in compliance with all laws and regulations governing workplace safety. It is, therefore, our intent to provide a safe work environment and to protect the corporation's assets. This guideline applies to all groups and separate operating entities of the J.R. Simplot Company. Emergency plans shall be developed for each operating unit outlining the practices and procedures for emergency medical care, fire response, evacuation, or other emergencies. Each group shall develop and implement appropriate programs for initial and ongoing safety and loss prevention training of employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance(s)\n\n\n\nThe substance(s) that are routinely stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia "

      "SummaryText": "at or above the threshold level for the RMP. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, blended, and then distributed to area farms as a non-hazardous, non-regulated source of land applied fertilizer.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program\n\n         \n\nAt this J.R. Simplot Company retail agriculture fertilizer location, Anhydrous Ammonia is only present in railcars.  There is no permanent ammonia storage at this location.  Occasionally a contractor comes to the site to blend a non-hazardous fertilizer with the analysis 10-34-0.  The contractor connects full railcars of anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid to their batching unit.  Procedures and training for this process is the responsibility of the contractor, as Simplot Employees are not involved with any Ammonia handling.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
