All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nWatts Brothers Frozen Foods, based in Paterson, WA processes fresh vegetables obtained from multiple growing sites into frozen vegetable products for sale in commercial markets. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.  The WBFF refrigeration system is divided into two (2) separate processes; however, these processes are located adjacent to each other.  Due to this proximity, WBFF considers the refrigeration systems as one single process, as the highly unlikely catastrophic failure of one process would adversely impact the other, and has organized the prevention program to be managed accordingly.\nIn order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, WBFF has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. This program is contained in a comprehensive web-based format designed to comply with WISHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the WBFF processing plant.\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Paterson plant has an eme"

      "SummaryText": "rgency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Paterson Fire Department and the Benton County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWatts Brothers Frozen Foods expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of their PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the PHA were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Watts Brothers expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
