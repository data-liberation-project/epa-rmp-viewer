      "SummaryText": "Elmet Technologies Inc. manufactures lighting filaments and a host of other tungsten and molybdenum metal products.  The facility is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule for one flammable substance, hydrogen. The hydrogen is used in various furnaces to provide an inert atmosphere during heating of tungsten and molybdenum.  The facility also stores propane for on-site use as a fuel. Since the hydrogen and propane are contained in the same process as determined by OSHA, both the hydrogen and propane equipment at the facility are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. However, the propane process is exempt from the RMP rule. The facility does not have any toxic substances covered by OSHA's PSM standard or EPA's RMP rule.\n\nLiquid hydrogen is stored behind the facility in two above-ground storage tanks, each having a capacity of 10,150 pounds of liquid hydrogen.  A vaporizing system located next to the storage tanks converts the liquid hydrogen to a gas before it is distributed throughout the building for use in furnaces. Elmet leases the outdoor hydrogen storage and delivery equipment from Praxair, Inc. of Danbury, Connecticut. Praxair is responsible for operation and maintenance of the outdoor hydrogen equipment, and provides the hydrogen supply through regular delivery by tank truck. Praxair implements its own safety procedures for Elmet's hydrogen system, including periodic equipment inspections and driver training.   \n  \nThere have been no serious accidents involving hydrogen in the seventy years of operation at the site.  Elmet has an emergency response team that performs response drills periodically. As part of Elmet's emergency response plan, the facility has developed procedures for notifying the public and providing instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency."
