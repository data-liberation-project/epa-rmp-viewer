      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The CenterPoint Energy Field Services, Inc. (CenterPoint) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCenterPoint operates the Foxskin Compressor Station located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.    The Foxskin Compressor Station is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquified petroleum gas (LPG), a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and hexanes by Joule-Thompson separation with water removal by glycol dehydration.  The LPG and condensate is transported from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Foxskin Compressor Station is a Program 2 process. \n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Sta"

The Foxskin Compressor Station processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations but not OSHA's PSM standards because the plant is unmanned.  This summary describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program implemented by CenterPoint.\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe company also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  CenterPoint utilizes standard operating manuals for pumps, controls and relief valves, API Standards for pipe, vessels, and tanks, and ANSI Standards for the ESD System.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nHazard Review and Analysis\n\nThe Foxskin"

      "SummaryText": " Compressor Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station primarily uses checklists to perform these evaluations. The checklist used in the Hazard Review was provided by persons knowledgeable about the process.  Based on the answers to the questions, consequences and preliminary recommendations can be determined.\n\nThe Hazard Review findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Foxskin Compressor Station assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the Hazard Review team.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through t"

New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station has a plan in place to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  This investigation is lead by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process.  The findings and recommendations made by the incident investigation team are promptly addressed and resolved in a timely manner.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nThe Foxskin Compressor Station is an unmanned site.  All emergency response actions are coordinated with the Caddo-Bossier Parish LEPC.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the Foxskin Compressor Station periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are to be conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit technique"
