      "SummaryText": "1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe Land O'Lakes Spencer Dairy in Spencer, Wisconsin has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia. This facility has implemented an electronic preventative maintenance system. This system uses a real time database to track preventative maintenance, training and inspection dates and issues reminders to responsible groups.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours, 7 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies/emergency response companies including the Spencer Fire Department, Village of Spencer Police Department and Marathon County Emergency Services in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances.\n\nSpencer Dairy repackages bulk cheese and cheese powders at the Spencer, Wisconsin plant. The NAICS code for the primary process at the facility is 311513.  This plant has one regulated substance, ammonia, under 40 CFR 68 at the plant. The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome. Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.  The quantity of ammonia stored on site is approximately 23,000 pounds.  Ammonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  It's distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations and can cause burns.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of the respiratory tract, burning of the skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor and freezing of the ski"

      "SummaryText": "n and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.0 Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at the Spencer plant, a release from the ammonia refrigeration system could potentially affect employees on-site and the general public off-site.  USEPA requires companies to use models for \"worst-case\" and \"alternate\" release scenarios for each regulated chemical.  The Worst case scenario references a leak on the High Pressure Receiver.  The Alternate scenario references a pipe leak.  Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur.   If a release occurred, however, the alternate scenario would be more likely.\n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for the ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3.  The prevention program is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM,  then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Spencer Dairy's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.\n\n\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nA review of this facilities accidental release history indicates no releases in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nResponse to release which is more than an incidental leak will be defensive in nature.  The emergency response program includes emergency communication, emergency evacuation procedures and an off-site plan in the event of a hazardous substance release. For a release which leaves the Spencer Dairy site, the company would work with local officials to notify neighbors so that appropriate safety precautions could be taken. \n\n"
