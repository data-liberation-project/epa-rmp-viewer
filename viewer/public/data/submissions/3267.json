The accident release prevention and emergency respone policies at our facility.\nLogan County Cooperative Oil Association complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia\nstorage and is is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to\nthe prevention of any accidental releaase of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our\npolicy to notify the Stapleton Rural Volunteer Fire Department, and request that the respond to the \nemergency.\n\n2.  A descriptioon of your facility and the regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous\nAmmonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade\nfertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized \nmanagement personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks is 200,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-casee release scenario.\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest\nstorage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer\nhose.\n\n4.  The general accident release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nOur facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and\nregulations.  Our facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and \nand Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institure, Inc.\nand the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111,\nStorage"

Planned changes to improve safety.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Logan County Cooperative Oil Association.  Periodic \nevalulation are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additions specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
