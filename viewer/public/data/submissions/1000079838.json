              "Description": "The Land O'Lakes Tulare, Ca. facility contains 1 Program Level 3 refrigeration system process that uses Anhydrous Ammonia. The process at the facility is the Plant 1 & 2 main refrigeration system. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the Plant 1 & 2 system process is 33,776 pounds.  The Plant 1 & 2 ammonia refrigeration system is the only process present above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, and is designated as a Program Level 3 process and is subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). The reportable quantity for anhydrous ammonia is any release over 100 pounds in a 24 hour period. There have been no reportable accidental releases of anydrous ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThere are Two types of cooling systems utilized in the Land O' Lakes Tulare Plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system: absorption and vapor compression. In the absorption (or flooded) type system, liquid ammonia flowing from the receiver through coils of a heat exchanger, where either water or glycol are flowing counter currently on the shell side of the coils, is cooled by the liquid to vapor phase change of anhydrous ammonia as it boils. The anhydrous ammonia vapors are then compressed and liquefied in a condenser for reuse. The Plant 1 Ice Builder refrigeration system is an example of this type of system it is a latent heat storage unit which stores refrigeration in the form of ice. The latent heat storage resulting from the change in state from water to ice is the key to the success of these units. Large quantities of refrigeration can be stored in a relatively small space.\n\n \n\nThe ice is produced during periods of low demand for refrigeration or electrical energy. It is then used at a later time in the form of 32o F to 34o F cooling water. A vapor compression system consists of four basic components; the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator. The cycle involves two pressures, high and low, which enables the system to produce a continuous cooling effect. Low pressure vapor is compressed, raising temperatures and pressure levels. During compression, heat of compression is added to the vapor as the pressure is raised. At the condenser, the high pressure vapor is liquefied by cooling. The liquid ammonia flows from the condenser to an expansion valve where its pressure and temperature are reduced. The ammonia moves to the evaporator where it absorbs heat from a fluid being cooled. Vaporized ammonia then flows to the compressor suction to complete the refrigeration cycle. The anhydrous ammonia vapors from both types of cooling systems flow through a liquid accumulator where any entrained liquids are knocked out of the gas stream prior to being compressed. This prevents damage to the compressors. The accumulated liquids are pumped back to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe Land O' Lakes Tulare, Ca. Plant 1 & 2 Main refrigeration system is a closed loop system and designed to\n\nrun continuously. When required, the refrigeration system is recharged with anhydrous ammonia by off-loaded bulk anhydrous ammonia tanker truck to the ammonia high pressure receiver. Ammonia is off-loaded through the tanker's flexible hose connected to the high pressure receiver's hard piped charge line. Recharging only occurs when there has been a loss of ammonia from the system. Under normal operation, these losses result from fugitive sources (i.e., pump seals, valves,flanges) and from routine maintenance of equipment.\n\n",

Employees will receive an initial 24-hour training and will attend an annual 8-hour refresher training to keep their certification current.\n\n\n\nMedical Examinations\n\n\n\nMedical examinations and consultations will be conducted on an annual basis for all Spill Team members.  Medical exams should include a complete medical history, phys"

The physician may request additional tests/information.\n\n\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment;\n\n \n\nPersonal Protective Equipment is provided up to Level A protection to be used in Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) situations.  The equipment will be maintained/tested according to the manufacturers guidelines.\n\n\n\nMonitoring;\n\n\n\nUpon initial entry, air monitoring equipment (gas meters or sampling tubes) will be use to determine chemical levels.  Monitors are calibrated on a semi-annual basis.\n\n\n\nPeriodic monitoring will be conducted to ensure conditions have not deteriorated since initial monitoring.\n\n\n\nSituations that may require additional monitoring are as follows:\n\n\n\nWhen work begins on a different portion of the site.\n\nWhen contaminants other than those previously identified are being handled.\n\nWhen a different type of operation is initiated.\n\nWhen employees are handling leaking drums or containers or working in areas with obvious liquid contamination.\n\n\n\nEmergency Spill Response Equipment;\n\n\n\nEmergency Spill Response Equipment is purchased and maintained by the Tulare Land O' Lakes facility. The local Fire Department is responsible for the purchase and maintenance of its own equipment.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan Updates;\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan will be tested, reviewed and amended as necessary on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nThe plan will also be reviewed and amended if one or more of the following occurs.\n\n\n\nThe plan fails to be effective during an emergency.\n\nThe team updates general procedures.  This may result from a post emergency meeting.\n\nEmergency phone numbers or contacts change.\n\nThere are changes in the amount, type, or location of emergency response equipment.\n\nPlan revisions are identified during drills.\n\nApplicable regulations are revised.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety; \n\n\n\n1. Management systems: Ensure that management practices and worker training give priority "

Personnel training: Continue to provide the facilities anhydrous ammonia refrigeration maintenance technicians and operator personnel additional task based knowledge and hands-on-training to further enhance their technical skills and knowledge. \n\n\n\n3. Security measures: Improve facilities security by installing building and cold storage area security systems to minimize the potential for unauthorized activities.\n\n\n\n4. Process design: Install additional sensors to allow better monitoring of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process conditions. Replace older reciprocating compressors with new more efficient screw compressors."
