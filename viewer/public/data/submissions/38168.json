This belief covers on and off-job injuries, occupational illnesses and accidental releases.  DuPont is also committed to keeping its facilities ready to respond to any incident that occurs in spite of our best prevention efforts.\n\nDuPont established PSM on a Corporate basis in 1979.  General definitions, policies and organizational structure that implement PSM are given in Section S21A of the DuPont Safety and Occupational Health Guidelines.  PSM goals, policies and procedures are embodied in numerous corporate manuals and documents such as Engineering Standards, Safety Manuals and Guidelines.\n\nDuPont's LaPorte Plant endorses, adheres to and carries out Corporate PSM policies, procedures and guidelines.  The DuPont LaPorte Plant's Accidental Release Prevention policies come within the scope of the site's existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We apply PSM to all processes and chemicals at this site, not just those covered by the RMP Regulation.\n\nThe stated purpose of the LaPorte Plant's PSM Program is to manage and control the hazards in our processes, to protect individuals, plant equipment, our business integrity, and our community through the elimination of hazards.  PSM involves the application of controls to our processes through operating & maintenance procedures and practices, training, management of change, equipment inspection, and auditing.\n\nThe Principles that govern the DuPont LaPorte Plant's PSM actions are:\n  --All injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable.  We will work in a proactive,\n     preventive m"

This commitment is further evidenced by the site's RMP 5-Year Accident History - there are none of these incidents on our record.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe DuPont facility is situated on about 600 acres of property north and west of the intersection of State Highways 225 and 146, fronting on Upper San Jacinto Bay.  \n\nDuPont is engaged in three (3) major businesses at the LaPorte Plant:\n  --Crop Protection Products - used for improving crop yields and quality at value adding prices\n  --Organic intermediates for Lycra(R) spandex fibers - used in hosiery and swim and athletic wear.\n  --Inorganic acids - used to produce Teflon(R) non-stick coatings and environmentally friendly refrigerants\n  --Plastics for auto safety glass and consumer packaging materials\n\nManagement System\n\nOverall responsibility for the operation of DuPont's LaPorte Plant is vested in a Plant Manager.  All elements of the site's Risk Management Program, including safety, regulatory compliance, prevention of accidental spills and releases, and emergency response fall within the scope of the Plant Manager's responsibilities.  Safety is also considered to be each employee's individual responsibility.\n\nBelow the Plant Manager level, there were three (3) Busin"

Reporting to the Plant Manager is a Site Leader-Environmental Affairs who has overall site responsibility for environmental regulatory compliance. including the development, implementation, and integration of the site's risk management program elements.  A Safety Supervisor who has overall site responsibility for Emergency Response and OSHA compliance reports directly to the Plant Manager as well.\n\nAll operations at this facility including the Covered Processes listed below and the Environmental Control operations are attended 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by well trained, highly skilled personnel.\n\nAll accidental spills and releases occurring at this facility are documented, investigated and the residue, if any, is promptly cleaned up.\n\nSecurity\n\nA high level of security is maintained at the facility at all time.  The facility is not open to the public.  Security personnel are on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to observe and control all site ingress and egress and  to perform frequent on-site and perimeter patrols.  A strict accounting is kept of everyone present at the facility - including employees, visitors, vendors, contractors and delivery personnel.  Vehicular access is tightly controlled.

Our RMP information was actively communicated to the public in a series of \"Roll-out\" events conducted in February and March 1999.  Community dialogue about Risk Management is an on-going process particuarly through efforts with our local Citizens' Advisory Council.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the five years immediately preceding the submittal date of this RMPlan, there were no accidental spills or releases of RMP regulated substances from covered processes at the DuPont LaPorte Plant that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL- SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nDuPont's LaPorte Plant is regulated by and complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation - 29 CFR 1910.119.

Employees are trained in several independent ways of reporting actual and/or potential emergency situations and securing assistance.  All methods of emergency reporting result in the sounding of a site-wide alarm.\n\nThe site-wide alarm automatically alerts the entire facility to the emergency, activates one of two previously designated Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) and summons the Emergency Response Team (ERT) to the incident location.  An Emergency Response Team (ERT) is on duty at the facility 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nThe sounding of the site-wide alarm also initiates a number of other processes including:\n  --immediate mobilization of site emergency response resources\n  --preliminary assessment of the situation\n  --personnel accounting\n  --dispersion modeling to gauge the potential for off-site impact\n  --establishment of a Command Post near the incident location\n\nAt the Command Post, an Incident Commander (IC) takes charge of the situation and organizes and directs the ERT.  The widely recognized National Fire Academy Incident Command System (ICS) is used to manage safety, tactics, strategy, personnel, equipment, logistics and other resources.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained to a high level of proficiency in incident command, interior structural fire fighting, fume and vapor suppression, emergency medical treatment (EMT) including cardiac care and invasive procedures, high angle and confined space rescue and hazardous material response.

The primary function of this technically trained team is to make an immediate incident assessment, mitigate when possible, and summon a fully equipped DuPont Regional Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Response Team if needed.\n\n\nCHANGES SINCE INITIAL SUBMITTAL:\n\nSince the submittal of the original Risk Manangement Plan, there have been decreases in the inventories of RMP regulated substance held on site.  The Risk Management Plan has been revised to reflect this change.  Additionally, a business unit has been sold and the substance associated with that particular business is no longer a part of the DuPont RMP.  Administrative controls continue to be inplemented which have decreased the worst-caae distances for several of the scenarios.  Additional work is ongoing and it expected that further revisions will be submitted in the near term."
