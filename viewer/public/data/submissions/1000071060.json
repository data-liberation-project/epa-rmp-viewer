Chlorine is an effective destroyer of pathogens in wastewater. Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to its discharge into the Maumee River. Our employees and their families live here and we are all dedicated to the safe operation of our facility.\n\nPolicy: Safety of employees and the public are of primary concern. As a part of the public service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment. Our programs include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive training and coordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an emergency.\n\nDescription of the Facility: We treat the wastewater for the City. Part of the process requires insuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the public. Chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in our process. SO2 is used to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to its discharge to the river. Both the chlorination and dechlorination processes are housed in the same building. The risks posed by either process are similar. They are both toxic gasses that are heavier than air and therefore the control and response measures are similar. Protective measures are also similar for both chemicals and are addressed by this plan.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analyses of a Release: In accordance with the EPA rules, an analysis of the impact distance in the case of a release of a chlorine or SO2 cylinder connected to this system was performed. This analysis was made using EPA methods and guidance currently available. Stored chemical not connected to the system and determined to not be at reasonable risk was not included. Our gas system includes automatic monitors with alarms and we have procedures in place to respond to emergency situations. In the event that one of the monitors detects a gas leak, a war"

      "SummaryText": "ning or alarm is activated depending on the level of gas. A warning is activated at 1.5 parts per million (ppm) and an alarm is activated at 3.0 ppm.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be represented by the complete failure (rupture) of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine or SO2 outside of the chlorine room, releasing 2000 pounds of liquid and gas. The Defiance WPCF is located in a river valley, at a low elevation, with many trees and other \"obstructions.\" Therefore the \"urban\" setting was used with EPA's program RMP*Comp. The guidance criteria for these worst case releases is set to take place over a 10 minute period and at an outdoor wind speed of 3.4 mph, either chlorine gas or SO2 gas would travel 1.3 miles before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint for either gas. This is the level at which it is no longer a hazard to the public. Depending upon the wind direction, such a release could affect the eastern side of the City of Defiance, as well as some rural residents. The potential area is approximately bounded by Biede Avenue, Route 24, and Kepler Road. The potentially-affected population within this circle is estimated to be 1,175 people. Marplot software developed by the USEPA and the Census Bureau was used to determine the population. A release of this magnitude could require an evacuation of more than one thousand people dependent upon the wind direction.\n\nThe alternate release scenario chosen represents a more plausible possibility than the loss of a complete cylinder. This situation involves the failure or damage of the fusible plug on a chlorine tank or SO2 tank. This would allow gas to escape uncontrolled for an estimated time of one hour. This type of release would occur within the chlorine room, which would provide a reduction in the release rate to the atmosphere. At a wind speed of 6.7 mph, the gas would travel less than 0.1 mile before the concentration drops below the toxic endpoint. This impacted area would not extend beyond the boundary of the"

      "SummaryText": " facility and no people other than WPCF personnel would be affected.\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator. In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, the EPA and OSHA rules regulate our activities. As part of the requirements of this EPA program, we reviewed our accident history. Over the past five years we found that we have operated with only one incident. A leak occurred during the changing of a chlorine cylinder. A minor amount of chlorine gas was released within the chlorine room due to an improperly attached vacuum regulator. The issue corrected by WPCF personnel. This minor release was determined to be less than the reportable amount for a chlorine related incident. We are dedicated to safety and our overall record proves it.\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with the local fire department, responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. We have training every year for our people and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis. Although we take extensive precautions to prevent a chlorine release, we firmly believe in having a plan in case of an emergency. This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid training.\n\nWe are constantly looking for methods to improve. As part of this RMP program, we have reevaluated all of the plant chlorine processes and safety systems with the assistance of a professional engineer. A process hazard analyses and compliance audit have helped us to identify areas of possible improvement and they are being addressed."
