This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidential release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely corrdinated with the Vigo County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Terre Haute Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and assist in the mitigation of any release.\n\n     2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Ulrich's primary activities encompass chemical repackaging, warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are 5 regulated substances present at this facility.  These substances are Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Aqua Ammonia, Ethyl Ether and Hydrogen Chloride.  At this time, the following are maximum inventory's: Chlorine 1,131,050 lbs.; Sulfur Dioxide 8,950 lbs.; Aqua Ammonia 29,000 lbs.; Ethyl Ether 9,376 lbs.; Hydrogen Chloride 3,600 lbs..  However, due to the nature of our industry, maximum inventory volumes will fluctuate upon customer demand.\n\n     3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(s) & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(s): To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for this facility, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorine.  The scenario involves a release of 180000 lbs. of chlorine, in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind"

The scenario involves a gaseous release of 50 lbs. over 2 minutes.  The release is assumed to be controlled by passive mitigation measures that include utilization of the chlorine scrubber system for absorption.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a gaseous release of 50 lbs. over 2 minutes.   The release is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include utilization of sulfur dioxide gasket and the chlorine emergency A or B kit to mitigate the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n      The alternative release scenario for aqua ammonia involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a liquid release of 2460 lbs. over 5 minutes.   The release is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include neutralization and absorption of spilled product.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n      The alternative release scenario for hydrogen chloride involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a gaseous release of 600 lbs. over 30 minutes.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030mg/l is 0.2 miles.\n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from ethyl ether.  The scenario involves a release of 232 lbs. of ethyl ether from a 55 gallon drum.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, "

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidential release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  Chlorine, aqua ammonia, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are subject to OSHA's PSM standard as set forth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at this facility.\n\n     a). Process Safety Information: Ulrich Chemical, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\n     b). Process Hazard Analysis:  This facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis are the Faulty Tree Analysis and What If techniques.  The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every 2 years or prior to the implementation of a process change.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     c). Operating Procedures:  For the purpose of safely conducting activ"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n     d).  Training:  Ulrich Chemical, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees involved in operating regulated processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years or more frequently as needed.\n\n     e).  Mechanical Integrity:  Ulrich Chemical, Inc. carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by the checks include product storage containers and intermediate bulk containers.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training to ensure maintenance is performed correctly.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n     f).  Management of Change:  Written procedures are in place at Ulrich Chemical, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification.\n\n     g).  Pre-startup Reviews:  Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular pr"
