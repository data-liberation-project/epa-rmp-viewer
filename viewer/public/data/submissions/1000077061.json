These models account for factors that may affect the accuracy of exposure-response estimates, such as data quality or the presence of other risk factors.\n\n    4.5.1.4    Characterizing Workplace Risk - Information gathered from the three previous steps is distilled to form a clear picture of the nature and magnitude of the work-related risks.

Examples include local exhaust ventilation to capture and remove airborne emissions or machine guards to shield the worker.
