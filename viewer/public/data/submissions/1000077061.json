Over the course of a year, approximately 1,000,000 pounds of varying concentrations of peracetic acid will be produced and shipped out of the facility.\r\nThe facility is regulated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) which monitors the storage of chemicals at the facility.  Because of this, security measures are very high at the facility in preventing unauthorized access to the storage area, the production area, and cyber security attacks.\r\nThe facility is not currently under the OSHA PSM rule, but there are plans to increase the concentration of a chemical that would put the facility into PSM.  Currently, the facility operates as though it is under the PSM rule for additional safety.\r\n \r\nThe five-year accident history:\r\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last five years.\r\n \r\nERP Elements:\r\nThe facility's emergency response plan has been reviewed by the local fire department and the state.  Personnel working at the facility are trained in the plan as well as receiving other relevant training in hazardous material handling.  In addition, 3 managers in the company, including one at the facility, are trained to HAZWOPER standards.  The facility is equipped with multiple redundant alarms and intruder monitoring systems.\r\n \r\nUpcoming events:\r\nContinuous improvement on training for employees, planned upgrades to equipment as capital expenditures over the next several years, planned upgrades to current technology for closer monitoring of the facility remotely."
