Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Iowa Double Circle (Stockport) are\n     committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the\n     local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the\n     release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct\n     application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 187,000 pounds of ammonia and 56,600 pounds\n     of propane.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n             tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - The maximum quanitity released would be 110,500 pounds,\n             which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\n             limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to\n             200 parts per millon, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n\n             Propane - The maximum quantity released would be 56,600 pounds.  The distance\n             to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenerio, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n             likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a \n             3 - inch transfer hose followed by release of amm"

The distance to the\n             endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n             Propane - The alternate release from hose rupture caused by a pull-away and\n             assumes a 25 - foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active mitigation devices\n             are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the\n             hose.  The maximum quanitity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the\n             end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety\n     Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published\n     by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S.\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by\n     Iowa Administrative Code Part 21 -Chapter 43 -Rule 43.6(200) -Standard for the storage\n     and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA - 58.\n     The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five\n     years that;  have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility,\n     nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\n     place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.     a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n   "
