The warehouse is approximately 440,000 sq/ft with roughly 29,000 sq/ft dedicated to the storage of DOT hazardous materials. The section of the warehouse that stores covered materials has berms to prevent any spills/releases from exiting the building. There are no drains in the concrete flooring and spill kits are stored throughout. This section of the warehouse is strictly storage with no repackaging or transloading being done. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n- Terminal Warehouse takes every precaution to prevent the release of chemicals whether it is hazardous or non-hazardous. Its primary focus is on the safety and health of its employees, responders, the general public, and the protection of the environment. \n\n- An Emergency Coordinator and alternates have been assigned to the facility and are to be contacted immediately should a release occur. The Coordinator, alternates, and all managers and supervisors have received training in response to non-hazardous emergencies and can evacuate the risk exposures. The responding coordinator will evaluate the scene to determine the risk exposures by assessing the type of chemical released and information provided on the Safety Data Sheet. If the release is of a non-hazardous nature, the release, confine and contain it to the immediate area to prevent further migration. If the released material is known to be hazardous or cannot be determined, all employees in the immediate vicinity are to leave the area immediately and notify the Emergency Coordinator and/or Alternate Coordinators.\n\n- Terminal Warehouse employees are not expected or trained to combat extremely hazardous\n\nreleases.\n\n- Depending on the applicability and the seriousness of the situation, the responding Coordinator\n\nwill:\n\n- Notify assigned team leaders of the emergency.\n\n"
