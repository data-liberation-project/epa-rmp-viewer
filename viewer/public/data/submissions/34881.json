      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Bartlesville Technology Center (BTC) is an OSHA STAR facility that is committed to the overall safety and well being of ConocoPhillips? employees, contract employees and the community of Bartlesville, OK.  This commitment is demonstrated through the development and utilization of the various risk management systems currently in place at the BTC.  These systems primarily focus on the prevention of any incident that may have adverse consequences to the BTC work force, surrounding community, or the environment.  Risk management systems that emphasize prevention of chemical spill or release incidents include:\n\n1.    Hazard Assessments\n2.    Process Hazard Analyses\n3.    Process Safety Procedures\n4.    Training\n5.    Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity\n6.    Pre-Start Up Safety Reviews, and\n7.    Safety Audits\n\nAdditionally, the BTC has developed a comprehensive Emergency Plan (EP).  The EP is a written plan that describes the emergency response system currently utilized at the BTC.  The system identifies specific roles and responsibilities of all personnel involved in the emergency response process.  These roles are identified for all organizational levels of the BTC, including management and emergency response teams.  The EP provides an outline of the organization and procedures to be utilized in response to any major emergency.  Such procedures are directly identified with and applicable to chemical release scenarios.  Periodic drills are conducted to evaluate and refine the EP systems and processes.  These drills are often coordinated with local emergency response entities such as the Washington County LEPC, Jane Phillips Medical Center, and the Bartlesville Fire Department.\n\nFour chemicals are currently stored and utilized in different processes at the BTC that exceed threshold quantities stipulated in EPA?s Risk Management Program Rule.  These chemicals and the maximum amount stored of each are listed below:\n\n1.    Propylene    65,145 lbs\n2.    Isobutane    66,528 lbs\n3.    Et"

Isobutane and ethylene are utilized for research and production of polyethylene polymers.  The chemicals are presently being stored in the north tank storage area of the BTC.\n\nThe applicable worst-case scenario for the BTC would be if the entire contents of the isobutene storage tank (filled to maximum allowable storage quantity) were to be instantaneously released and explode.  This scenario assumes complete compromise of containment by the tank and instantaneous release of the entire contents of isobutene.  Basically, it assumes the walls of the tank disappear and the contents of the tank explode.  This scenario does not consider any of the preventative controls that are in place.  The 1-psi overpressure of the explosion would extend 1,660 feet in all directions.  The RMP regulation uses 1-psi overpressure as the maximum allowable public exposure from a worst-case scenario.  The closest public receptors to the north storage tank area are the Siemens Administration Building, Rodeo Grounds, and the COP Gymnastics Center located to the north, northwest, and east of the BTC, respectively.  None of these receptors are within the affected area of the worst-case scenario.  The worst-case scenarios for the ethylene, propylene and hydrogen processes are identical to the isobutene scenario described above.  However, the affected area for the isobutene process is larger than the worst case affected areas for the other three processes.  The propylene process yields a 1-psi overpressure range of 1652 feet and does not reach any public receptors.  The 1-psi overpressure range for the ethylene process is 1,250 feet and does not reach any public receptors.  Hydrogen has a 1-psi overpressure range of only 528 feet.  It will obviously not reach any public receptors either.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios described above do not consider many of the mitigating control measur"

All pressure relief valves are inspected bi-annually.\n?    Standard Operating Procedures (SOP?s) do not allow the isobutane tank to be filled above 80% of capacity (18,000 gallons) to minimize risk.\n?    The north storage tank area is surrounded by hydrocarbon detectors that automatically detect the release of isobutane and activate a remote and local alarm system.\n?    The area is equipped with a fixed water system that, in the event of a hydrocarbon release, operates automatically to disperse vapors.\n?    The mechanical integrity of the propylene storage tank is thoroughly inspected externally and internally every 5 and 10 years respectively. \n\nThe BTC has not had any accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREP-Risk-Executive:6/18/04"
