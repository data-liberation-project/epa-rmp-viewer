      "SummaryText": "Kruger Feed & Seed\nNorth Bend, Nebraska\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at Kruger Feed and Seed involves, but is not limited to, technologies, procedures, and management practives.  This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the state of Nebraska.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  This facility location (Plant 1) of this company has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 12,000 gallons water capacity and 18 anhydrous nurse tanks with a capacity of 1000 gallons water capacity each, for a total facility storage capacity of 30,000 gallons water capacity.  One storage tank, the anhydrous nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall season.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 53,000 pounds of anhydrous ammoni.  The off site consequences were calculated using \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers.\"  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters "

      "SummaryText": "per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stablility class.  An urban topography was selected as typical.  The distance to the endpoint was 2.6 miles.  It is estimated that 1,309 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumes a 1 1/2 inch hose breaks and leaks 7,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class used in this scenario.  Using urban topography and \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\" the toxic endpoint is .40 mile.  The population within that area is estimated to be 655 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\nKruger Feed and Seed has had no anhydrous leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nKruger Feed and Seed has several key elements in their accident prevention plan.\n1.  The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska.\n2.  Use of good management practives as specified by industry standards.\n3.  Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n4.  Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n5.  Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evalulations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
