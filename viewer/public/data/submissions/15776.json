The Facility Policy               \n\nThe management and employees of AGRI-LAND \nCO-OP are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur,the facilityis preparedto work with the local fire department to mitigate any release and minimizethe impact of the release to people and the envirnment.\n\n\n2 Facility Information.\n\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received,stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n-The maximum quanity stored would be 80000 lbs in our 18000 gallon storage tank.The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of a semi tanker holding  40000 lbs.\n\n3 The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. fThe worst -case release scenario would be the releaseof the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would 80000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)is .83 miles.       \n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is .31 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemted the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute Inc and the standards of the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910 111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous  ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five -year Accident History\n\n     a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries,or significant property damage at t"
