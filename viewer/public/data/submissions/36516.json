This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Brownsville Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass providing public drinking water using conventional water treatment of surface water. We have two regulated substances present at our facility: chlorine and ammonia. Chlorine is present in quantities exceeding the thresholds provided in the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 112). However, anhydrous ammonia is stored or handled in quantities below the threshold quantity provided in the Act. The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 24,000 pounds.  To evaluate the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario analyses, we used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance and EPA's RMP*Comp, Version 1.07.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Water Plant #2 maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process (i.e., chlorination), "

      "SummaryText": "Water Plant #2 maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining: Water Plant #2 has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.\n\nMechanical Integrity: Water Plant #2 carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: vent systems, controls and pumps, and monitor systems. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices by Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) and/or Texas Water Utilities Association (TWUA). Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits: Water Plant #2 conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation: Water Plant #2 promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nFive-Year Accident Release Hist"

The plan includs coordinating with the City of Brownsville to respond to emergencies."
