      "SummaryText": "At this water treatment plant, we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant, inactivates numerous pathogens potentially present in raw drinking water supplies.  The same properties that make chlorine an essential part of protecting the public from waterborne diseases make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State Rules and Regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees.  Our emergency response plan is based on the E.P.A.'s model for Wastewater Treatment Plants and the Chlorine Institutes Plamphlet #64 Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The Emergency Response Plan includes notification of (911) Mission Fire Department Haz-Mat response protocol.  The Mission Fire Department is the primary first responder in all chemical spill or release emergencies in Mission, Texas.  The chlorine is delivered from the vendor in DOT approved ton containers on a flat bed trailer equiped with a hydraulically operated unloading device.  The inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 10,000 pounds. The worst case release scenario of a one ton container would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the contents would be released as a vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint at .0087mg/l (3ppm) would be 1.3 miles as determined by the E.P.A. R.M.P. COMP Model.  An alternative release scenario of a hole in a gas delivery equipment would release 95 pounds of chlorine in ten mintues.  The endpoint of .0087 mg/l (3ppm) would extend a distance of 0.2 miles as determ"

The handling of chlorine in this facility is in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institutes Chlorine Manual and pamphlet #s 6, 63, 64, 65, 73, 74, 89, 151, 155, and 162.  We have not had any accidental releases or incidents in the last 5 years. This facility was constructed in 1983 with the Standard Building Code Standards as well as design engineering for chemical applications. We will continue to improve our operations by incorporating new ideas and principles in responsible safety and care."
