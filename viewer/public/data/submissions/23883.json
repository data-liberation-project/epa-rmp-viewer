The facility produces \n\norganic dyes and pigments and intermediate cyclic organics.  Chicago Specialties uses \n\none regulated chemical in a process above the threshold quantity.  The facility uses \n\nanhydrous ammonia as a feed material in the production of isophthalonitrile.  The regulated \n\nanhydrous ammonia process is a storage vessel, which can store up to 178,500 pounds of the \n\nmaterial.  The facility discontinued usage of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide in the \n\nprocesses in March 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Planning\n\n\n\nIn addition to our existing information sharing practices, Community Right-to-Know, \n\nEmissions Inventories, and Title V Permit, Chicago Specialties shares information \n\nregarding the chemicals used and their associated risk with the public.  The facility uses \n\nboth passive and active mitigation to minimize the likelihood of releases and their impact \n\nto the public and to the environment.  These mitigation systems include emergency shutdown \n\nequipment and revised operating procedures and equipment for the covered anhydrous ammonia \n\nprocess. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccident History and Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nThe table below lists Chicago Specialties' five-year accident history of all accidental \n\nreleases from covered processes, which resulted in off-site evacuations, shelter-in-place, \n\nproperty or environmental damage, injuries, or significant property damage on-site.  The \n\nincident in 1997 occurred on August 4.  During the incident a transfer hose failure \n\nreleased 8,500 pounds of sulfur trioxide in to the environment, of which 7,000 pounds \n\nwere released to the atmosphere.  A portion of the local vicinity was evacuated.  There \n\nwere no deaths or off-site property damage associated with this accident. \n\n\n\nThe facility conducted an extensive safety review after the incident.  Chicago Specialties \n\nhas determined that the most likely cause o"

      "SummaryText": "f the accident was due to water in the unloading \n\nconnections of the tanker truck, which was loading sulfur trioxide into the facility's \n\nstorage tank.  The facility has subsequently installed several safety measures to reduce \n\nthe likelihood of a reoccurrence of this type of incident: improved and upgraded \n\nequipment involved in the process, revised training, maintenance, emergency response \n\nplans, and operating procedures.  The facility also installed new mitigation systems, \n\nwhich significantly reduced the risk of such an occurrence happening again.  \n\n\n\nThe process that contained sulfur trioxide was permanently shutdown in March 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago Specialties' 5-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five year accident history was prepared in accordance with 68.42.  The accidents \n\nreported in the RMP data elements only include accidents related to a regulated chemical \n\n(SO2, SO3, or Anhydrous Ammonia) that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant \n\nproperty damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in \n\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.  There were four releases of regulated \n\nchemicals in the past five years.  Only the August 04, 1997 release meets the \n\nrequirements of 68.42 for a release which must be reported.\n\n\n\nYear        1996    1997    1998    1999    2000\n\nNumber        0    1    0    0    0\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nChicago Specialties believes the best way to manage risk is to prevent accidents.  \n\nChicago Specialties has performed a HAZOP analysis to identify and reduce the risk \n\nposed by the RMP covered process.  The prevention program will continue to reduce \n\nthe risk through improved safety.  Chicago Specialties' process safety management \n\nprogram includes but is not limited to: process safety information, operating procedures, \n\ntraining, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, and management of change.  In \n\naddition, the facility has incorporated process controls including, relief and check valves, \n\nmanual and automa"
