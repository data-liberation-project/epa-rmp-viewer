      "SummaryText": "I.  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nWhiting Petroleum's Stoney Point Gas Plant (SPGP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the plant.  Whiting Petroleum's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nII.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nStoney Point Gas Plant, located near Jonesville, Michigan, operates processes to remove liquids from natural gas.  The plant has a single regulated flammable mixture, which contains ethane, butane, propane, and pentane.  The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances.  Although the inlet gas contains approximately 300 ppm of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is removed in an amine unit, the total plant inventory of H2S is well below the threshold quantity.  Therefore, H2S at the SPGP is not considered a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule.\n\nIII.  Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the SPGP is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing natural gas liquid (NGL).  The tank has a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  The maximum allowable fill volume for this tank is 85% of its capacity or 25,500 gallons, or 121,000 lbs of NGL.  SPGP normally stores less than this amount.  This inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1 -psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 miles.  Although there are numerous controls at the SPGP to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammabl"

      "SummaryText": "e substance at the SPGP is a VCE from the release of natural gas resulting from the failure of gas handling equipment, such as a compressor.  Typically, a gas release at SPGP is expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes.  However, for the purpose of this study, it is assumed that the release continued for 30 minutes, releasing 84,000 standard cubic feet, or 5400 lbs, of natural gas.  The maximum distance to the 1 -psi endpoint for this event is 0.1 mile.  This event was selected as a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nIV.  General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe accident prevention program in place at SPGP is summarized in the following.  Because the SPGP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nA.  Employee Participation\n\nThe SPGP ensures its employees participate in all development, review and implementation aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include compiling and updating technical documents, chemical information and operating procedures; participating in, and providing suggestions on, the emergency response drills; and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, an incident investigation team, or an audit team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\nB.  Process Safety Information\n\nThe SPGP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process techno"

Stoney Point Gas Plant Process Safety Information Document summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available to provide employees with an overview of process safety information and to help locate process reference documents for detailed information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  The SPGP maintains on file process flow diagrams, a description of the process, the maximum intended inventory, safety-related limits for process parameters (e.g., temperatures, pressures, flows, compositions), and an evaluation of the consequences of deviation from defined safe operating limits.  The SPGP ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe SPGP also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design, design codes and standards, safety systems (e.g., interlocks, detection and suppression systems).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities.\n\nAll changes to the process chemicals, technology or equipment are subject to the Management of Change Program (Item J below) to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nC.

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe SPGP primarily uses the what-if analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and regional management for resolution.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nD.  Operating Procedures\n\nThe SPGP maintains operating procedures and manuals that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, temporary operation, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  The procedures and manuals include operating limits that outline consequences of process deviation and steps required to correct or avoid deviations.  They also include safety and health con"

The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Contract Operations Supervisor as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the SPGP has developed and implemented safety work practices for employees and contractors to control hazards during operations, such as, lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nE.  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the SPGP has implemented a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program, including documented initial refresher training, is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process.  Each new employee and each employee operating a newly assigned process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures for the unit.  The training includes emphasis on the safety and health hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job assignment.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least once every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operat"

Contractors\n\nThe SPGP uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities on the covered process.  The SPGP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors hired can accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of  employees, contract employees, or the facility.  The contractor is required to ensure that contract employees are trained on performing the job safely, of the hazards related to the job, and applicable provisions of the emergency action plan.  This is accomplished by hiring only contractors on the Approved Contractor List.  To be kept on such list, the contractor must be familiar with the SPGP processes, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices.  The contractor is also required to document the training, to advise the SPGP of hazards found by the contractor, and to report all accidents, injuries, illnesses and near misses to plant personnel.  Each contractor working at the SPGP is monitored and evaluated at least annually to ensure the contractor fulfills the safety obligations.  Additionally, each contractor new to the plant is given a plant overview and safety orientation prior to entering the plant.\n\nG.  Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe SPGP conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure: 1) that construction is in accordance with the design specifications; 2) that safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; 3) that, for a new facility, a PHA has been performed and recommendat"

The pre-startup safety review team uses a pre-approved checklist to verify all aspects of readiness.\n\nH.  Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe SPGP has a well-established program to ensure that equipment such as pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of accidental releases.  The program primarily consists of developing written procedures, conducting maintenance training, performing inspections and tests, identifying and correcting deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures.\n\nThe SPGP management has chosen to mantain a Corrosion Monitoring Program per the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 510.  Maintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process and its hazards, and 2) applicable maintenance procedures.  Maintenance procedures ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed and documented to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency in equipment is identified, it will be corrected before further use.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The SPGP incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases, installation and repairs to assure consistency with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions.  This practice also applies to contractor supplied equipment and parts.\n\nI.  Safe Work Practices\n\nThe SPGP has long standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and"

Examples of these include:  1) control of the entry/ presence/ exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/ tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nJ.  Management of Change\n\nThe SPGP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, operating procedures, and other changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  The system not only addresses the permanent changes, but also includes emergency and temporary changes.  All these changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the changes.  Affected chemical hazard information, process technology, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  A checklist, Management of Change Request form, is used to facilitate the necessary reviews, approvals, and updates.\n\nK.  Incident Investigation\n\nThe SPGP has established and implemented a procedure to investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, personal injury or death, significant property damage, or release of contaminants which caused or could have caused significant environmental damage.  The investigations are initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root c"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Coeffective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all affected employees (including contractors).  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\n\nL.  Compliance Audits\n\nThe SPGP conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the process safety management and accident prevention program are adequate and being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least once every three years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the management for resolution.  Coeffective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained on file.\n\nV. Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the SPGP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe SPGP has safety features in many areas to help quickly detect a release and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the plant:\n\na.Release Detection\n\nFlame detectors \nH2S detectors\n\nb.Release Containment/ Control\n\n- Atmospheric relief devices\n- Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and burn episodic releases\n- Manual and automatic valves to allow isolation of the process\n- Automatic shutd"

Release Mitigation\n- Dikes to contain liquid releases\n\nVI.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe SPGP has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nVII.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nThe SPGP has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan for worker safety.  SPGP is a defensive responder to accidental spills of NGL.  Upon detection of a spill, emergency responders are summoned by calling 911.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on factors such as modification made to the plant process or operating procedures, or change in the communication procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program for the SPGP is coordinated with the Hillsdale County local emergency planning committee (LEPC), which consists of local emergency response officials, state and local government officials, and industry representatives.  The SPGP has around-the-clock communication capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to meetings with the LEPC, the SPGP conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\nVIII.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSPGP strives to improve the safety of its operation continually.  A Process Hazards Analysis was conducted in February of 2003, and all action items have been scheduled for resolution."
