      "SummaryText": "Facility and Substance Overview\r\n\r\nThe Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. distribution center located in Mooresville, IN will distribute consumer health products for the various consumer products companies that fall within the J&J Group of Consumer Companies.  The aerosol products stored and distributed primarily include the following trade names: Neutrogena Sun Block Spray, OGX hair care products and Aveeno skin and hair products.  These products each use various amounts (or none) of the following propellants [Butane (#106-97-8), Isobutane (#75-28-5), Difluoroethane (75-37-6), Methyl Ether (#115-10-6), Isopentane (#78-78-4), Propane (#74-98-6)].  This facility is leased by Johnson & Johnson, staffed and managed by DHL Supply Chain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consumer aerosol products are typically in metal containers, less than 8 ounces in size, including the product ingredients, as well as the propellants.  The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers.  The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be up to 6,000 individual containers.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe site has experienced no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations or know offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage during the five-year period.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case scenario was performed based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Based on the assumption that the entire contents of a cloud explosion (quantity based on weight of propellant of one palletized unit load of each) the calculated distance (in miles) to the one psi endpoint were calculated to be less than 0.06 miles (the worst-case scenario was for Isobutane).  The calculated distance does not extend beyond the site property line (thus no offsite receptors are impacted).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency and a potential release of flammable mate"

      "SummaryText": "rials within the facility, local emergency responders (Wade Stevens Fire Department of Liberty Township) would be contacted through the use of a 911 call; secondary contact would be made to the Hendricks County Emergency Management Agency, the local district of the Indiana Emergency Management Agency. \r\n\r\nEmployees of DHL Supply Chain (the site operator) and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. are trained and instructed to evacuate through the nearest exit in the event of a release, fire or other evacuation signal.  Employees are not responsible for any action required to contain a release or to extinguish a fire.  Emergency Response Plans and Procedures include a Hazardous Materials Inventory Summary.\r\n\r\nSafety Risk Assessment\r\n\r\nIn addition to monthly routine internal facility inspections, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. contracts Factory Mutual (FM) Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting.  At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events."
