This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators and a licensed refrigeration contractor is permitted to perform system operations.  San Diego Cold Storage has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nSan Diego Cold Storage is located at 1240 West 28th Street in National City, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of various food products.  The system uses a maximum of 14,500 pounds of ammonia.  The process description is presented below:  \r\n\r\nLiquid ammonia in the receiver is fed to the recirculator and evaporators.  At the evaporators, air is drawn over the coils by the evaporator fans.  The ammonia flowing inside the coils is partially vaporized as it absorbs heat from the surrounding air.  The partially vaporized ammonia is returned to the accumulator, where the liquid settles at the bottom of the vessel, while the vapor rises to the top.  The vapor in the accumulators is pulled off by the compressors and discharged to the condenser and evaporators for defrost.  At the condenser, the vapor is condensed back into liquid, which then drains to the receiver to be re-used in the refrigeration cycle.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Preven"

      "SummaryText": "tion Program\r\nSan Diego Cold Storage has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the EPA regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for operating and maintaining the process;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for safely introducing modifications to the covered process;\r\n\u00bf\tInvestigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; \r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for conducting hot work on or near the covered process;\r\n\u00bf\tContractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises;\r\n\u00bf\tAudit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations; and\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee involvement in program development and implementation. \r\n\r\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 poun"

      "SummaryText": "ds).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nSan Diego Cold Storage has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor and the fire department for assistance as necessary.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, and Seismic Assessments have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  San Diego Cold Storage has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
