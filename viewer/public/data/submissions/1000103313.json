An alternative scenario has been selected for each chemical that, although still very unlikely to occur, has a higher probability of occurrence than the worst-case scenario, in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance.\nResidential population, public receptors and environmental receptors were assessed for each chemical within the radius of its associated endpoint. In most there was residential population, no environmental receptors, and no public receptors.  Therefore, there are no public receptors within the maximum endpoint radius of the alternative case scenarios.\n\nAcetaldehyde\nA more likely scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of the railcar unloading system.
