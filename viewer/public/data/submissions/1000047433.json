      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, June 2009, and June 2014. \r\n\r\nRecently, LADWP made significant changes (in June 2014) at the chlorination station, which included the installation of a chlorine dry media scrubber (main scrubber) in place of an existing chlorine wet scrubber. These changes required a revised process hazard analysis for the chlorination station. RMP regulations require the submission of an updated RMP to the regulatory agencies within six months of the significant process change. This Risk Management Plan is the update of the June 2014 RMP.\r\n\r\nThe LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is not s"

      "SummaryText": "hlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\r\nThe North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is located at 11805 Vanowen Street, North Hollywood, California. This facility chlorinates well water before being supplied to parts of the San Fernando Valley.  In 2014, when the last RMP was being prepared, the chlorination station consisted of a chlorine storage room, a chlorinator room, an instrument room, and a chlorine dry media mini-scrubber to neutralize any chlorine release from the pressure relief vent installed on the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit. The installation of a dry media chlorine main scrubber (replacement of the existing chlorine wet scrubber) of one-ton capacity was also in progress. This dry media chlorine main scrubber has now been installed and is operational. \r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of six one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station. The facility is designed for four of these chlorine containers to be connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and two others are stored as spares.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  Thus, the LADWP North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PS"

      "SummaryText": "mary containers run dry. Space is allocated in the room for the storage of two additional containers that are not provided connections to the system.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to vacuum regulator check unit. Chlorine gas under vacuum from the vacuum regulator check unit is fed to one of the four chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  From there, gas then travels under vacuum to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve.\r\n\r\nThe gas header line is equipped with automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves (vacuum regulating valve with check-relief vent), and pressure gauges.  The primary \r\n(gaseous chlorine) bank provides all the chlorine to the station until it is depleted.  The other gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.  Once the primary bank is depleted, the higher vacuum level acts on the diaphragm of the automatic switchover vacuum regulator in the secondary bank, thereby pulling that valve open to start feeding gas.\r\n\r\nThere are a total of eight injectors. Six injectors are located inside the station. The injectors draw chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is piped to diffuser tubes located in the water distribution pipelines. Residual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers.\r\n \r\nThe chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms have each been equipped with two Milram chlorine leak sensors (two sensors in each room) tied in to the Milram monitor in the chlorination electrical room.

The NHWCS also has a chlorine scrubber room which houses a one-ton capacity dry-media type chlorine scrubber (main scrubber). The chlorine storage room, chlorinator equipment room, and the chlorination electrical room are all at ground level.  The chlorine scrubber room is located below the electrical and equipment rooms with the scrubber discharge passing through the roof of the building near the southeast corner. The manufacturer makes performance claims of a maximum chlorine concentration of 25 ppb on the scrubber discharge under design chlorine loading rates. The station has two separate sources of power, thereby minimizing the potential for a power failure.  The emergency response is coordinated from the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, a maximum of six one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station. The facility is designed for four of these chlorine containers to be connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and two others are stored as spares.  The gaseous chlorine system is the station's primary system, and the liquid chlorine system is the backup system.\r\n\r\nIn normal operation, two banks of chlorine containers (each bank containing two chlorine containers) are used to supply gaseous chlorine to the process.  All the four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators (emergency shutoff system) on the angle valves and feed gaseous chlorine under pressure. The actuators will close the angle valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The gaseous chlorine withdrawn from the chlorine containers bypass the evaporators. One bank of two chlorine containers serves as the primary bank and the second bank serves as an automatic backup when the pri"

The detector is able to detect and provide warning of the presence of chlorine gas in the air, giving a locally audible and flashing red light alarm when chlorine concentration exceeds 1.0 ppm by volume.  The scrubber room is equipped with a Mil-Ram leak sensor, which turns off the room ventilation system at 1.0 ppm.  The outputs from the sensors (0-20 ppm) are monitored by the SCADA system. The values can be read and alarms are generated by the system computer at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) control room.  The computer generates the alarm and immediately posts it on a computer terminal screen located in the LAAFP control room.  Additionally, an audio alarm is initiated to further alert control room personnel.  Acknowledgement of chlorine alarms is done at this terminal.  Furthermore, the detection of a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm on any two of those four sensors causes the Halogen actuators to close the angle valves on the containers. The detector system has a battery backup.  Thus, the detector system will continue operating even during a power failure.\r\n\r\nThe North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station had a wet caustic soda based chlorine scrubber system (main scrubber).  This wet chlorine scrubber was recently replaced with a more reliable, efficient, and functionally similar dry-media type chlorine scrubber.  The scrubber is actuated by the chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm that can neutralize up to 2,350 lb of chlorine. The manufacturer makes performance claims of a maximum chlorine concentration of 25 ppb on the scrubber discharge under design chlorine loading rates.  The discharge stack is located on the roof of the building.\r\n\r\nA dry media chlorine mini-scrubber unit (MS) has been installed at the NHWCS.

This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\r\n\r\nEquipment safety information was compiled on the chlorination process.  Specifications for the chlorination process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference.  Details (such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; and safe upper and lower pressures for the chlorination facility) are on file at the facility.  The LADWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nIn 1991, a detailed hazard review/process hazard analysis was conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The hazard review was further reviewed in April 1999.  In April 2004 a hazard review was again performed for the whole chlorination system. The 2009 Hazard review/PHA was further reviewed in March 2009.  A PHA was performed on August 17, 2012 for the replacement of the existing chlorine wet scrubber at the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station with a dry scrubber. A PHA was again performed on March 14, 2014 for the full chlorination system because the chlorine wet scrubber was removed from the chlorination station but the dry scrubber was still under installation.
