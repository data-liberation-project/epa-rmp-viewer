      "SummaryText": "Tempel Steel Company\n1939 West Bryn Mawr\nChicago, Illinois \n\nThe Tempel Steel Company is a metal stamping and heat treating operation that produces various types of metal parts. Hydrogen gas is used in heat treating operations at the facility. Hydrogen is stored in a liquid state in one pressurized 20,000-gallon cryogenic aboveground storage tank that holds up to 10,600 pounds of hydrogen. Ancillary piping connects the hydrogen tank to heat treat process equipment located inside the production building and contains up to 400 pounds of hydrogen. In total, approximately 11,000 pounds of hydrogen is stored at the facility in the hydrogen tank system. \n\nAir Products and Chemical Inc. (APCI) has been retained by Tempel Steel Company to operate and maintain the hydrogen tank system. If an emergency occurs related to the hydrogen tank system, Tempel Steel Company will immediately contact the Chicago Fire Department and APCI. The Chicago Fire Department is aware of the potential hazards associated with the hydrogen tank and is prepared to respond to an emergency involving the hydrogen tank system. \n\nNo accidents involving the hydrogen tank system have occurred since installation of the unit in 1999. APCI has established and maintained operating and maintenance procedures for the hydrogen tank system. Personnel who operate and maintain the hydrogen tank system receive periodic training as required. \n\nA worst-case scenario involving a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 0.25 miles is included in this submittal. An alternate release scenario involving a pipe tear resulting in the release of 11,000 pounds of hydrogen over a period of 8.2 minutes with an endpoint of 0.19 miles from the source is also included."
