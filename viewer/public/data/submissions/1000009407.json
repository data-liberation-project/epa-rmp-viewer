      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Dublin's Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorination Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe City of Dublin's Surface Water Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water pumped from the Oconee River and as a post filtration disinfectant on this same water.   Finished water from this facility serves the residents and industries of Dublin.  Chlorination processes include 1- ton chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room/panel, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.\n\nThe City of Dublin's Utilities Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards.\n*   Operator Training\n*   Prevention Maintenance Program \n*   Process Specific Safety Equipment\n*   Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator \nparticipation\n*   Hazard review of equipment and procedures \n\nFurthermore, the Surface Water Plant has an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process.\n*   Chlorine detectors\n*   Chemical Right to Know Program\n*   Personal Protective Equipment\n\nIn case of accidental release, the Laurensl Emergency Management Agency has an emergency response plan for the Surface Water Plant.\nThe City of Dublin Utilities Department takes a proactive approach to risk management and emergency response.  Preventative measures will provide for the continuous improvement of communications and will maintain effective procedures for the safe handling of and timely emergency response to potential chlorine hazards."
