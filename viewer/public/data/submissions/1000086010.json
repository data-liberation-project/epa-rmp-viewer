The emergency response program:\r\nThe Bendix Warehouse plan is written in an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) format which is intended to respond to contingencies that integrates the requirements of multiple government agencies into one combined document. A contingency can be a spill, release, fire, earthquake, traffic accident, or any other emergency condition that threatens the environment, public safety, employees in a workplace, or other specified subjects; and that would require an emergency response of some kind. The plan is designed to ensure that the facility has the necessary resources available to effectively respond to emergency incidents and is designed and maintained to promote prompt and effective action intended to minimize hazards to human health and/or the environment if an emergency occurs.\r\nBendix Warehouse personnel are trained and expected to follow their Emergency Action Plan (EAP), in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38, and the guidelines contained in their Integrated Contingency Plan.

Major incidents or events are beyond employees' training and resources since there are normally only three employees that work in the warehouse each weekday. \r\nThe EAP takes into account that major incidents or events are beyond the three warehouse employees' training and resources. Hence, each emergency action plan are the Standard Operating Guidelines (SOGs) that describe the actions taken by warehouse employees along with the actions taken by external responders, as applicable, to stop, control or mitigate the event while focusing on the Overall Priorities-Life Safety, Incident Stabilization and Property Conservation. The Bendix Warehouse Emergency Action Plans (EAPs) address medical emergency, chemical release, fire, tornado, evacuation, shelter-in-place (external hazardous materials release), utilities outages, earthquake, and security threats. \r\nCoordinated response actions with outside resources is extremely important and HB Fuller's Environment, Health and Safety Specialist supporting the Bendix Warehouse is a primary member of the St. Joseph County Local Emergency Planning Committee. Since we have only regulated flammable substances and warehouse employees will not be responding to releases to those substances, we have coordinated our response actions with the South Bend Fire Department. A tabletop exercise was held May 15, 2020 to review the Bendix Warehouse Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) with a focus on achieving three objectives (1) Increase awareness and understanding of hazards and the potential impacts of hazards, (2) Clarify roles and responsibilities, and (3) Obtain participant feedback and recommendations for program improvement.

Bendix Warehouse and the regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Bendix Warehouse is operated Royal Adhesives & Sealants, LLC which is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of H.B. Fuller Company. Since 2016, the Bendix Warehouse serves as a distribution center for its industrial adhesive products. \r\nThe facility is located on a 4.49-acre site and is in an industrial neighborhood on the West side of North Bendix Drive, in the North Western section of the City of South Bend, Indiana.  There is only one occupant and is considered General Warehousing and Storage with the NAICS Code 49311.  \r\nThe 4.49-acre site contains approximately 64,500-square foot building that occupies much of the property.  It operates strictly as a chemical warehouse that receives, stores and ships chemicals used to manufacturer solvent and water-based industrial adhesives and sealants, commercial roofing adhesives, mirror mastics and epoxies as well shipping finished products to customers. Bendix Warehouse does not perform any chemical transfer, repackaging or processing operations. It operates five (5) days a week, with occasional overtime on the weekends, and is closed for US holidays. There are seasonal inventory fluctuations, but the three (3) employees normally work a day shift from 8 AM - 4 PM.\r\nThe warehouse is being used for the storage of DOT Hazard Materials Class 3-Flammable Liquids (sealants and adhesives) which are normally contained in five-gallon sealed pails on unitized pallets.  \r\nAlso, Aerosol cylinders (canisters) containing a DOT Hazardous Materials Class 2.1-Flammable Gas with a NFPA 704-Flammability 4 rating.
