Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Martinez Terminal is owned and operated by TransMontaigne. At the terminal, there are several products stored at the terminal, depending on what products are being shipped to them. The storage of these products varies, as tanks are used for different products as needed. This RMP is based upon Naphtha being the primary component that is covered under the RMP regulations due to Naphtha potentially being an NFPA 4 substance. The primary product within Naphtha that is a listed RMP substance is pentane, so we have assumed that the Naphtha product is 100% pentane, which is a very conservative assumption. There are other products at the facility, but they are not determined to be RMP covered substances.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by TransMontaigne. These high standards include:\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulat"

Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the terminal.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Martinez Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP). Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since TransMontaigne has operated the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no RMP covered accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Contra Costa Office of Emergency Services and the local emergency response agencies. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems of TransMontaigne, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n?    The Hazard Review provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leadi"

The Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the terminal include:\n\n?    Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n\n?    An ongoing dialogue with the Rural Metro Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\n"
