If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous for the production of liquid fertilizer.\r\n\u00b7\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in the blending process.\r\n\u00b7\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 131325 pounds in our one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP submit program the 131325 is rounded to 130000.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit program the 131325 is rounded to 130000.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\r\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1, published by The American National Stan"
