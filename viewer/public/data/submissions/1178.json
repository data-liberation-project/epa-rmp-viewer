If an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local and county fire departments to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nOur primary activity at Mountain View Co-op is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored and handled would be 425,000 pounds in our two-30,000 gallon and one-25,300 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of two rail tank cars holding 380,000 pounds.\n\nOur worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 190,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nOur alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .10 miles.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is in compliance with OSHA's standard on \"Storage and Handling Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOur emergency response program is provided to the state and county under the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going "
