Mercer Foods has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours. State regulations require reporting when there is a significant release or a threat of a significant release of ammonia or other hazardous material.  Mercer Foods interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nAny release may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia systems or portions of the system depe"

The General Manager, Engineering Manager, Safety Manager and the Maintenance Manager are to be called if not on site for support.  Incidential releases will be  handled in house. Substantial releases will be handled jointly between Mercer Foods and local responders.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to startup of modified or new processes. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment and process.\n\n\n\nThere are additional full time Managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately. An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks.

In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nA-4    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMercer Foods Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Mercer Foods is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of Mercer Foods Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Mercer Foods.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\n\n\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.) \n\n\n\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Mercer Foods certifies operators following completion of operator training and Mercer Foods's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed und"

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\n\n\nSecond, all Mercer Foods employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Mercer Foods's Management of Change Procedure. \n\n \n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Mercer Foods has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Mercer Foods Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \n\n\n\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.)\n\n\n\n7) Verification of Mercer Foods's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.

It is both the employer's and employee's responsibility to control potential workplace hazards and correct hazardous conditions or practices as they occur or are recognized. The program includes a system for personnel to communicate with management on matters relating to occupational safety and health, including provisions designed to encourage employees to inform the management of hazards at the worksite without fear of reprisal.\n\nThe safety communications system, one of the elements of the IIPP, is readily available and understa"
