The plant is surrounded by light industrial and residential areas. The facility develops new synthetic rubber products that will ultimately be manufactured on a commercial scale at another facility. These products include styrene-butadiene rubber and polybutadiene rubber used in vehicle tires, plastics modification, adhesives, asphalt modification, and other products.\n\n\n\nThis facility utilizes one chemical that falls under the EPA Risk Management Program.  This chemical is 1,3-butadiene, and it is classified as a flammable substance under the RMP rule.  Firestone Polymers has in place accident prevention programs and emergency contingencies required by this rule and continue to believe that effective safety and environmental practices are an integral aspect of sustainable business.\n\n\n\nTHE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nPOLICIES \n\n\n\nIt is Firestone's policy to meet or exceed all safety, health and environmental regulations and industrial standards that apply to our facility. We put significant resources into compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and related OSHA standards, and have expanded our programs to meet the specifics of the EPA RMP Rule. These programs help maintain low levels of risks to our workers, contractors, the public, and the environment.  This is achieved through a two-tier approach of defense-in-depth: (1) Minimize the possibility of serious plant upsets through engineering and procedural safeguards and (2) Thoroughly plan contingencies in coordination with local responding agencies.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOur commitment of resources to our Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management pr"

Each program is intended to be used in combination with each other to help prevent unwanted deviations from normal, daily operations, and to cope with process upsets in a way that minimizes the potential for harm within our fenceline and beyond. Firestone does not consider safety to be a stand-alone practice but, rather, a fundamental element of all aspects of our daily operations. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68, and maintains a risk management program consisting of the following:\n\nA.    Management Systems\n\nB.    Hazard Assessment\n\nC.    Accident Prevention Program\n\nD.    Emergency Response Program\n\nE.    Risk Management Plan Submittals\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the following programs elements that are important to ongoing prevention program: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Employee Participation, Contractor Management, Hot Work, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents at the Firestone facility that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5-year accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nFirestone Polymers has a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Summit County LEPC, the Akron Fire Department, and other local responders. The facility trains all new personnel on the plan, conducts refresher training annually, and keep its personnel aware of any changes to the plan. Our emergency response plan complies with the RMP Rule and other applicable EPA and OSHA requirements.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFirestone regularly reviews our safety program and institute revisions as appropriate to enhance safety and promote continuous improvement of our operations.\n\n\n\n"
