(AUT) is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nAUT is located at 122 Parker Street in Newburyport, Massachusetts.  AUT manufactures a variety of of polyurethane foam products and is classified under the NACIS Code of 326150, urethane and other foam products (except polystyrene) manufacturing. \n\n \n\nPolyurethane foam is a product made of combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction.  The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  The TDI is stored in four (4) storage tanks - two (2) 10,000 gallon storage tank and two (2) 7,600 gallon storage tank. Therefore, the total combined maximum physical volume on site at any one time is approximately 35,200gallons or (357,984 pounds).\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.   Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regul"

Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nAUT is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response.  AUT's specific prevention steps include:\n\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process,\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and   \n\n   emergency response personnel.\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n    \n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\n\n\n\nThe RMP requires AUT to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative.  The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident.  EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a b"

      "SummaryText": "asis for any specific actions.\n\n\n\nA release from one of the TDI storage tanks with a capacity of 10,000 gallons has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment. The 10,000 gallons of TDI equates to approximately 101,700 lbs of TDI.  The two (2) 10,000 gallon TDI storage tanks located inside the building within a chemical storage room\n\n\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPComp Model.  The RMPComp model estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.4 miles for the worst case scenario.  The impact distance extends beyond the facility property.   There are no people live within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  AUT has determined that the most likely alternative scenario for the facility is a process piping release (flange leak or failure in process line) from the process line carrying TDI from the tank to the pouring head.  The leak would release approximately 1,080 lbs of TDI.  The RMPComp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario.  The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are no people living within the potentially affected area.\n\n\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: \n\n\n\nAUT will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review.
