The facility primarily consists of a deethanizer  (DeC2), a depropanizer (DeC3), a debutanizer (DeC4), two deisobutanizers (DIB), ethane treater, and on site storage facilities.  Process heat is provided by a closed loop hot oil system using direct fired natural gas furnaces.\n\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic material exceeds the threshold quantity set by 40 CFR 68.130.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Norco Fractionation Plant are ethane, propane, rerun propane, butane, isobutane, raw make and natural gasoline.   Because the distance of the worst-case release of a flammable substance reaches public receptors, and the Plant is subject to OSHA PSM, the Norco Fractionation Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Enterprise policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will"

Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  The worst case scenario for the Norco Fractionation Plant was calculated according to the requirements of the RMP regulation.  Details on the resutls of the worst case scenario calculations are given in the RMP registration document.  \n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the RMP program.  One possible, more likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for a propane storage bullet.   Details on the calcualted alternate case scenario are included in the RMP registration document. \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Norco Fractionation Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.   \n\nGeneral Accident Release Program\n\nThe processes at the Norco Fractionation Plant are regulated by the EPA's RMP program and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Within this program, each process has been systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nTwo main methods used to perform the PHA are hazard and operability and the what-if/checklist method analysis.  These analyses are conducted using people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The goal is to identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and then make final suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures where they are determined to be necessary.\n\nPHA findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to the findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned in the PHA analysis.  These rankings help to ensure that the potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completion, when final resolutions are documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  The periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years while the process is in operation.  The results and findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the results and findings are documented and retained.  These analyses are also subject to amendment, if necessary, within the facility Management of Change program. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Fractionation Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as"
