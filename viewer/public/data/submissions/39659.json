This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Okabena Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\nexpertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank inter-connected with a 12,000-gallon tank, three 1,450-\ngallon nurse tanks, five 1,140-gallon nurse tanks, and twenty-nine 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our\nfacility in Okabena, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 68,892.5 gallons\n(354,520.8 pounds) at  85% standard maximum storage capacity including the capacity of the on-site\nnurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 183,712.2 pounds at  85%\nstandard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.
