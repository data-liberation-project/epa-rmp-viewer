      "SummaryText": "The Sam A. Head, Jr. Water Treatment Plant, also known as the South Water Plant, has been successfully providing water to the community of Columbus, Mississippi for almost five years.  Located on Datco Road off of Highway 69 South, the plant lies in the southeast corner of Columbus.  On average the plant treats 4.5 million gallons of groundwater per day and has the capacity to treat over 8 million gallons per day.  The Plant boasts of a flawless safety record with no accidents to report over the history of the facility.  This flawless safety record can be attributed to the awareness and conscientiousness of the administration and staff.\n\nTo further improve the overall safety of the plant, a Risk Management Plan has been developed for chlorine, a hazardous chemical used in the treatment process.  When dealing with hazardous chemicals, it is imperative to take all necessary precautions to protect the safety of the employees and the surrounding community.  The South Water Plant has accomplished this through constant employee safety training, the use of proper methods and equipment for handling chlorine, and the preparation of emergency response procedures.\n\nChlorine is an essential chemical in the treatment of drinking water.  It is a strong disinfectant and is used in the treatment process to eliminate any pathogenic organisms in the final supply.  The chlorine at the South Plant is stored on-site in one-ton cylinders and 150-pound cylinders in the chlorination room, which is located on the first floor of the main building.  A maximum inventory of 25,800 pounds can be found at the plant at one time.  The chlorination room serves to supply, meter, and apply the chlorine to the final water stream.  \n\nChlorine is listed by the EPA as an extremely hazardous substance (EHS.)  It has a characteristic penetrating odor and is greenish yellow in the gas phase and clear amber under pressure in the liquid phase.  Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant, while liquid chl"

      "SummaryText": "orine will cause burning to the eyes and skin.  Yet, with the proper equipment and proper handling of this chemical, the hazards can be controlled.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Plan, both a worst case and an alternative case  release scenario were examined and the off-site impacts were analyzed.  Scenarios established and recommended in the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants-Off-Site Consequence Analysis were used for the analysis.  The worst case release scenario assumes the release of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine over a 10 minute interval.  The distance to the toxic endpoint, or the affected area, for this type of release is 1.3 miles from the spill.  Facilities that would be impacted off-site within this radius include residences (approximately 4,700 people), recreational areas, and various industrial and commercial areas. \n\nThis scenario, although possible, is very unlikely to occur at Columbus's South Water Plant.  This model assumes that the spill takes place outside.  Yet, all cylinders at the facility are stored inside the chlorination room in the main building, which would serve as an enclosure for the gas.  The only time the cylinders are outside is during unloading from the vehicles upon delivery to the plant.  The EPA suggests using a factor of 0.55 to determine the actual release rate if the chemicals are inside a building, but the original release rate was chosen to cover the minor amount of time the cylinders are being unloaded outside.  Another important factor to consider is the density of chlorine gas.  Chlorine is denser than air and, therefore, will sink to the lowest elevation. In the event of a spill, employees can retreat to the second floor of the main building.  By climbing to the second story, they can avoid the toxic chlorine fumes being released on the first floor.   \n        \nThe alternative release scenario chosen for chlorine is a much more probable assumption in the unlikely event of a spill.

      "SummaryText": " This scenario assumes the failure of a fusible lead plug, a portion of the pressure relief device, resulting in a 0.25 inch hole through which liquid chlorine escapes.  This release allows 2,000 pounds of chlorine to spill at a rate of 150 pounds/minute.  The affected radius for this type of spill is 0.20 miles, which would cause some off-site impact.  A small number of residents and one industry are located within the affected area.  A total population of approximately 65 people would be affected by this type of release.  As with the worst case scenario, this type of release would also most likely occur indoors.  Therefore, this spill would be enclosed and not spread to as great of an area as predicted before it could be controlled. \n\nAnother part of the Risk Management Plan is the prevention program.  This program covers safety information, a review of potential hazards, operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance of equipment.  It is essential to have up-to-date and complete information available on these topics to protect the employees and the surrounding community by eliminating possible hazardous situations.  The Sam A. Head, Jr. Water Treatment Plant keeps current material safety data sheets on chlorine available to the staff at all times.  There are also equipment specifications and the appropriate codes and standards used to operate the process available in the main building.  \n\nA hazard review of the chlorination process was conducted on May 19, 1999.  The purpose of the hazard review is to identify all hazards associated with the chemical and the process, opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error, safeguards in place, and detection or monitoring equipment in place or needed.  Possible hazards identified include toxic releases, overpressurization of a cylinder, and equipment failure.  Safeguards in place to protect against these hazards include vent lines, manual shutoff valves, fire resistant walls, and the fact that the cylinde"

Leak detectors are provided in each of the chlorine process rooms and will trigger audible and visible alarms outside the chlorination room and in the operators' room. \n\nOperating procedures are available to all employees in the Operation and Maintenance Manuals, which are located in the main office building.  These procedures cover normal and emergency operations of all the chlorination equipment and include specific steps to be carried out in the case of a release.  All operators working in the plant have been properly trained on the plant operations and emergency procedures.  Classroom and on-the-job training is conducted monthly to refresh employees on safe handling procedures.  There are also plant operators certified to use self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA's), and training is provided on SCBA's quarterly.  Routine maintenance of the equipment is conducted by trained operators.  An outside contractor is brought in annually to service the chlorination equipment.\n\nDue to the safety procedures discussed above and the adherence to these procedures by the plant operators, the South Water Plant has never had an accidental release.  Although it is unlikely that the plant will have an accidental release in the future, emergency response plans are in place in the event one does occur.  The Plant has coordinated with the Lowndes County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to be included in the community emergency response plan.  By being included in this plan, the LEPC will respond to a potential release at the facility.  In addition to this, the plant has also set-up written procedures to be carried out by employees in the event of a release.  These procedures outline safe handling procedures for the leaking containers and require immediate notification to the emergency response agency.  The Plant has also  been furnished with the Chlorine Han"
