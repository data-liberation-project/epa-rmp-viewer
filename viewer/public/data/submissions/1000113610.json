This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, resources such as training, design considerations, installation and maintenances of each process and facility. Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release occurs, the intent is that our trained personnel will respond to and contain the release. We support and work closely with emergency responders who might assist Energy Transfer in the event a release occurred.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Rosewood Dew Point Control Station is located 7.9 miles north-west of Gilmer, Texas. Specifically the address is 7176 Ermine Rd, Gilmer, Texas. The facility is a small facility that is designed to remove a portion of the heavier hydrocarbons such as Hexane and heavier from a gas stream in order for the gas stream to meet pipeline specification. The facility currently has an inlet gas throughput of slightly less than 5.0 MMSCFD of inlet gas and produces approximately 1,600 gallons per day of MGL product. The Rosewood facility does not use, process or store reportable quantities of toxic substances. The facility is subject to the EPA RMP program due to quantities of flammable materials greater than 10,000 pounds.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable material in processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion involving NGL liquids contained in S-530, Product Storage Tank, with a maximum full level of 22,153 gallons. The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable mixture was calculated and determined to be 0.40 miles using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule and the calculations provided by RMP*Comp. \nAn alternat"

Using RMP*Comp it was determined that a release of this amount of vapor would result in an ARS endpoint distance of 0.30 miles..\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(B)(1)).\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Rosewood Dew Point facility. This program addresses guidance from the RMP Prevention Program for Program 2 Facilities.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Rosewood Dew Point facility contains only reportable quantities of flammable materials, specifically natural gas liquids and HD-5 propane which is purchased as needed and delivered to the facility via a transport truck and is stored in two tanks that are interconnected and recovered material that includes small quantities of ethane, propane, butanes and hexanes plus. The facility has obtained and is familiar with the MSDS for both propane and the NGL product.  Additionally, the storage and process limits have been established and communicated to personnel. Equipment information for the processes are either contained in job books, on vessel name tags or has been calculated with results in the RMP manual. It should be noted that overall the affected processes operate at generally low pressures and temperatures generally encountered and thus utilize only a fraction of the capability of piping and vessels.\n\nHazard Review\n\nA HAZOP PHA method was conducted on the affected processes. The size of the facility and the simplicity of the process had resulted in a limited scope evaluation. The previous recommendations from the 2019 PH"

The Hazard review resulted in no recommendations.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBoth general and specific operating procedures have been developed for the operation of the facility. The procedures have incorporated specification for hydrocarbons and the safe handling of these materials with the development of the procedures. Procedures cover startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdowns. Procedures are maintained current and accurate and are updated as often as required.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Rosewood Dew Point facility is a small unmanned facility that generally is operated or maintained by one individual who is responsible for the facility and checks the facility periodically. This individual participates in a training program that is generally conducted by supervisory personnel. Likewise, this individual is relieved by other personnel for vacation time etc. and these relief personnel are trained before being allowed to perform operational duties unsupervised. Training includes job observation and which is  documented within training records in the RMP site manual.\n\nMaintenance Procedures\n\nThe equipment contained in the facility has been reviewed and maintenance procedures have been prepared from vendor books, manufacturer maintenance procedures and operational experience. Personnel are trained on these procedures and training includes periodic job observation. When equipment changes, maintenance training is conducted prior to maintenance being conducted. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Rosewood Dew Point facility conducts periodic audits to determine if practices and procedures required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Generally, the audit is conducted by supervisory personnel"

These audits are conducted at least every three years and are certified upon completion. Each compliance audit finding is tracked until completion and documentation of the two most recent audits is maintained at the facility. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEnergy Transfer promptly investigates all incidents that results in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. Each investigation is conducted so that its root cause is determined and the investigation provides a direction to correct items so as to prevent the incident from reoccurring again. The incident investigation team will document all findings and recommendations which will be presented to Energy Transfer management. Final disposition of all recommendations will be documented and all records of incident investigations will be retained for a minimum of five years and when incidents have occurred, this investigation will reviewed during subsequent PHAs. The Rosewood Dew Point Facility has had no incidents in the previous five years."
