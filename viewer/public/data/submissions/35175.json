      "SummaryText": "The City of Liberal, Kansas has one regu;ated substance ;ocated at the City's domestic wastewater treatment facility.  That substance, chlorine, is used as a disinfectant on the plant's effluent prior to discharge.  The plant has been in operation for twenty (20) years, using the chlorine system.  During this time no leaks or other incidentshave occurred which would cause a threat to the community or to the employees of the faciliy.    The chlorine system is contained in a building on the waste treatment facility grounds, located on the east side of the city.  The chlorine is in a gaseous state and it's release would present a toxic hazard to the surrounding community.  It is estimated that a \"worst case\" release would cause a gas to travel a distance of 2.6 miles before dissipating to a non-hazardous level.  The most likely occurance would a release to the east over the wastewater lagoons and landfill.  In the case of a release, the fire department would initiate our community emergency response plan.  This plan would include notification to the public and possible evadcuation of the affected areas.  Efforts to ensure that equipment and procedures are non-threatening to the community are on going.  These include regular training session emergency equipment replacements and upgrades were completed in 2003."
