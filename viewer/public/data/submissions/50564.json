      "SummaryText": "any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  We coordinate our emergency plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC, our facility\u00bfs Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  TOTAL Bayport has been an active member of the LEPC since purchasing the plant in 1992.  The planning effort of the LEPC helps ensure our emergency plan is coordinated with that of the local municipalities.  \n\nTo quickly and effectively respond to emergencies at our facility, TOTAL maintains both a mobile aerial foam truck and a fast attack truck onsite.  The entire plant is surrounded by an underground firewater header that will supply firewater from our 1.2 million gallon firewater storage tank.  In addition, our firewater system is also tied into the fire water system of the neighboring plant. This serves both as a backup to our system and offers additional firewater capacity if needed.  Fixed fire monitors and deluge systems are in place throughout the facility to respond to fires.  We have emergency flares in place to safely combust flammable chemicals during upsets or emergencies.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\nThe facility has a Whalen alarm system to alert nearby persons during emergencies.  We also have procedures in place to alert the surrounding communities during emergencies. \nWe employ trained emergency responders, including onsite industrial firefighters, who train annually at the Texas A&M University Industrial Fire Fighting School.  We also have an onsite emergency medical team and an onsite rescue team.  Our hazardous materials response team is HAZMAT certified and can respond to incidents both on and offsite.
