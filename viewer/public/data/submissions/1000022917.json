Supervalu operates many retail grocery stores throughout the Eastern U.S. that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Denver, PA. Supervalu Refrigerated  Distribution Center #8790 located on this facility employees 895 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\nSuperValu's Denver, PA distribution center stores and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. The Denver facility has never experienced  a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nPursuant to PSM regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Supervalu has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of ammonia refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Denver facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (ERM-West, Inc.), and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP Requirements in 2001.\n\nSupervalu's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \n\nSuperValu is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Denver PA distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation , and maintenance of the system. SuperValu's employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at SuperValu should be addressed to SuperValu's Environmental Affairs Department."
