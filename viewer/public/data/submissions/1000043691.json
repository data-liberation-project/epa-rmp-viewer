In the trailer system, each tube contains 225 lbs. of fluorine (diluted with 80% nitrogen).  Each trailer contains 8 tubes.  There is a maximum of 2 tube trailers on site any given time.  The fluorine generator consists in a system owned and operated by a contractor.  Regulated substance is stored in a 30 lbs of fluorine (diluted with 80 % nitrogen)\n\n\n\nThe covered process starts with the transfer of fluorine from the tube trailer through a manifold system which connects one cylinder at a time and transfers the chemical to three reactors.   Though each cylinder at the tube trailer may contain pressures of up to 2,450 psig, the unloading system regulates the pressure to approximately 45 psig for delivery to the reactor system. The system is configured with an excess flow valve to prevent catastrophic failure and release of fluorine. Fluorine from generator is directly sent to one of the reactors at a regulated pressure of 45 psig.\n\n\n\nThe area is provided with detection sensors, audible and visible alarms, in case of an inadvertent release. As per RMP requirements, an offsite consequence analysis identifying a Worst Case and an Alternative Release scenario was performed, to determine their potential for off-site impact. Other Alternative Release Scenarios were also studied, and one was selected for RMP registration purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTAPI Puerto Rico, Inc  is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.

The site has a strong maintenance program including calibrations, preventative maintenance inspections, etc.  The operators in the facility are experienced and well-trained.  Specific written procedures are used to ensure safety during operation of the process.  The site also maintains an Emergency Response procedure that provides measures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the unlikely event of a release of hazardous material.  The site is active in self-evaluation of its performance to ensure compliance with all safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\nNo accidents as defined by 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety includes an automatic regulator in the fluorine supply header."
