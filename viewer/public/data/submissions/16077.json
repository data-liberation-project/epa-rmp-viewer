      "SummaryText": "NSB in Kings Bay, Georgia is located in Camden County, Georgia, in the southeast corner of the state. The base can be accessed from Interstate 95 and Highway 40 at approximately 8 miles north of the Florida-Georgia border.\n\nThe mission of NSB Kings Bay is a combination of the missions of the six major tenant commands and several smaller tenants. The four basic functions of NSB Kings Bay are: Replenishment and maintenance support for Atlantic Fleet TRIDENT submarines and those commands and activities at NSB Kings Bay that provide direct support to TRIDENT submarines, operations support for both fleet and NSB Kings Bay activities, training support for Atlantic Fleet TRIDENT submarine crews and the commands and activities at Kings Bay that provide direct support to the TRIDENT submarines, and personnel support for all fleet and shore-based personnel directly engaged in support of Atlantic Fleet strategic operations at Kings Bay.\n\nNSB Kings Bay is deeply committed to chemical and environmental safety. NSB Kings Bay earned  the Secretary of the Navy Award for Environmental Quality in 1998, and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce presented the1999 Navy Environmental Leadership Award for Overall Environmental Leadership. This commitment is further exemplified by a full time safety staff, regular inspections of all facilities within the station, and strict adherence to applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the storage, handling and use of chemicals.  In addition, all activities at NSB Kings Bay are required to abide by stringent regulations (NAVOSH) adopted and enforced by the Navy.\n\nPer Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, NSB Kings Bay is submitting this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination processes at the Water Treatment Plant and at the Base Area Waste Water Treatment Plant (BAWWTP). The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the WTP is 10,000 pounds and 8,000 pounds at the BAWWTP. The chlorine is used for disinfection purposes at both locations"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nAs mandated by EPA, the worst-case release scenario (WRS) involves the catastrophic failure of one of the chemical containers at the facilities. Since both plants are located within 1,000 feet from each other, and WRS impacts from both locations would not affect different populations, only one WRS (WTP) is reported in the RMP. The resultant gas cloud will have offsite impacts. A catastrophic failure of a container is extremely unlikely due to the rigid DOT-mandated construction specifications of the container, and the Chlorine Institute requirements covering the refilling and inspections of containers (by the chemical supply company prior to delivery). Further, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place at the base provides protection from an external event which could lead to a catastrophic failure (i.e. fire). NSB Kings Bay has its own fully trained and capable fire department located within 0.25 mile from the plants.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) involves the release of a much smaller quantity of chlorine through a failure of the container valve. No public receptors were identified within the offsite vulnerable zone of the alternative release. \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents within the past five years at the plant.\n\nThe process is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which mandates a specific and detailed program to ensure the safe handling of hazardous substances. All operators are trained in the safe handling of chlorine, chemical safety is discussed at weekly safety meetings, the equipment is inspected on a daily basis, and a preventative maintenance program is in place. The system is equipped with alarms to monitor for leaks and alert the plant personnel to take corrective action. The system is also equipped with vacuum regulators, which would stop the supply of chemical at the container, thereby limiting the chemical release to a very small amount.\n\nNSB Kings Bay has an EPA-approved Facility Response Plan"

The plant EAP outlines procedures for the mitigation of minor leaks, details a notification process for emergency responders and the public. The base fire department personnel are trained in responding to chemical emergencies and have the specialized equipment to repair a leaking container. The base has mutual aid agreements with the surrounding community emergency departments and is included in the Community Emergency Response Plan (CERP), which is coordinated through the Camden County Fire Rescue Office.\n\nNSB Kings Bay is in the process of instituting several enhancements to its existing chemical safety program."
