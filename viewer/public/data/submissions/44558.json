Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR 68.150.\n\nThe Jonesville facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any offsite death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. In addition, the estimated flammable endpoint for a worst-case release is less than the distance to any public or environmental receptor. Furthermore, emergency response procedures have been coordinated between the facility and local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, Jonesville Gas Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\nJonesville is an unmanned facility. However, the facility is visited on a daily basis by facility's personnel to ensure proper operation and maintenance is performed.\n\nJonesville first submitted a RMP to USEPA in 2001. However, in September 2002, the facility suspended its operation. Jonesville did not start its operation again until July 2005 where the facility changed the process of NGL separation from natural gas stream. As a result, Jonesville must update and resubmit its RMP to USEPA. \n\nThe following information summarizes the Jonesville 2005 update and resubmission.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nJonesville maintains a policy of safe natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the extraction processes, an"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixtures that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at Jonesville is 30,000 gallons (159,329 lbs). \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nJonesville has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.180. Jonesville maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which provides guidance procedures for emergencies expected at the facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ERP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\nThe accident history for Jonesville was reviewed for the period of 5 years prior to December 2005.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of NGL occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Plan, which describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release. The facility has coordinated the emergency response and plan with the Harrison County LEPC and the Waskom Fire Department."
