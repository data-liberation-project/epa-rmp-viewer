It follows strict unloading procedures which include verification of all the necessary safety protocol and equipment, check-in with security and control, approval from control to unload, radio notification to control by driver, and thorough inspection of hoses, tanks, valves and safeties. Upon completion of the delivery, the driver presents the Novozymes contact with a copy of the completed \"delivery\" receipt.\r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the top of the tanks. While withdrawal the pressure in the tank is reduced and therefore liquid ammonia vaporizes to replace the gas space. Heat is required to accomplish this vaporization. If the heat from the surrounding air is not sufficient or can't flow through the tank fast enough to maintain the vaporizing rate, the pressure will drop. When this pressure drop closes the pressure switch electrical contacts, the heater(s) in the vaporizer is turned on to continue the heat supplement. Liquid ammonia flows out from the tank bottom into the vaporizer shell where it is converted to a gas. The gas then flows into the top of the tank where it can be withdrawn to satisfy the needs of the system.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous ammonia produced at the ammonia station is used as a source of nitrogen as a feed nutrient in the main fermentors.\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nNovozymes has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with haza"

Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams.  Additional training with outside organizations is also conducted.\r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\nNo planned changes to safety system have been identified at this time."
