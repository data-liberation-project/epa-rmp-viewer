Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Wonderful Citrus has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into each evaporator. Low temperature liquid circulates through each evaporator. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe Wonderful Citrus D1 facility was originally built in the 1998 by California Controlled Atmosphere and has been added to since that time.

One sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at a normal rate of 20 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe. The second sensor is set at 15,000 ppm, which will shut down all refrigeration machinery inside the refrigeration machinery room and activate an audible alarm and strobe.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Wonderful Citrus facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contains a total charge of approximately 39,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nWonderful Citrus' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\""

Nevertheless, Wonderful Citrus continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wonderful Citrus has also entered into a cont"
