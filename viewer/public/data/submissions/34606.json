      "SummaryText": "Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP), located in Brunswick County, produces electric power for retail distribution.  The plant operates two nuclear reactors for power generation.  The heat from the nuclear reactors is used to generate steam which drives the turbines.  Water which is used for cooling is treated with chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in a fenced-in section adjacent to the service water building.  Other components of the water treatment system are:  evaporators (5), chlorinators (5), and injectors (5).\n\nAt any given time, there can be a maximum of three chlorine rails cars at the facility.  These are not interconnected and are separated by a distance of several hundred yards.  Each rail car can potentially store chlorine in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Therefore, the rail car is the only process that is subject to the Risk Management Program regulations.  However, there are three potential locations at BSEP for the chlorine rail cars:\n\n1.  A single chlorine railcar is staged at the chlorination process and is used as a feed tank.\n\n2.  One or more chlorine cars are stored on a rail spur behind the warehouse several hundred yards from the chlorination process.\n\n3.  Railcars are stored for short periods in a locked holding pen near Bethel Church Road.\n\nThe storage of the railcar at the three separate locations constitute three processes since the railcars are not interconnected and are located such that a release at one location would not result in a potential release at another location.\n\nBrunwick Steam Electric Plant is subject to regulations enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  NRC regulatons require procedures and safe operating practices to minimize health and safety risks (to the employees as well as the public) resulting from exposure to radioactive material as well as other toxic/flammable materials.  With respect to safety inspection performed by an external agency (Item 1.15 of the RMP), as a licen"

      "SummaryText": "see, BSEP maintains NRC safety requirements.  Consequently, BSEP has developed procedures and safe operating practices for the handling of chlorine at the Plant.  These procedures and safe operating practices have resulted in no accidental release during the past five-year period which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  A process hazards analysis (PHA) conducted in July 1998 indicated that no changes were necessary.\n\nThe North Carolina Division of Air Quality conducted an audit of the RMP on May 25, 2004 using the \"North Carolina Division of Air Quality 112(r)  Inspection Checklist - 40 CFR Part 68,\" and the RMP was found to be in compliance."
