      "SummaryText": "The Indiantown Generating Plant is owned by Indiantown Cogeneration, LP (ICLP).  Our overall approach to chemical safety and security involves safe equipment design, well-trained employees & qualified contractors, and regular audits and assessments.\n\nICLP operates an electric and steam generating facility.  Pulverized coal is burned in two state-of-the-art boilers, and the steam is used to generate electricity.  \n\nWe store an aqueous ammonia solution, which is safer to handle than anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia solution is used in our air pollution control system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  ICLP has NOx emission rates that are among the lowest for any facility of its kind.\n\nICLP complies with the federal Risk Management Program (RMP).  The recent DOT HazMat guidelines are also adhered to at ICLP.  The general accidental release prevention program is incorporated into overall safe plant operation.  The plant is continuously staffed, with designated security personnel, perimeter fencing and controlled access/gate security.  The control room operators have access to real-time process monitor data plant-wide, and can take emergency action remotely (e.g. through remote shut-off valves).  Trained operators perform regular walk-through visual inspections of equipment.  In accordance with company policy, chemical unloading is supervised, and follows written procedures.\n\nICLP has taken several chemical-specific prevention steps to avert any accidental releases of ammonia.  Control room operators remotely monitor the status of the ammonia system.  A loss of ammonia flow would instantly cause an alarm in the control room, where trained operators would take immediate action to correct the problem.  The ammonia storage and handling system undergoes testing and preventative maintenance that meets or exceeds industry standards.  The ammonia storage is located inside a concrete secondary containment structure.  In the event of a catastrophic release, this struct"

      "SummaryText": "ure would prevent the spread of aqueous ammonia and slow the evaporation rate.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system has had no spills and no accidents since ICLP began operation in 1995.  \n\nICLP Generating has an Emergency Response Plan, which is coordinated with the Martin County Emergency Management Comm. Center.  Plant workers undergo annual hazardous materials safety training and emergency response training, as well as regular emergency drills.  Training includes an annual ammonia release drill with local responders.  Plant management has made concerted efforts to coordinate with local law enforcement, fire and emergency departments and other ?first responders? to ensure an appropriate response to an incident at the facility."
