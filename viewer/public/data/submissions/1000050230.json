As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, OG Packing and Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 OG Packing and Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that OG Packing and Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

All control valve groups are mounted on the roof (Building B, C, D, and E) or near the high side machinery area (Building A) to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within two (2) refrigeration machinery rooms, (1) outdoor high-side skid, and directly outside near the machinery rooms. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nSystem 1\n\n(3) High Pressure Receivers\n\n(2) Liquid Recirculators\n\n(2) Flooded Pit Accumulators\n\n(1) Liquid Transfer Vessel\n\n(2) FES Screw Compressors\n\n(2) Vilter Reciprocating Compressors\n\n(5) Evaporative Condensers\n\n(9) McCormack Ceiling Suspend"

From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulators. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to a main suction accumulator. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nSystem 2 operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped through a liquid feed solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into one of two liquid recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned "

In 1994, California Controlled Atmosphere was hired to supply and install the refrigeration equipment for System 2 (Building B). In 1997, California Controlled Atmosphere was hired to modify System 2 to provide refrigeration capacity to Building C/D. The system has been modified in numerous other instances since that time. Most recently, APEX was hired in 2014 to replace the System 2 high pressure receiver and APCCO was hired in 2015 to supply and calibrate ammonia sensors for the cold storage rooms.\n\n\n\nEach refrigeration system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank or atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Each entrance to a machinery room contains emergency refrigeration shutdown and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\n\nEach ammonia system at OG Packing and Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. The systems are not connected to each other, nor co-located such that a release from one system would impact the ability to operate the other systems.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, OG Packing and Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor "
