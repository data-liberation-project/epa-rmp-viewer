Crystal utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in its system.  This system has been built and maintained in compliance with all federal, state and local regulations with regard to the storage and use on anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with OSHA Process Safety management standards.  This process involves employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, training, pre-start up reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning, response and compliance audits.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases that involve off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Crystal has a trained emergency response team that has specific training in response to an ammonia release.  Our emergency response plan has been reviewed with and involves the local emergency planning agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is a on-going process at Crystal Distribution.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
