The information provided in the original submission was used by the City of Lawrence staff to complete the current resubmittal of the RMP.\n\nRelease prevention and emergency response policies\nPersonnel at this facility are active in maintaining and improving chemical safety.  This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use chlorine in ton containers.  The City's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, our policy is to notify the City of Lawrence Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nThis facility is a water treatment plant located in Lawrence, Kansas.  The facility employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: flocculation and sedimentation, disinfection, and final filtration processes.  The covered process is the disinfection of water using chlorine. The chlorine is provided through truck-delivered ton containers and the maximum intended inventory at the facility is 24,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 2 processes and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state and local laws and industry codes.  To achieve and maintain this compliance, the City has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves, and other safety systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "and, failing that, to minimize the effects of a release.\n\nFive-year accident history\nIn the last five years, this facility has not had an accident, involving chlorine, that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThe facility has a written emergency action plan that is coordinated with local emergency responders.  The Lawrence Fire Department is the primary responder.  City employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nThe emergency action plan includes emergency situation identification, procedures for reporting emergencies, evacuation, system shutdown, and responder notification.  The plan also addresses the interaction with the city fire department.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Safety training takes place throughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like the hazard review or made upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for implementation.  This feedback process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course."
