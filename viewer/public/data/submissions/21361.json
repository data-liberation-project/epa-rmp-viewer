All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak.  In the meantime, a steady spray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order: 911, the facility manager, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number, the MDEQ hotline and the MDA emergency phone number.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\n\n\nCommunication procedures with responders \nThe local fire department is invited to tour the Munson Farm Center on an annual basis.

      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Munson Farm Center RMP Executive Summary\n\n\nSource and Product Description:\nThe Andersons Munson Farm Center is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies.  This facility was purchased from The Metamora Elevator Company in the spring of 1995. The facility manager is Dave Creque\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 2 \u00bd acres and is situated just north of the village of Munson in Medina Township, Lenawee County.  The facility is located on the east side Munson Highway, north of Lawrence Street and south of the Norfolk Southern Railroad Line. There is one residence to the south side of the facility, about 30 yards away.  There are no adjacent neighbors to the east.  There are a couple of homes on the north, about a \u00bc mile away.  To the southwest, there are 15 houses and one church within 500 yards of the facility.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  A 16,500 gallon tank and a 30,000 gallon tank are used for bulk storage of  the material. These tanks are located approximately 50 feet and 65 feet, respectively, south of the railroad main line on the east side of the facility.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 131,325 total pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards:\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a"

      "SummaryText": "at the risk of a complete release of the tank contents is infinitesimally small.  Active mitigation systems in place at this facility were designed to prevent or mitigate any attempts to empty the tank.  The tank is in a protected location, and all transfer appendages are protected by concrete barriers.\n\nA more probable release situation is expressed by the alternative release scenario.  We believe that a more likely release could occur from a transfer hose failure.  Prior to the excess flow valve being activated, we estimate that the maximum amount of ammonia that could escape to the atmosphere is approximately 2575 pounds. A release of this nature would likely last for about five minutes.  Utilizing an average wind speed of 3.0 m/sec and atmospheric stability class D,  the resulting distance to endpoint would be  0.40 miles.   In this more realistic scenario, the only potential exposed receptors would be the few residences surrounding the facility - no more than 100 people.\n\nActive mitigation systems were included in the alternative case scenario.  They are listed in the next section.\n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented:\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  Passive mitigation systems in place at the Munson Farm Center are:\n\u00b7 Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a railcar or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n \n Active mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation systems in place at the Munson Farm Center are:\n\u00b7 Excess flow valves are located"

      "SummaryText": "on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00b7 Back check valves are located on the railcar / truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a railcar or truck from the storage tank.\n\u00b7 Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\u00b7 Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n\u00b7 An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tanks from 10,000 gallon and 15,000 gallon water tanks.  A nearby water well (120' away) could be utilized to provide water to knock down a vapor cloud.\n\u00b7 Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n\u00b7 Anderson personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program:\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the spring and fall season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhy"

      "SummaryText": "railcar or delivery truck to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the storage tanks to the small application tanks (aka nurse wagons).  Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled.  Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tanks can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s).  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks are built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks  are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards:\nThe worst case scenario for this facility was created using EPA's RMP Comp software.  A complete release of the largest tank's contents (approximately 120,000 pounds -- creating a gas / vapor cloud) in a 10 minute period, using worst case atmospheric conditions, results in a distance to endpoint of 5.6 miles.  The estimated exposed population is 5,000 people.  This distance would encompass the village of Munson, the cities of Fayette and Morenci, their schools and government offices.  No hospitals, prisons or sensitive environmental receptors would be affected.  There are no passive mitigation systems available for this type of scenario.\n\nIt is our belief th"
