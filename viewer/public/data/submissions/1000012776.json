Process Safety Management (PSM), and OAC Rules 3745-65-50 to 3745-65-56.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to follow the emergency procedures outlined in our Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The procedures in our EAP include notifying Cimcool security, our internal response team and, if necessary, the local fire department.\n\n(B)    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThis facilityA?s manufacturing processes include developing and mixing machine tool coolants.  The facility uses formaldehyde (37% solution) in its processes and manages the substance in less than 90-day tank storage quantities.\n\n(C)    Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:  \n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one storage tank resulting in the release of a toxic solution.  The total capacity of the storage tank is 10,000 gallons, however, it is limited to a maximum of 7,500 gallons through the implementation of administrative ordering and inventory controls.  The resulting distance to the endpoint of 0.3 mile extends offsite, and the receptors include manufacturing facilities, retail locations and residential areas.  Per Census 2000 data, the potentially affected offsite population is 160 people.\n  \nOur alternative release scenario is a break in a 3-inch diameter pipe, leading to a release of a toxic solution.  The resulting alternative case endpoint distance is 0.1 mile and does not extend offsite.  Per Census 2000 data, the potentially affected offsite population is zero.\n\n(D)    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPAA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The formaldehyde system is maintained in accordance wi"

Our manual was reviewed and updated in 2010.  \n\nThe manual is intended for the protection of the employees of Cimcool Industrial Products LLC and our neighbors surrounding our plant.  The plan ensures that the most efficient methods of response by certified individuals can take place during a possible incident.\nAmong other things, our plan covers arson and bomb threats, chemical spills, civil disturbances, fire/explosions, and first aid procedures.  The plan is also intended as a reference source to familiarize local emergency response agencies, fire and police departments, and area hospitals on operations related to operations at CimcoolA?s Oakley facility.\n\nIn the event of a chemical emergency at the Oakley facility, security personnel at the main entrance are notified immediately.  Security then notifies a trained Emergency Commander.  The Emergency Commander has complete authority to commit all resources of the company to carry out the Emergency Response Contingency Plan in the event of an emergency.  The contingency plan contains a contact list that includes all internal response managers, the fire department, and emergency response contractors.\n\n(G)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nThe lining in the existing formaldehyde tank is nearing the end of its design life.  Instead of simply replacing the lining, Cimcool plans to replace the entire existing tank (which is constructed of carbon steel) with a new unit constructed of stainless steel.  The new stainless steel unit will offer greater chemical resistance and a lower likelihood of failu"
