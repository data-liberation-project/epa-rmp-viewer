Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association, Humeston, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the purchase, storage, handling and sale of anhydrous ammonia for nitrogen fertilizer to local area farmers. It is stored in one (1) pressurized steel storage tank - 18,000 gallons (78,795 pounds) and 32 - 1,000 gallon pressuired steel nurse tanks (140,080 pounds).\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A) The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78,795 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 855 capacity as limited be design standards. The distance to the Endpoint (the point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 2.1 miles.  B) The Alternate Release Case Scenario,based on the Five Year Accident History or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 26,640  pounds. The distance to the Endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  the facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrou"

(ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor, to the best of our knowledge, has resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency response Program: The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required by SARA Title III (EPCRA)>\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
