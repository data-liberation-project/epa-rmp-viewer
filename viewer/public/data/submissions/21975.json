      "SummaryText": "community. \n\t\n\tThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen based on the criteria established in the regulation.  \n\t\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe stationary source is the APCI main production facility located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky.  The RMP covered processes are the Emulsions unit and the VAM storage and distribution unit.   \n\nIn the Emulsions unit, VAM is polymerized in water to polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), Ethylene and/or Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) may also be polymerized in water with or without VAM.  A number of other chemicals that are not covered by the RMP regulations, may be used to adjust the properties for specific end uses.  Emulsions products are used in many applications including adhesives, latex paints and paper coatings.  \n\nThe VAM storage and distribution area at the main production facility receives VAM from tanks at the Tennessee River and stores it on site to continuously supply the Emulsions production facilities and the Celanese PVOH production facility.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this stationary source is:\n\n\u00b7\tVinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 433,000 pounds\n\u00b7\tEthylene with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 237,000 pounds\n\u00b7\tVinyl Chloride with a maximum quantity in an individual process of 60,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \n\nThe Air Products and Chemicals plant at Calvert City has one RMP listed toxic liquid, Vinyl Acetate Monomer and two RMP listed flammables on site, Ethylene and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM).

      "SummaryText": "e than VCM, ethylene was chosen as the source for the flammable scenarios.  \n\nIn the plant, the greatest VAM inventory is contained in either of two storage tanks, FB-1510 and FB-1511.  Under worst case conditions of a single tank failure, the entire contents of the tank, 436,800 pounds of VAM would be released from the tank and be contained in an earthen dike around the tanks.  Using the EPA lookup tables for rural terrain, the vaporized VAM would spread to an endpoint that would exceed the plant boundaries.  Although there are active controls directed at preventing such a release and controlling the consequences, no credit was taken for active mitigation methods in evaluating the Worst Case Scenario.  \n\nThe alternative case for a toxic liquid at the plant is the leak of VAM from one of these storage tanks.  A line leak similar to a spill that occurred in October 1999 resulted in 33,500 pounds of VAM released into the earthen dike.  Using the EPA lookup tables and default weather conditions, the radius to the endpoint would not exceed the plant boundaries.  Even though EPA methodology would allow credit for active mitigation methods, no such credit was taken.  \n\nThe worst case RMP flammable scenario is the release of the contents of the liquid ethylene storage tank.  Ethylene is delivered to the plant in a railcar or tank truck and stored as a liquid under pressure.  Liquid ethylene storage capacity is administratively controlled to 90% of tank capacity or 237,400 pounds.  Under worst case conditions, a tank failure would release 237,400 pounds of ethylene.  The distance to a 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint would exceed plant boundaries using the EPA lookup tables.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario would be the failure of the 2 ethylene unloading hose.  Using the total contents of the railcar (138,500 lbs) under average weather conditions, an explosion would have an impact to an endpoint with off-site consequences.  Even though the EPA methodology would allow credit"

The safety systems associated with ethylene unloading work include an operator in constant attendance during unloading, two excess flow check valves for shutdown, vapor monitoring and alarm.  These and other safety measures would reduce the size of the release and the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nBecause VCM has less explosive energy and is stored in smaller quantities, VCM was not selected for any of the RMP scenarios or hazard assessments.  \n\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:  \n\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.  The hierarchy starts with the facility design and construction which is applicable to all design standards using qualified engineers and contractors.  A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels and piping.  These checks are done using nondestructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.  \n\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in environmental compliance.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown and emergency conditions.  Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.  \n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.  Process areas are covered by fire sensors and flammable vapor sensors, fire sprinklers systems, monitor nozzles, dry chemical extinguishers, etc.   Containment dikes around storage"

All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard reviews are conducted by multi-disciplinary teams.  \n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the plant and corporate levels.  These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and tracked through the plant management systems.  \n\n5.\tFive year accident history:\n\nNone of  the stationary sources or covered processes at the Air Products and Chemicals plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years that would be reported under RMP.  There have been no releases of VAM, ethylene or VCM that have had any off-site consequences, resulted in any employee injuries, or resulted in any significant equipment damage.  \n\n6.\tThe emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is operated jointly with its neighbor, Celanese Ltd., and is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  There are at least 16 trained emergency responders in the fire and rescue squad that are divided into shifts and day workers.  Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer.  In an emergency, the safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.  On-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck and ambulance.  In addition to these resources, APCI is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can count on pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.

The VAM storage tanks have no outstanding upgrade recommendations.  \n\nThe emergency notification and response systems are composed of a siren system that is activated by the 911operator backed up by the safety officer at Air Products.  In the event of an emergency, 911 would activate the sirens and voice control modules that are placed in public buildings such as the Convalescent Center, City Hall and the Calvert Elementary School.  Once a citizen has heard the siren, they are to turn their radio on the local Calvert City station (WCCK) and listen for specific instructions.  The sirens are routinely tested one day per month and training in the community has been ongoing for almost one year."
