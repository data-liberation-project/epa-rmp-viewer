We will maintain a safety and health program that conforms to the best practices of organizations similar to ours.  The objective of our safety and health program is to surpass the best experience of operations similar to ours.  Our goal is for every employee to embrace the \"zero-injury\" philosophy; that is, every accident that causes an injury or illness is preventable, and no accidents are acceptable to us.  \n\nOur preventative measures start prior to the introduction of any new chemical entering the facility.  Changes are reviewed at several levels including safety and environmental impacts.  Emphasis is placed on characterizing all incoming materials to determine the protective measures necessary to safely store and handle the material. No chemical substance enters or leaves our facility without written information that provides the hazardous properties and safe handling precautions for the substance.  Our storage and processing equipment is designed to safely contain and handle the materials used.  Design data and process evaluations are reviewed at multiple levels to ensure their completeness.  Our ongoing programs to inspect, maintain, and improve our processes are a testament to 3V's commitment to keep our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment safe.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe 3V, Inc. facility is located adjacent to the Sampit River, approximately 4.0 miles west of Highway 17 South on Woodstock Road in Georgetown County, South Carolina. The core business is dedicated to the batch production of organic specialty chemicals.

Various additives and solid materials are sometimes loaded into the reactors via portals or dump chutes.  The mixture is then reacted by manipulation of temperatures and pressures in the reaction vessel.  The resulting mixture is then transferred to downstream equipment where mechanical operations such as filtering, drying, and packaging are performed.  Any unreacted material is then recovered for reuse or treated and removed.  In general, the storage, transfer, and reaction steps are the most critical in terms of safety.  The majority of our final products are non-hazardous.\n\n\n\nThree of 3V's stored raw materials that are covered chemicals under the RMP program are acetaldehyde, sulfur trioxide and vinyl acetate. All materials are stored and processed in closed systems with protective alarms and features.  Through careful planning and controls, acetaldehyde has been handled safely for over 12 years.  The vinyl acetate system has been safely handled for over 28 years. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario For Process 1:\n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario for vinyl acetate was evaluated.  This scenario involved the failure of the storage tank, which contains the total inventory of vinyl acetate for the site.  The storage tank for vinyl acetate is located outside in a concrete containment structure.  EPA's model, RMPComp, was used to evaluate the distances to the toxic end points.  Even though the endpoint is located beyond the facility boundary, there are no offsite receptors (houses, churches, schools, etc.) located within that distance.   \n\n\n\nAlternate Toxic Release Scenario For Process 1:\n\nThe alternate toxic release scenario was evaluated for vinyl acetate.

Again, the end points of such an event extend beyond the facility boundary but do not reach any receptors. The closest house is more than five times the distance from the facility as the worst case end point.  The alternate release scenario for this material is a release from the same vessel, but assumes that the tank is half full and the failure of the tank is through a 3-inch opening.  In this case the distance to an end point is within the facility boundary. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario For Process 2:\n\nThe worst case toxic release scenario for sulfur trioxide was evaluated.  This scenario involved the failure of the storage tank, which contains the maximum total inventory of sulfur trioxide in the vessel and for the site.  The storage tank for sulfur trioxide is located outside in a concrete containment structure.  EPA's model, RMPComp, was used to evaluate the distances to the toxic end points.

Smoking is prohibited throughout the facility.  Hot work must be conducted by permit only and not in the presence of combustible materials.  Process equipment and storage tanks containing flammable liquids are grounded and inerted with nitrogen and equipped with flame arrestors.  Oxidizers and organic peroxides are segregated from combustible and flammable liquids.  Signs are posted at the entrance to the facility prohibiting smoking, matches or open flames.  Facility personnel inspect process vessels, pumps and piping systems routinely for leaks. Temperatures, pressures and levels are monitored at appropriate intervals on tanks and process equipment. Containment structures exist around tanks and process units containing hazardous materials to contain spills should they occur.  These structures are inspected routinely and deficiencies are addressed as they are discovered.  Storage tanks containing flammable or toxic liquids are provided with nitrogen blankets to remove oxygen, vent controls to avoid over or under pressurization, and safety devices to protect the tank from failure.

These guidelines assure that the tanks will not over-pressurize under emergency conditions. Some of the specific methods that we use for accident prevention include the following:\n\n* Inerting - oxygen is purged from tanks, pipes, and process equipment with nitrogen to eliminate the potential for a flammable atmosphere.  Under inert conditions, flammable vapors cannot ignite.\n\n* Grounding - storage and process systems are grounded and tested to prevent static discharges, which are a potential ignition source.\n\n* Venting - storage tanks and process vessels have emergency venting systems to prevent vessel ruptures, explosions, and structural damage in an over-pressure situation.\n\n* Alarms - storage tanks and process vessels have various alarms to warn personnel when an operating parameter (i.e. level, temperature, pressure) has deviated out of its safe range. \n\n* Temperature Control - Acetaldehyde is stored at reduced temperature to reduce its vapor pressure, thereby reducing the likelihood of a significant vapor release from the storage and transfer systems.\n\nThe storage system for sulfur trioxide has been designed in accordance with recommendations from the supplier, DuPont.  It has been inspected prior to first shipment by a DuPont reprersentative to confirm that the installation is safe for storage of sulfur trioxide.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no reportable accidents associated with our regulated chemicals or their associated processes.
