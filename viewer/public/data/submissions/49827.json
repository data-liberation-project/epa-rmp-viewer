      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe following provides a brief summary of the key components of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Cedar Bayou Electric Generating Station.\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nCedar Bayou Electric Generating Station is located in Eldon, Texas.  The facility is a 2,300-MW electric generation facility powered by three high-pressure boilers, which produce steam for generation of electricity.  Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems are installed on CBY1 and CBY2.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Cedar Bayou is comprised of storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The two tanks each have a capacity of 30,000 gallons, and each tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve, a vacuum breaker valve with flame arrestor, and liquid level indicators.  \n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nA five-year accident history is not applicable yet. The SCR system on CBY2 began service on 2/6/04 and the SCR system on CBY1 was certified on 6/20/05.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nCedar Bayou is covered by an accidental release prevention program, which includes the following:\n\u00bf\tPeriodic hazard review and updates\n\u00bf\tPeriodic audits of the system and its operation\n\u00bf\tEmergency response plan coordinated with local responding agencies\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components:\n\u00bf\tComprehensive plan covering all components of the aqueous am"

Cedar Bayou employees have been trained in this plan and would be the first responders in the event of an emergency. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Cedar Bayou was conducted as part of this RMP.  This is a new process, and there are not any planned changes to the system at this time."
