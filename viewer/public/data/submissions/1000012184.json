Each ditch has a capacity of 2.4 million gallons.  The oxidation ditch type of treatment is an aerobic process.  Aerobic means that air is mechanically placed into the wastewater to enable the aerobic bacteria to break down the solids into a non-harmful, useful substance.  Each ditch has three channels.  The wastewater enters the ditch in the outside channel.  The wastewater is mixed with the water that is already in the ditch and is aerated by the use of several round rollers that have flat paddles on them.  These paddles slap the water which causes air to be injected, and also keeps the wastewater circulating so the solids will not settle out in the ditch.  From the time the wastewater enters the outside channel it takes approximately 8 hours for it to make its way to the inside channel where it leaves the ditch by way of weirs.\n\nAfter flowing over the oxidation ditch weirs, the wastewater flows by underground pipe to the final clarifers.  The wastewater enters the clarifers in the center and as it flows toward the outside V notch weirs the solids are allowed to settle out of the water.  The clear, solids-free water then flows to the effluent Parshall Flume.  The solids that settle out of the wastewater are moved to the inside of the clarifers by means of mechanical scrapers that are continually moving the solids back toward the center of the clarifers where it is removed to the sludge pumping station by way of telescopic valves.\n\nOnce at the return sludge pump station, the solids are either pumped back to the oxidation ditches or to the digester.  The solids in the ditches are called mixed liquor suspended solids.  These solids contain the microorganisms that breakdown or eat the solids in the raw wastewater.  They are returned to the ditches in order to maintain an acceptable mixed liquor suspended sol"

This means that in the event of a chlorine leak, approximately 55 percent of the chlorine leaked will be able to reach the outside atmosphere.\n\nThe worse-case release scenerio for the DBWWTP would be to have a tank rupture and release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  Because of the mitigation, being inside of an enclosure, only 55 percent or 1,100 pounds of chlorine would be released to the atmosphere.  If this kind of situation were to happen, the chlorine alarm at the chlorine building would sound and alert the operator on duty.  Once alerted the operator would immediately go to the chlorine building to visually confirm a leak.  If the operator determines that there is a chlorine leak he/she would follow the DBWWTP's Emergency Response Plan for the correct action(s) to take.\n\nIn the event of a worse-case scenerio, everyone within a radius of 0.9 miles of the DBWWTP would need to be evacuated.  This action would be handled by the Emergency Management Agency for the Town of Greeneville and would mean that approximately 150 people would need to be evacuated.  However, given the lay of the land and the location of the chlorine building at the DBWWTP, the chlorine gas, which is more dense and therefore heavier than air, would more than likely follow the creek bed until it dissipated to the point of being non-harmful to humans or the environment.\n\nThe alternative release scenerio for a chlorine leak at the DBWWTP would mean a release of 200 pounds or less of chlorine gas.

There are presently 12 employees working three shifts at the DBWWTP.  The Greeneville Water Commission continues to take an aggressive position relative to chemical safety.  We filed an Emergency Response Plan because we are required to have a Process Safety Program by TOSHA and we have chlorine on site in excess of the threshold limits as defined by the Emvironmental Protection Agency.\n\nWastewater is transported to the DBWWTP by a collection system which consists of 24 lift stations and several hundred miles of sewer pipes.  When the wastewater arrives at the DBWWTP it is raised or lifted up and dumped into a channel so that it will travel through the treatment plant by gravity.  This is done in order that the wastewater does not have to be mechanically moved from one treatment to another.\n\nAfter being placed/dumped into the influent channel the wastewater goes through a mechanical bar screen.  This step is to remove any large object(s) that might cause damage to the equipment or piping within the plant.  From here the wastewater goes through a Parshall Flume which is a smooth sided device that will not impede the wastewater flow.  The Parshall Flume has an ultrasonic meter that sends a signal down to the surface of the wastewater stream, where it is bounced back to the meter so the flow can be calculated and converted into million gallons per day.  These calculations are based upon the depth of the waste stream going through the flume at the time.  Once converted the results are electronically relayed to a flow recorder and chart inside the administration building.  Next the wastewater flows into the grit chamber where air is introduced into the wastewater in such a way as to cause grit, such as sand and gravel, to settle out of the wastewater where it can be mechanically removed so it will not accumulate in the plant"

These microorganisms are continually going through a cycle of breaking down solids in the wastewater, leaving the ditches and going to the clarifers where they are settled out of the water, going to the return sludge pumping station, and being returned to the ditches where they can begin the process again.\n\nWhen the mixed liquor suspended solids in the ditches goes above what is acceptable, the solids are removed from the cycle by being pumped from the return sludge pumping station to the digester.  In the digester the solids or sludge is aeriated and then allowed to settle.  When the solids have settled out, the water on the top is removed by way of valves at different levels on the digester and returned to the grit chamber where it flows back into the plant.  The air is then turned back on in the digester and as more solids need to be removed from the cycle they are pumped into the digester, the air is turned off, the solids are allowed out, the water is removed and returned to the plant, and the air is turned back on.  This process is repeated until the solids content of the digester sludge gets to the point that it needs to be removed.  The sludge is then fed into a tank called the thickener where it settles even more, with the water from the top being returned to the plant.\n\nSludge is removed from the thickener into the dewatering building where it is pumped into the centrifuge.  As the sludge enters the centrifuge, it is mixed with a polymer that acts as a solids magnet and helps separate the solids from the water at an accelerated rate.  The solids are then slung to the outside wall of the centrifuge where it is removed by scrapers and empted onto a conveyor belt that is located below the centrifuge.  After having the solids removed, the water from the centrifuge process is returned to the plant.  The sludge is carried by the conveyor belt and discharged into a sludge"

When the water leaves the Parshall Flume it enters the outfall line that carries it to the receiving stream, in our case, the Nolichuckey River at mile 47.5.  Immediately prior to entering the outfall line, chlorine gas is injected into the water to destroy pathogenic organisms, which are disease producing organisms in warm blooded animals.\n\nThe DBWWTP is currently using an average of 40 pounds of chlorine per day to treat a flow of approximately 3.5 MGD (3,500,000 gallons per day).  The chlorine is contained in one ton cylinders which are stored in a building located at the lowest point at the wastewater treatment plant.  There are usually three full one ton cylinders on site at any time.  The tank that is open is the one that we feed from.  The chlorine tanks are pressurized and the chlorine is used in its gaseous state.  The chlorine gas leaves the chlorine tank and travels through the chlorine feeders and into the injectors.  The chlorine gas then enters the water stream.\n\nChlorine must have an adequate contact time to insure that the harmful pathogens are destroyed.  The outfall line from the DBWWTP to the receiving stream is long enough, approximately 3 miles, to allow for the necessary contact time.  For this reason a chlorine contact chamber was not needed at the DBWWTP.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine residual in milligrams per liter (mg/l) that is allowable in the water that is discharged into our receiving stream is 0.52 mg/l.  This is the maximum limit that is allowed by our current National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES Permit.

The first is the Emergency Response Plan for the DBWWTP which spells out what action(s) are to be taken in the event of a chlorine gas leak and who is to take the action(s).  If any leaks are detected we have a two man emergency response team designated to respond.  The two members of our emergency response team will perform any needed repairs while their backup, which will consist of a two member team from the Greeneville Fire Department are outside on standby.  The Emergency Response Plans are included in the written response plan of the Town of Greeneville's Emergency Management Agency.  Training and drills for all DBWWTP employees are arranged and provided by the Greeneville Water Commission to ensure that leaks will not occur, but in the event one should occur, employees would be able to respond to it, both efficiently and safely, to better protect the public.
