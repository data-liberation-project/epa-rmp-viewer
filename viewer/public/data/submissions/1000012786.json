GFS has developed in conjunction with the Kent County LEPC a Chemical Emergency Response Plan & Standard Operating Procedures (Emergency Response Plan) for GFS's Grand Rapids Campus.  The stated purpose of this Emergency Response Plan is:\n* To ensure the safety of Emergency Response Team Personnel during a hazardous materials emergency.\n* To provide adequate safety precautions in protecting Gordon Food Service employees and the public from harm caused by a chemical release.\n* To provide the Emergency Response Team with management direction during all operations directly related to a hazardous material emergency.\n\nGFS has developed and trained a HAZMAT team, in accordance with all applicable OSHA regulations; to implement their established policies and the procedures established in this Emergency Response Plan.  The HAZMAT team is supported and sufficient resources have been provided to this HAZMAT team by GFS's upper management.\nSite Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nGordon Food Service (GFS) distributes general grocery items to restaurants, cafeterias, and Marketplace stores throughout the Midwest.  GFS utilizes refrigerated warehouses (Distribution Centers) to receive product from venders, which is then distributed to Marketplace stores and clients within a 250-mile radius.  GFS's Grand Rapids facility consists of Corporate Offices, a Fleet Maintenance Building, and two Distribution Centers and is collectively called the GFS Grand Rapids Campus.  The two Distribution Centers will be identified throughout the RMP as 50th Street Distribution Center and Clay Avenue Distribution Center.  Since the 50th Street Distribution Center and Clay Avenue Distribution Center are located on contiguous property, have the same industrial group and are both owned by GFS, only one RMP is required for this facility.\n\nThe structure of both Distribution Centers consists of a warehouse building subdivided to house building maint"

Refrigerated and frozen inventory cooling at both Distribution Centers is provided by two separate anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems located within each Distribution Center.  The storage and use of the anhydrous ammonia is the only substance used by GFS that is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The ammonia refrigeration systems at the distribution facilities contain the following:  \n* 50th Street Distribution Center: 10,080 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, and\n* Clay Avenue Distribution Center: 23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nBoth refrigeration systems consist of the following basic elements:\n* compressors,\n* high pressure receiver,\n* liquid chiller,\n* heat exchanger,\n* condensers, and \n* associated piping and valves.\n\nRefer to the attached process flow diagram for further design of the refrigeration systems at both Distribution Centers.  The refrigeration systems for both Distribution Centers are closed loop systems. \n\nAmmonia System Design - 50th Street Distribution Center\nAll components of the refrigeration system at the 50th Street Distribution Center are located within the warehouse facility itself except for the high-pressure receiver (largest single anhydrous ammonia storage vessel within refrigeration system), condensers, and associated piping and valves.  The high-pressure receiver, condensers and associated piping and valves are located on the roof of the warehouse building.  The remaining components of the system except for the chillers are housed in a concrete block room (compressor room) within the warehouse.  The compressor room has only one access point that opens into the warehouse itself.

One access point is a door that opens into the warehouse itself and the second access point is a door that leads directly to the outside of the facility that remains continuously locked from the inside.  The limited access to the compressor room essentially contains the refrigeration system and acts as containment in the event of a release.  \n\nThe chillers are suspended from the ceiling of the warehouse throughout the refrigerated and frozen food product areas.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint\".  Basically, a worst-case release is a catastrophic event that destroys the process and/or storage vessels and immediately releases all stored materials.  \n\nIn order to determine the impact of a worst case accidental release of ammonia to off-site receptors (public), an offsite consequence analysis was conducted.  RMP*Comp(tm), developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was the model utilized to determine the potential area of impact a worst case accidental release of ammonia could cause.  GFS modeled both Distribution Centers to assess which refrigeration system created the greatest area of impact.  The greatest quantity of ammonia is stored in the High Pressure Receiver at both Distribution Centers therefore; the quantity of ammonia stored in this vessel was the quantity utilized to model the worst case scenario.

The following site-specific parameters and required default parameters were utilized to conduct the offsite consequence analysis for the 50th Street Distribution Center:\n* Quantity of ammonia liquefied under pressure: 10,080 pounds (present in the high-pressure receiver located on the rooftop of the 50th Street Distribution Center (site-specific value)\n* Height of Release:  ground level (default value)\n* Release Duration: 10 minutes (default value)\n* Mitigation Measures:  None (default value)\n* Topography: Urban Surroundings (site-specific value)\n* Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (default value)\n* Stability Class: F (default value)\n* Air Temperature: 77 degrees Fahrenheit (default value)\n\nThese site specific values and default values were input into the RMP*Comp(tm) model to calculate the Toxic Endpoint and Estimated Distance to the Toxic Endpoint.  The calculated results are 0.14 mg/L and 1.2 miles, respectively.  \n\nIn order for a release of this magnitude to occur, all automated and engineered fail-safe mechanisms would have to have been destroyed also.  Basically, a catastrophic event like a tornado or earthquake would have to destroy the High Pressure Receiver instantaneously to meet the assumptions required by a worst case scenario (i.e. release all contents of a vessel in 10 minutes).\n\nThis model also assumes that the release occurs at ground level which is not an accurate representation of the site.  The High Pressure Receiver at the 50th Street Distribution Center is located on the roof approximately 45 feet above the ground.  In actuality, the ammonia vapor cloud that would form when a release occurred would dissipate in the direction of the wind predominantly west southwest, before sinking to ground level.

The Process Hazard Analysis conducted in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 indicated that a release caused by damage to the site glass valve located adjacent to the High Pressure Receiver on the roof of the 50th Street Distribution Center has a higher probability of occurring than a catastrophic event destroying the storage vessel.  If this valve was struck by an object (i.e. a bird or anything carried by a strong wind) the site glass valve could be damaged and cause a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Under normal operating conditions, this valve has a gauge pressure of 175 psig.  The alternate release scenario was calculated assuming the site glass valve was damaged creating a 1.5 inch hole (diameter of the valve).  The release rate was calculated utilizing the Bernoulli Equation:\nQR = HA x (203)(Pg)1/2\nWhere:    QR = Release rate (pounds/minute)\n    HA = Hole area (square inches)\n    Pg = Gauge pressure (psig)\n\nUsing this equation, the release rate was calculated to be 4,028 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per minute.  Inputting the calculated release rate of 4,028 pounds/minute and the default release duration of 60 minutes into the RMP*Comp(tm) model, an estimated distance to the Toxic Endpoint was calculated to be 0.4 miles.  This radius of impact is significantly smaller than the worst case scenario however; it could still impact the surrounding public.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario model assumes that all of the engineered fail safe measures present in the ammonia refrigeration system at GFS including automatic and manual alarms and shutoff mechanisms fail.

GFS has made a commitment to understand the environmental aspects and safety aspects of the refrigeration system operations.  In response to this increased knowledge and awareness, GFS has devoted much time and effort to insuring the refrigeration systems at each Distribution Center are working efficiently, effectively, and safely for not only on-site employees but also the residents and public areas surrounding the Distribution Centers.  GFS is subject to the OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) requirements.  Therefore, the PSM program GFS has instituted is in compliance with these standards, at minimum.  GFS's prevention program includes the following:\n* Daily manual and automated pressure checks of temperature and pressures in engine room.\n* Weekly inspection of exterior insulation, valve stations, and piping runs.\n* Bi-weekly leak checks of all valves and valve stations.\n* Preventative maintenance program based on observations from inspections.\n* Inspections of Preventative Maintenance Work Orders and daily/weekly inspections to ensure they are completed properly and in a timely fashion.\n* Utilization of a software system (Maximo) to assist GFS in monitoring the preventative maintenance program for both Distribution Centers.\n* Systematically upgrading refrigeration system equipment and components.\n* Installation of Industrial Refrigeration Thermal Insulation as a vapor barrier system to all refrigeration vessels, valves, piping, and fittings including hot gas lines to the defrost/condensing "

The Training Program includes both on-site and off-site training seminars through the University of Wisconsin, the Manufacturer (Vilter and Frick) and training modules and competency tests developed and supplied by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  Training is completed by each Refrigeration Technician on an annual basis.  \nFive-Year Accident History\nWithin the past 5 years no releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system had occurred at either facility. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nGFS has developed an extensive Emergency Response Program to respond to a chemical release from the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the 50th Street and Clay Avenue Distribution Centers.  GFS has developed in conjunction with the Kent County LEPC an Emergency Response Plan for GFS's Grand Rapids Campus.  The Emergency Response Plan details:\n* pre-emergency planning procedures, \n* GFS's Emergency Response Team organizational structure, \n* training requirements, \n* emergency recognition and prevention procedures, \n* emergency alerting procedures, \n* evacuation procedures, \n* emergency medical services, \n* emergency response procedures, \n* medical su"

GFS has provided not only employee training but all necessary resources needed to adequately, quickly, and safely respond to and mitigate a release of anhydrous ammonia.  An Emergency Response Trailer has been created and equipped with personal protective equipment, first aid equipment, and two-way radios.  The Equipment in this trailer is maintained in \"ready\" condition at all times.  \n\nAdditionally, GFS has coordinated with the Wyoming Fire Department, the Wyoming Police Department, area hospitals and local emergency response companies to ensure all parties are aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event a release does occur. GFS has established protocol to bring in the local authorities and inform the surrounding public when an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia exceeds 100 pounds.  By the direction of the Kent County LEPC, off-site notification comes from the Local Fire Department.  Upon their contact they assume the leadership role for emergency response and make all off-site evacuation and sheltering communications to the community.\n\nGFS employees required to do work in and around the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems, are trained and annually updated in accordance with the MIOSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Standard, Michigan Administrative Code R325.52101et seq.  These training programs include:\n* First Responders at the Awareness Levels\n* Hazardous Materials Technicians, and\n* On Scene Incident Commander.\n\nTo ensure response procedures and employee training is complete and up to date, GFS conducts mock emergency response scenarios on a quarterly basis.  After completing each mock emergency response scenario the HAZMAT Team reviews the methods and procedures followed to coordinate the response effort and mitigate a release to assess the"

These changes have increased the safety for all on-site employees and significantly reduced the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia from not only occurring but also from migrating off-site and impacting the surrounding residences and businesses.  GFS is committed to continually improve the operations of the refrigeration system to continue to reduce the threat of a release occurring from these two systems.  The changes proposed for the immediate future include but are not limited to:\n* Continually enhancing the Employee Training Program to allow GFS to obtain the best available information and technology for improving refrigeration system efficiency and safety,\n\nGFS is considering adopting the principles and management characteristics of an ISO 14000 Environmental Management System to manage environmental, health and safety compliance issues consistently throughout GFS's diversified organization.  An Environmental Management System is a proactive voluntary initiative that a company commits itself to going beyond compliance.  This system will allow Gordon Food Service to seek additional improvements in their effort to manage, control and potentially eliminate the risks associated with GFS's daily operational tasks.  \n\n"
