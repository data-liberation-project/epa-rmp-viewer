Old information such as \"date of last compliance audit\" that are not applicable to this new owner, have been deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolmes Smokehouse, located in Lufkin, Texas, processes sausage and packages meat products. The ammonia refrigeration system is a utility system supporting the plant by providing space conditioning and product cooling for meat processing, raw and finished products. The system also provides cooling to generate chilled water through a flooded heat exchanger. Ammonia contained within the refrigeration system is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations. At Holmes Smokehouse the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nHolmes Smokehouse is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.\n\n\n\n If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection via the San Antonio Fire Department. \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nHolmes Smokehouse has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by the EPA regulations, including an extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the single la"

Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected.\n\n\n\nThis type of release is not considered credible from the standpoint that an event of this nature would require the catastrophic failure of the container, resulting in a sudden release of the entire contents over a ten minute period. The ammonia system components are designed to withstand pressures well in excess of normal operating conditions and Holmes Smokehouse maintains a very rigorous maintenance and prevention program for all ammonia process equipment.\n\n\n\nIn fact, EPA release reporting databases and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning. A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario, formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance, was selected as the Holmes Smokehouse alternative release scenario. This scenario involves a one-inch diameter hole from a break in the high pressure liquid ammonia piping on the roof of the facility. Results of this credible worst-case event indicate that there are some offsite receptors that would be affected.\n\n\n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHolmes Smokehouse is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance. Based on this commitment, the Plant Maintenance Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program and has clearly defined "
