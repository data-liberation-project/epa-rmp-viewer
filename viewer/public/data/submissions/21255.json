Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.  The Honeywell Geismar Site endeavors to accomplish this by sponsoring and regularly meeting with established local Community Advisory Panels. Honeywell's Geismar site participates in community advisory panels for both Ascension and Iberville Parishes.\n\n2. Plant Description\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site is located primarily in Ascension Parish on the Mississippi River at Mile 187.0 and is bounded by highways 75, 3115 and 30. Honeywell shares the site with three other chemical manufacturing facilities.  The area is predominately rural with adjacent and nearby chemical manufacturing facilities. There are no immediate residential neighbors.  The plant employs approximately 180 company and about 90 contract workers.\n\nThe Honeywell Geismar Site's three covered processes manufacture new generation ozone friendly refrigerants, inorganic acids and fluoropolymer resin. The Hydrogen Fluoride Plant manufactures hydrogen fluoride.  The Multiproducts Plant manufactures 1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane (HFC 134a), pentafluoroethane (HFC 125) and 1-chloro-1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124).  The Aclon Resin Plant manufactures fluoropolymer resin.\n\nHFC 134a is used as a refrigerant in automotive applications.  HFC 125 is used as a refrigerant in residential air conditioners and commercial refrigeration units such as supermarket freezers, display cases and ice machines.  HCFC 124 is used in medical sterilants, rigid foam insulation manufacturing and in medium temperature refrigeration blends.\n\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a raw material in the manufacture of refrigerants, fluorocarbons, and gasoline as well as other chemical derivatives.  Aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride are used in the manufacture of electronic components and circuit boards, steel, high "

Because the Geismar site stores and uses hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, trifluorochloroethylene and 1,1 - difluoroethylene in more than the threshold quantities specified in the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation the site is covered by the regulation.\n\n3.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Geismar Site to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by\n\n* identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; \n* designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; \n* conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and \n* establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of hydrogen fluoride, oleum, chlorine, trifluorochloroethylene and 1,1 - difluoroethylene involves \n\n* the integration of safety programs, devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, \n* safe operational procedures and management practices, \n* operator training, \n* the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, \n* the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment, and \n* a professionally trained Emergency Response Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community.\n \nThe Geismar site has a well established Process Safety Management System and Health Safety and Environment Management System (HSE MS).

The site's emergency brigade personnel are regularly trained to maintain a high level of readiness and expertise. Drills are routinely held within the plant, with adjacent manufacturing facilities and with local agencies.  The plant participates in hazardous materials response activities with local public safety agencies.\n\nThe site maintains its own fire truck and ambulance.  Certified medical first responders are present onsite at all times.  A plant nurse maintains the plant's medical clinic during normal business hours.\n\nThe plant has provided medical treatment information on plant hazardous materials to local health, public safety and emergency response organizations.  The plant has conducted familiarization activities with local medical facilities.\n\n4.  Worst Case and alternative release scenarios and administrative and mitigation controls are in place to limit the impact of a release.\n \nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the Honeywell Geismar site to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulation.  EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during infrequent weather conditions which would inhibit dispersion of any vapor cloud.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addit"

The offsite consequences for each identified scenario were modeled pursuant to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for toxic chemicals was identified as a release of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The largest anhydrous hydrogen fluoride storage vessel is a horizontal, cylindrical steel tank located in an outdoor tank park in the hydrogen fluoride plant.  The elevated tank is located within the designated process containment for the process area.  The tank's actual maximum operational storage content is 720,000 pounds.  This is intentionally below the tank's maximum design capacity.  The release and meteorological parameters used for the worst-case release scenario for the hydrogen fluoride source were those defined and pre-set by EPA in the RMP Rule for toxic gases.  The occurrence of the specified release and meteorological conditions, either individually or concurrently, is considered extremely unlikely.\n \nIn accordance with the Rule, the maximum 720,000 lb. full capacity contents of the vessel were assumed to be released as a vapor at a constant rate over a 10-minute period.  The methodology recommended in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document was used to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen fluoride vapors before the concentration of the vapors decreased to an endpoint concentration of 0.016 milligrams per liter of air.

Under these unlikely release assumptions, this hypothetical release would have an impact beyond the boundaries of the Geismar site and would reach public receptors during meteorological conditions specified by EPA for RMP worst case scenarios.  The Geismar site has numerous programs, systems and controls in place which make the occurrence of the described worst case scenario extremely unlikely.  These systems and controls are described elsewhere in this document. \n\nThe worst case scenario for flammable chemicals was identified as a release of trifluorochloroethylene in the Aclon Resin Plant.  The contents of the tank were assumed to be released instantaneously to the atmosphere followed by a vapor explosion.  There would be no offsite impact from this release.\n\nBecause of the safety systems and prevention programs in place, the site focussed emergency planning resources on release scenarios which, although unlikely, represent some potential for occurrence.

Prompt activation of the water spray mitigation system would greatly reduce the impact of the release.  EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance indicates that vapor concentrations would decrease to less than 0.016 milligrams per liter of air beyond the boundary of the Geismar site.  Public receptors within the affected area include adjacent chemical manufacturing facilities, a railroad and a state highway.\n\nb) Chlorine \n\nAn evaluation of the Multiproducts Plant's use and handling of chlorine was conducted to identify an alternate release scenario.  Chlorine is injected into the plant's cooling towers.  The injection rate is controlled by a rotameter, a metering device with a calibrated glass tube through which the injection rate is measured.  A break of this tube was judged as the alternate release scenario.  It was estimated that about 5 pounds of chlorine would be released in 10 minutes.  Plant operations personnel or emergency response personnel would secure the release.\n\nEPA's Offsite Consequence Ana"

The Geismar site's five year accident history:\n \nA review of the facility's incident records for significant events involving chemicals covered by the RMP rule was conducted.  Consideration was given to the amount of material released, injuries which may have occurred, and actual or potential impact both on and off the facility. Two incidents involving an affected chemical occurred at the Honeywell Geismar Site in the past five years.\n\n1. In 1994, during reactivation of the site's refrigerants manufacturing process, a small amount of hydrogen fluoride was released from an instrument flange on a process vessel.  One employee was injured.  Operations personnel immediately activated the plant's water spray mitigation system and directed the sprays to absorb and disperse the vapors.  The employee fully recovered.  No offsite impact was observed.\n\nA thorough incident investigation was conducted.  Changes in maintenance and reactivation procedures were made to prevent recurrence.\n\n2. In 1999, maintenance was being performed on a heat exchanger in the hydrogen fluoride process.  The heat exchanger is normally under vacuum.  A minor process upset occurred which created a slight positive pressure causing a small amount of vapor to escape.  A worker received a minor chemical burn as he exited the area.  The worker was wearing personal protective equipment which limited his exposure.  The impact of this release was limited to the process structure.  No offsite impact occurred.  The worker was treated and released and returned to work.\n  \nA thorough incident investigation was conducted.  Changes in operation and maintenance procedures were made to prevent recurrence.\n\n7.

The site has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to accidental releases.  The Plan provides for both internal site and external community emergency alerting and notification using established protocols.  The plant has multiple means of communication established to alert public safety agencies.  The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response, control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Site's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the local emergency planning committee and with the local sheriff's agencies that would direct all offsite community response activities.  The Honeywell Geismar site maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases.  The ERT holds annual site emergency response drills and other exercises that have been conducted jointly with the local public safety response groups. \n\nThe Geismar site utilizes audible warning systems for both onsite and offsite notification.  The onsite notification system can be activated at several locations including control rooms and the plant security gate.  This system has siren and voice capability that can use prerecorded or live announcements.  The system is tested weekly and during routine drills by Honeywell and other companies which share the site.\n\nNotification of persons off the site property is accomplished in conjunction with the local public safety agencies by activation of a regional audible warning system.
