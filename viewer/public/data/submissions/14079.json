Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 11,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Bar-S Foods Elk City, OK.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Bar-S Foods Elk City, OK facility.\n\n3.0  Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n3.1  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe high pressure receiver, located inside the Engine Room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This vessel is typically maintained at less than 40% full.  However, during some shutdown operations, this vessel is used for pumping down the system.  During these operations, this vessel could be fill to approximately 88% capacity or 6,700 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 114 psig and 70 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe EPA Ammonia Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Endpoint Tables predicted, with a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 1.5 miles from the point of release (Rural Topogra"

Approximately 1200 people, as determined by Landview Census data, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A number of schools fall within the radius to the toxic endpoint.  Elk City Municipal Airport also resides within the radius to the toxic endpoint.  There are no environmental receptors, as reportable by EPA RMP criteria, within the radius to the toxic endpoint. \n\n3.2  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate Case, more likely, Release Scenario for Bar-S Foods Elk City, OK facility was selected to involve a relief valve release on a condenser.  The relief valve discharges on top of the Engine Room roof.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators onsite, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.\n\nThe EPA OCA Endpoint Tables predicted, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.2 miles. Approximately 45 people, as determined by Landview Census data, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint.  There are no other public or environmental receptors within the radius to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.0  Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\nBar-S Foods Elk City, OK facility standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel.  The facility has implemented an OSHA PSM program which is equivalent to the EPA RMP Program 3 Prevention Program.  Other accidental release prevention practi"

A facility emergency response plan and evacuation plan has been prepared and disseminated to facility personnel.  Selected personnel receive annual HAZWOPER training.\n\n7.0  Planned changes to improve safety ('68.155(g)).\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety consist of continuing annual operator and HAZWOPER training, addressing the PSM audit and Emergency Response Plan audit findings, and fully implementing all PSM Program elements."
