      "SummaryText": "Hermiston Generating Plant\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Hermiston Generating Plant is owned by Hermiston Generating Company L.P. Our overall approach to chemical safety and security involves safe equipment design, well-trained employees & qualified contractors, and regular audits and assessments.\n\nThe Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) operates an electric and steam generating facility.  Natural Gas is used to fire two combustion turbines and the exhaust gas from the turbines is used to produce steam through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). The steam from the HRSG is used to turn two steam turbines. Generators are attached to both the combustion and steam turbines which generate electricity.  \n\nHGP stores an aqueous ammonia solution, which is safer to handle than anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia solution is used in the air pollution control system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  \n\nThe Hermiston Generating Plant complies with the federal Risk Management Program (RMP). The general accidental release prevention program is incorporated into overall safe plant operation.  The plant is continuously staffed, has perimeter fencing and controlled access/gate security.  The control room operators have access to real-time process monitoring data for the entire plant, and can take emergency action remotely (e.g. through remote shut-off valves).  Trained operators perform regular visual inspections of equipment and have been properly trained to respond to an ammonia release.  \n\nHGP has taken several chemical-specific prevention steps to avert any accidental releases of ammonia. A primary concern for accidental release is during the offload of aqueous ammonia. HGP accepts approximately one 60,000lb delivery of ammonia per week. In order to minimize the threat of a release during offload, the Lead Operator and Maintenance Technician (Lead O&M Tech) conducts pre-job briefings prior to each offload of aqueous ammonia where the offload procedure is r"

      "SummaryText": "eviewed with the outside operator and driver prior to the offload.  During the offload, the outside operator and truck driver are stationed at the offload area, with appropriate Personal Protection and the Lead O&M Tech operators remotely monitor the status of the ammonia system. Any release of ammonia would be immediate grounds to cease the offload. An emergency shower is located next to the ammonia tank in the event of an incident. In addition, to the threat of release during offload, normal operations pose a threat. In order to deal with this, the HGP ammonia system is equipment with several alarms dealing with ammonia including loss of dilution air and excess ammonia flow alarms. In the event that an alarm is received in the control room trained operators will take immediate action to correct the problem.  \n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system undergoes preventative maintenance and inspection including daily rounds in the area of the storage tank and ammonia skid, monthly tank and offload area inspection, and annual Ultra Sonic Testing of the Ammonia piping. The ammonia storage is located inside a secondary containment structure and in the event of a catastrophic release, this structure would prevent the spread of aqueous ammonia and slow the evaporation rate. The ammonia is brought to the plant by truck and during offload the truck is parked inside an offload containment berm. \n\nThe aqueous ammonia system has had no spills and no accidents since HGP began operation in 1996.  \n\nHGP has an Emergency Response Plan that has been sent to the Hermiston Fire Department which is also the East Oregon Hazardous Material Team. Plant workers undergo annual hazardous waste operations and  emergency response training. A Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) has recently been established for Umatilla County. HGP is a member of the LEPC which will enhance HGP's ability to respond, not to just aqueous ammonia, but other chemical releases.\n\n"
