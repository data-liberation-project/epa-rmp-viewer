RPF implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate possible hazards.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, RPF implements policies and procedures to protect employees and prevent injury to the public and the environment.

      "SummaryText": "   STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers, LLC Fernandina Plant, located in Fernandina Beach, Florida, is an ammonia-base dissolving sulfite pulp mill, which produces approximately 150,000 tons of highly purified specialty pulp annually.  To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, RPF uses four chemicals subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RPF Fernandina Plant is classified as NAICS Code 32211 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n\n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\n2. Chlorine\n\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\n\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process. \n\nThe maximum ammonia inventory onsite decreased due to switching from railcars to bulk trucks.  The maximum chlorine inventory onsite decreased due to the reduction from 4 to 2 chlorine railcars.  The maximum sulfur dioxide inventory onsite increased changing from approximately 4 to 6 sulfur dioxide railcars.  The maximum chlorine dioxide inventory onsite did not change and includes the two chlorine dioxide storage tanks with concentrations above the 1.0% minimum level specified in the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nReporting requirement removed. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\n\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant is subject to both EPA and OSHA process safety management regulations.

The following 12 sections provide a brief description of the plant's management systems to address the program 3 accident prevention provisions of the EPA's RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.4.1   Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant has compiled written Process Safety Information (PSI) before conducting any process hazard analysis as required by the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The PSM standard requirements for PSI are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.65.  This compilation of written process safety information enables RPF and the employees involved in operating the processes to identify and understand the possible hazards posed by those processes involving toxic substances.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the toxic substances used in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\n\n\n\nPSI has been collected and updated for RPF's four RMP process systems: ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous). Safety Data Sheets (SDS), block flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P & IDs), and equipment information are stored in the PSM Information books, drawings, and equipment files.\n\n\n\n1.4.2    Process Hazard Review\n\n\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant has performed an initial Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) on all four covered processes as well as periodic analyses as required by the PSM/RMP regulations.  The PSM standard requirements for PHAs are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.67.  Initial PHAs were completed by May 1997 for RayAM's four PSM/RMP process systems:  ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Revalidations are required at least every five years and the current frequency of the process hazard reviews for all processes meets t"

PHA's identify, evaluate and control hazards involved in the process.  RPF also has a system in place to address findings and recommendations that result from these studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant has developed, implemented, and maintains clearly written detailed procedures for safely operating and maintaining a process during all operating modes.  In addition to operating procedures, safe work practices have been developed and implemented for the control of hazards and include hot work, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, lockout/tagout, and control over the entrance into a stationary source.  These safe work procedures are in place and are reviewed and revised as needed, but at least on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4    Training\n\n\n\nEach employee at Rayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant involved in operating a covered process has been trained to operate it safely and understands the training.  They also have been trained in the safety and health hazards of each process as required by 40 CFR 68.71 and evaluated for understanding of the training by a written test and/or on the job observations.\n\n\n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or more often if necessary.

This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes to be made to a PSM/RMP covered process.  The procedures require review prior to the change with a special emphasis on safety and training of employees and contractors.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and procedures are updated when a change is made. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.7    Pre-Startup Review\n\n\n\nPrior to starting up any new covered process or modified covered process, Rayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant performs a pre-startup safety review when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any highly hazardous chemical into a new or modified process.  This review is done before startup to verify that safety issues have been addressed. This final pre-startup review aids in ensuring that changes in the system are properly installed and tested before startup.  \n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.8    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nAt least every three years, Rayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant evaluates the effectiveness of the PSM/RMP system.

There are multiple systems in place to achieve this goal. The plant focuses on proactive safety actions, including a safety observation and near miss reporting program, See Something, Say Something. The observation program is based on influencing behavior by conducting observations and providing feedback to both employees and contractors as they perform their duties. The near miss reporting program is focused on addressing employee concerns and issues before an incident occurs.\n\n\n\nOther efforts to improve safety include the development and use of JSAs and SOPs. These programs focus on systematically analyzing jobs to address the hazards and risks. Employees participate in these programs by providing input on each analysis. The resulting JSAs and SOPs are used in training employees how to safely do their jobs. \n\n\n\nIncident investigations are also performed to improve safety. These investigations are conducted when an incident occurs, using TapRoot and 5 Why methodologies. Corrective actions are tracked to closure.
