This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any highly hazardous chemical into a new or modified process.

To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, RPF uses four chemicals subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RPF Fernandina Plant is classified as NAICS Code 32211 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \r\n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\r\n2. Chlorine\r\n3. Chlorine dioxide\r\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\r\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process. \r\nThe maximum ammonia inventory onsite decreased due to switching from railcars to bulk trucks.  The maximum chlorine inventory onsite decreased due to the reduction from 4 to 2 chlorine railcars.  The maximum sulfur dioxide inventory onsite increased changing from approximately 4 to 6 sulfur dioxide railcars.  The maximum chlorine dioxide inventory onsite did not change and includes the two chlorine dioxide storage tanks with concentrations above the 1.0% minimum level specified in the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nReporting requirement removed. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\r\n\r\nRayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant is subject to both EPA and OSHA process safety management regulations.

There are multiple systems in place to achieve this goal. The plant focuses on proactive safety actions, including a safety observation and near miss reporting program, See Something, Say Something. The observation program is based on influencing behavior by conducting observations and providing feedback to both employees and contractors as they perform their duties. The near miss reporting program is focused on addressing employee concerns and issues before an incident occurs.\r\n\r\nOther efforts to improve safety include the development and use of JSAs and SOPs. These programs focus on systematically analyzing jobs to address the hazards and risks. Employees participate in these programs by providing input on each analysis. The resulting JSAs and SOPs are used in training employees how to safely do their jobs. \r\n\r\nIncident investigations are also performed to improve safety. These investigations are conducted when an incident occurs, using TapRoot and 5 Why methodologies. Corrective actions are tracked to closure.
