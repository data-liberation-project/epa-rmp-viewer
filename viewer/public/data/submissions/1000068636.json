The HAZOP and What-If Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results.  The PHA team is comprised of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise brought together to thoroughly review the process hazards through collective brainstorming.\r\n\r\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion, and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Through the management of change process, these procedures are kept current and accurately maintained.  \r\n\r\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use, as necessary, to perform their job tasks safely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees invo"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition to initial training, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  \r\n\r\nAll of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  A modern, up-to-date, fully programmable computer-driven simulator, with display panels identical to those used in the control room, is also available in the larger units for employees to practice unit operations.  The simulators are fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics, and can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they encounter during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery conducts a process startup safety review for any new facility or facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A safety review involves field verification of the construction and provides quality assurance by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nThe refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training inspections and tests.

The BP Cherry Point Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when making repairs. The mechanical integrity program was developed and documented by the Engineering Authority and is updated by the Engineering Authority, as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these practices include: (1) electronic control of unit entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a permit and procedure to control \"hot work\" activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage process changes.

The goal of the program is to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency response duties. \r\n\r\nThe ERP includes a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia), accidental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as the Incident Command System (ICS), to respond to and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (i.e., chain-of-command) structure that places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.
