Resources invested in accident prevention-such as the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes-demonstrate this commitment.\n\n\n\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.",

Resources invested in accident prevention-such as the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes-demonstrate this commitment.\n\n\n\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Unit consists of two processes.  The purpose of the #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit is to convert the low-octane gasoline feed fractions from the Naphtha HDS and Hydrocracker units into a stabilized high-octane blending stock.  This is accomplished through the use of catalyst under high temperatures and a hydrogen atmosphere.  The Naphtha HDS Unit is designed to treat the feedstock for the #1 Reformer.  Treatment is necessary to prevent contamination and plugging of the Reformer catalyst.",

Resources invested in accident prevention-such as the training of personnel and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes-demonstrate this commitment.\n\n\n\nThe #2 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization (#2 DHDS) is designed to process 18,000 barrels per day of diesel feed and to operate at 850 pounds per square inch gauge.  The design basis provides for a \"future case\" where the unit can process cracked feedstocks under more severe conditions, although numerous modifications still need to be made to accomplish this.  As currently designed, the unit processes straight-run diesel feeds from the crude unit.  The #2 DHDS process combines hydrogen with straight-run diesel feeds and processes them in a high-pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst.  The reaction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing.  The amine hydrogen sulfide mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur.  The unit consumes 6 to 7 million standard cubic feet per day of 220 pounds per square inch gauge hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 parts per million (ppm) to less than 15 ppm.",

              "Description": "\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe #3 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization Unit #27 is designed to process 12,300 BPD of light coker gas oil and 14,600 BPD of diesel feed and to operate at 750 psig. As currently designed, the unit will process light coker gas oil feed from the Coker Unit, straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit and vacuum diesel fractionator, and tallow. Renewable diesel is being produced by the co-processing of the tallow with existing feeds into #3 Diesel Hydrotreater. The DHDS process combines hydrogen with the straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing. The amine hydrogen sulfide mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur. The unit consumes 12.8 million standard cubic feet per day of 1,226 pounds per square inch gauge hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 parts per million (ppm) to less than 15 ppm.

As currently designed, the unit will process light coker gas oil feed from the Coker Unit, straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit and vacuum diesel fractionator, and tallow. Renewable diesel is being produced by the co-processing of the tallow with existing feeds into #3 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization Unit. The #3 DHDS process combines hydrogen with the straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing. The amine hydrogen sulfide mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur. The unit consumes 12.8 million standard cubic feet per day of 1,226 pounds per square inch gauge hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 parts per million (ppm) to less than 15 ppm.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining and updating process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The HAZOP and What-If Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results.  The PHA team is comprised of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise brought together to thoroughly review the process hazards through collective brainstorming.\n\n\n\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion, and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Through the management of change process, these procedures are kept current and accurately maintained.  \n\n\n\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use, as necessary, to perform their job tasks safely.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees invo"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition to initial training, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  \n\n\n\nAll of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  A modern, up-to-date, fully programmable computer-driven simulator, with display panels identical to those used in the control room, is also available in the larger units for employees to practice unit operations.  The simulators are fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics, and can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they encounter during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
