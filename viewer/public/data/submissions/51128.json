      "SummaryText": "Country Delite Farms plant processes fluid milk.   The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid milk within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high pressure vessel, evaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:   Country Delite Farms is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and EPA's Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, there programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst care release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for the actual emergency response planning.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The worst case release scenario for the refriger"

      "SummaryText": "ation process is assumed to be a case where the total of ammonia in the high pressure vessel is released.  The release scenario was conducted assuming that the vessel was filled to capacity.  The receiver, however, is normally filled 2/3 full.  There is no passive mitigation systems considered in the analysis since the vessel is located outdoors.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Bases on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario selected is one in which an ammonia line is ruptured.  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1.   Must be more likely to occur that the worst case scenario, and\n2.   Must reach an endpoint off suite, unless no such criteria exist.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  Base on EPA's guidance the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  As a part of the PSM program, Country Delite Farms plant has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  There programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMecha"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 which will notify the local fire depatment and hazmat team has included the Country Delite Farms plant in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  Country Delite Farms plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  In addition, Country Delite Farms will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
