That portion of the Jayhawk Plant Site containing Jayhawk property, buildings and equipment will be referred to hereinafter as the \"Facility\". \n\n    The Facility is located on approximately 850 acres of a 2,200-acre industrial     complex. Jayhawk's Unit 1 encompasses approximately 29 acres and Unit 2     encompasses approximately 25 acres. The Facility is located approximately 3.5          miles north of the junction of Kansas Route 66 and U.S. Highway 400 at     Riverton, Kansas. \n\n\n\n    The regulated substances handled at Jayhawk include:\n\n1.
