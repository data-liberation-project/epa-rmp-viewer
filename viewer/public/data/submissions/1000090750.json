A major expansion of the business in November of 2020, required more ammonia to be added to the system to operate additional equipment; driving the total quantity of ammonia over the TQ of 10,000 pounds. Prior to becoming a PSM facility, Crown Bakeries had one reportable ammonia leak incident in 2017. At the time of this ammonia occurrence, Crown Bakeries followed proper leak reporting procedures and carried out an Incident Investigation. The Incident Investigation findings indicated that a failure of a seal on the oil reservoir of an ammonia pump caused the release. 1,623 pounds of ammonia was released from the ammonia pump into the compressor room. Ventilation fans were used to dissipate the ammonia until ammonia concentrations were back to normal, safe levels. Recommendations derived from the Incident Investigation, stated that the open seal ammonia pumps should be replaced with enclosed seal ammonia pumps that are much less likely to experience leaks. Crown Bakeries followed through on that recommendation and replaced the open seal pumps with enclosed seal pumps. Two open seal pumps still exist, but they are not in operation. These remaining open seal pumps are scheduled to be replaced in 2021. The PHA took this prior incident under consideration and specific What-If questions addressed safety concerns with these types of ammonia pumps and ammonia pumps in general.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nCrown Bakery's employees have not been trained to be Emergency Responders and will not respond to emergency ammonia releases; however, the system can be shut down by activating one of the EMERGENCY STOP (E-STOP) switches located outside the Engine Room doors. An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local, county, state, and national responders. Procedures f"

The refrigeration process at this facility is comprised of one closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pumps or pressure differential to the evaporators, roof-top air-handling unit, vessels, and heat exchangers. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the process equipment returns to the recirculators. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 120 to 190 psig. The maximum allowable high side working pressure is 300 psig.\r\nAs part of the PSM program, Crown Bakeries has completed a Process Hazard Analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on ammonia and PSM awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct Management of Change procedures and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and developed a Mechanical Integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Crown Bakeries has implemented an ongoing Preventive Maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Crown Bakeries to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Nashville, TN facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Crown Bakeries includes the following steps:\r\nManagement System: Designates individuals responsible fo"
