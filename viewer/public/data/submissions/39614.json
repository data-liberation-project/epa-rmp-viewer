      "SummaryText": "Packerland Whey Products, Inc. produces a high protein, high energy feed intended for beef and dairy cattle.  The feed is called Fermented, Ammoniated, Condensed Whey as described by FDA Regulation CFR 573.450.  We ferment fresh cheese whey using typical cheese cultures.  The culture converts lactose or milk sugar to lactic acid.  We neutralize the lactic acid with aqua ammonia.  During neutralization, the lactic acid is converted to ammonium lactate.  When all the sugar has been fermented to ammonium lactate, we evaporate the fermented whey to 61.5% solids.  The final product we call Lacto-Whey conatins 44% crude protein and as much or more energy than soybean meal.  Lacto-Whey competes with soybean meal as a protein source.  Lacto-Whey has been fed to beef and dairy cattle since 1979 with excellent results.\n\nThe fermentation process includes converting anhydrous ammonia to aqua ammonia through an ammonia converter.  Anhydrus ammonia is fed from the 12,000 gal holding tank to the converter where it is mixed with water and cooled.  The 24% aqua ammonia is stored in a separate tank to be used to neutralize lactic acid formed during fermentation.  Our anhydrous ammonia tank is of conventional design, state inspected and state approved.  This tank includes all the safety features typically used for anhydrous ammonia storage.  It is routinely inspected by the state and our insurance inspectors.  The tank has internal, excess flow shut off valves to stop the flow of ammonia in the event of a hose failure or accident which could release ammonia from an attached line.  The tank is also equipped with two pressure release valves to prevent over pressurization.  Trucks filling our tank hook up a second line to equalize pressure in the head space of our tank and the truck tank.  This prevents over pressurization.  We have experienced no failures of the tank or lines since start-up in 1979.\n\nOur employees are trained on the job to be careful with ammonia and never move toward a"

They are trained to place wheel chocks under the truck tires, verify connection of the vapor line between the truck tank and our tank before filling.  The tank fill and empty ports are locked and our employee unlocks the ports for the driver.  Fixed piping carries anhydrous ammonia from its storage tank through the converter and into the aqua-ammonia tank.  We have a safety shower located close to the ammonia converter and an eye wash station near by.  We have a scrubber on the the aqua ammonia tank to remove any ammonia vapor before it enters the atomosphere.  In addition, we have ammonia certified respirators and self contained air tank and mask, protective rubber suit, gloves and other equipment ready to be used in the event of an accident.  Emergency hand valves are strategically placed allowing us to shut-off the flow of ammonia in the event of an accident or piping failure.\n\nOn September 30, 1991, a full scale exercise was conducted.  This involved the Kewaunee County Division of Emergency Government (LEPC) and the Luxemburg Community Fire Department.  The scenario chosen was that a forklift accidentally knocked off a valve at the bottom of the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The internal excess flow valve failed to close completely and ammonia was leaking out.  From this exercise, recommendations were made to handle such an event.  For example, the fire department felt they could fog the area surrounding the failed safety valve with water while a person in full frotective suit and air supply tapped the valve area to shut it completely.  The report of the exercise is part of our Off-Site Plan and copies are available from the Kewaunee county LEPC or Luxemburg Community Fire Department."
