THE LIQUID AMMONIA RUNNING THEOUGH THE SYSTEM ENTERS SIDE 1 AND SIDE 2 EVAPORATORS SIMULTANEOUSLY.  BOTH SIDES  RUN SEPERATELY AND CAN BE SHUT DOWN INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT AFFECTING THE OTHER.  A SOLENOID VALVE CONTROLS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  WHEN THE LEVEL OF AMMONIA REACHES THE SET POINT, THE FLOAT VALVE TRIGGERS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW.  THE LIQUID AMMONIA IN THE EVAPORATOR FILLS COILED PIPES FROM THE BOTTOM UP.  FANS BLOW AIR OVER THE COILS CAUSING THE AMMONIA INSIDE TO BOIL.  THIS COOLS THE OUTSIDE AIR,  RESULTING IN REFRIGERATION.  THE AMMONIA IN THE EVAPORATORS  GOES BACK AS AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE RECEIVING TANK AND IS RELEASED THROUGH A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR CONTROLS THE PRESSURE IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR RELEASES AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE SUCTION LINE WHEN THE PRESSURE GETS TO ITS PRESET LEVEL.   THE VAPOR RETURNS TO THE COMPRESSOR  ROOM.  IF THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR ISN'T OPERATING CORRECTLY AND PRESSURE  IS BUILDING UP IN THE RECEIVERS AND EVAPORATORS, THE SAFETY-RELEASE VALVES WILL RELEASE THE EXCESS AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE AIR OUTSIDE THE PLANT.   OPERATIONAL HISTORY OF THIS UNIT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD.  DEVIATION CAN RESULT FROM HIGH TEMPERATURE.  TO STOP DEVIATION TEMPERATURES ARE MONITORED 3 TIMES DAILY DURING EACH SHIFT.  OIL AND WATER ARE DRAINED MONTHLY.  SOLENOID VALVES ARE REPLACED YEARLY.  STRAINERS ARE CLEANED YEARLY.  EQUIPMENT IS INSPECTED EVERY 6 MONTHS.  LUBE BEARING, BELTS, FANS ARE INSPECTED EVERY 6 MONTHS.",

THE LIQUID AMMONIA RUNNING TO COLD STORAGE #1 SYSTEM ENTERS SIDE 1 AND SIDE 2 EVAPORATORS SIMULTANEOUSLY.  BOTH SIDES RUN INDEPENDENTLY AND CAN BE SHUT DOWN INDIVIDUALLY WITHOUT AFFECTING THE OTHER.  A SOLENOID VALVE CONTROLS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  COLD STORAGE #2 HAS ONLY ONE EVAPORATOR.  A SOLENOID VALVE CONTROLS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  THE AMMONIA SYSTEM IN COLD STORAGE #3 USES A THERMO-EXPANSION VALVE FOR EACH OF THE SIX EVAPORATORS.  ONE SOLENOID VALVE ALLOWS LIQUID AMMONIA INTO THE MAIN LINE FOR COLD STORAGE #3.  COLD STORAGE #4 HAS SIX EVAPORATORS EACH  WITH  ITS OWN RECEIVING TANK.  EACH OF THE SIX SYSTEMS ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN SOLENOID AND FLOAT VALVES,  ALTHOUGH A PAIR OF EVAPORATORS SHARE BACK PRESSURE VALVES.  COLD STORAGE #1, #2, #4 EVAPORATORS WORK ON A FLOOD SYSTEM THE EVAPORATORS AND THE COLUMNS ARE FILLED UP TO THE SAME LEVEL WITH LIQUID AMMONIA.  WHEN THE FLOAT VALVE SENSES THE AMMONIA LEVEL DROPPING, IT ELECTRICALLY SIGNALS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO OPEN, ALLOWING MORE AMMONIA INTO THE TANK.  WHEN THE LEVEL OF AMMONIA REACHES THE SET POINT, THE FLOAT VALVE TRIGGERS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW.   COLD STORAGE #3 THERMO-EXPANSION VALVE METERS AMMONIA INTO THE COILS AT A RATE WHICH ALLLOWS AMMONIA TO VAPORIZE IN THE COIL.  IN COLD STORAGE UNITS #1, #2, AND #4 THE AMMONIA BOILS IN THE EVAPORATORS AND THE VAPOR GOES BACK INTO THE RECEIVER TANK AND IS RELEASED THROUGH A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR OUTSIDE THE PLANT.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR CONTROLS THE PRESSURE  IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURES  IN THE WAREHOUSES.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATORS RELEASE AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE SUCTION LINES WHEN THE PRESSURE GETS TO ITS PRESET LEVEL.  THE VAPOR RETURNS TO THE COMPRESSOR ROOM.  IF THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR ISN'T OPERATING CORRECTLY AND PRESSURE IS BUILDING UP IN THE RECEIVERS AND EVAPORATORS, THE SAFETY-RELEASE VALVES WILL RELEASE THE EXCESS AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE AIR OUTSIDE THE PLANT.

              "Description": "GRADE A SWEET WATER CHILLER--LIQUID AMMONIA FLOWS FROM THE KING TANK AND IS COOLED THROUGH THE HIGH SIDE TANK.  THE AMMONIA THEN FLOWS THROUGH A REGULAR OR METERED VALVE ON THE MANIFOLD THROUGH LABELED PIPING.  THE CHILLER USES A HEAT EXCHANGER WITH ITS OWN RECEIVING TANK.  THE CHILLER WORKS ON A FLOOD SYSTEM.  THIS MEANS THE RECEIVER TANK, THE HEAT EXCHANGER AND COLUMN ARE ALL FILLED UP TO THE SAME LEVEL WITH LIQUID AMMONIA.   WHEN THE FLOAT SWITCH SENSES THE AMMONIA LEVEL DROPPING,  IT ELECTRICALLY SIGNALS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO OPEN.  THIS ALLOWS MORE AMMONIA TO ENTER THE HEAT EXCHANGER.  WHEN THE LEVEL OF AMMONIA REACHES THE SET POINT, THE FLOAT VALVE TRIGGERS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW.  THE CHILLER SYSTEM HAS TWO SOLENOID VALVES IN CASE ONE QUITS WORKING.  THE AMMONIA BOILS IN THE HEAT EXCHANGER AND AMMONIA VAPOR GOES BACK INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  IT IS RELEASED THROUGH A  BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE REGULATOR CONTROLS THE PRESSURE IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER.  THE BACK  PRESSURE REGULATOR RELEASES AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE SUCTION LINE WHEN THE PRESSURE GETS TO 30 PSI.  THE VAPOR THEN RETURNS TO THE HIGH SIDE TANK.  OPERATIONAL  HISTORY HAS BEEN VERY GOOD ON THIS UNIT.  AN OCCASIONAL FLOOD BACK OF AMMONIA COULD RESULT FROM A STUCK, FLOAT SWITCH, SOLENOID VALVE OR BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  DEVIATION COULD RESULT FROM HIGH WATER TEMPERATURE.  TO CORRECT DEVIATION TEMPERATURES ARE MONITORED DAILY .  WATER AND OIL ARE DRAINED MONTHLY.  THE SOLENOID VALVES ARE REPLACED YEARLY.  STRAINERS ARE CLEANED YEARLY.  EQUIPMENT IS INSPECTED MONTH.  WATER QUALITY IS MONITORED ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND PRODUCT TEMPERATURE IS MONITORED DAILY.",

              "Description": "COMPRESSOR ROOM AND TANK ROOM-- THE COMPRESSOR ROOM HAS THREE HIGH SIDE AND THREE LOW SIDE COMPRESSORS.  BOTH SIDES FUNCTION DFFERENTLY IN THE AMMONIA SYSTEM.  THE HIGH SIDE COMPRESSOR REMOVES SATURATED GAS FROM THE HIGH SIDE TANK AND HEATS IT AND BUILDS IT TO 130 PSI BEFORE SENDING IT OUT TO THE CONDENSING TOWERS TO BECOME LIQUID AGAIN.  THE LOW SIDE COMPRESSORS APPLY VACUUM TO REFRIGERATION UNITS USED FOR FREEZING DRAWING VAPOR AMMONIA THROUGH THE LOW SIDE TANK.  THE LOW SIDE COMPRESSOR THEN REPRESSURIZES THE VAPOR AMMONIA TO ABOUT 20 PSI AND DUMPS IT INTO THE HIGH SIDE TANK AS A SATURATED GAS.  HERE, THE HIGH SIDE TANK AGAIN TAKES OVER.  THE COMPRESSORS HAVE PRESET RUNNING TEMPERATURES AND PARAMETERS.  CURRENT RUNNING LEVELS CAN BE READ FROM THE GAUGES OR DITIGAL READOUTS.  THE COMPRESSORS TEMPERATURE IS MAINTAINED BY A OIL HEATING SYSTEM.  AMMONIA KEEPS THE OIL BELOW 155 DEGREES BY COOLING THE TANK ON A FLOOD SYSTEM WITH A RECEIVER TANK MOUNTED NEAR THE CEILING.  THE AMMONIA VAPOR GOES BACK INTO THE HIGH SIDE TANK AS SATURATED GAS.  THE LOW SIDE COMPRESSOR IS DIRECTLY AMMONIA COOLED.  AMMONIA FLOWS TO THESE COMPRESSORS FROM THE MANIFOLD AND IS RETRURNED TO THE HIGH SIDE TANK.  RELIEF VALVES ARE LOCATED ON EACH COMPRESSOR.  EACH OF THESE VALVES IS ON A TREE SO THAT ONE CAN BE WORKED ON WHILE THE OTHER IS STILL RUNNING.  THE TANK ROOM CONTAINS THREE TANKS AND THREE MANIFOLDS.  THE TANKS INCLUDE A HIGH SIDE AND A LOW SIDE TANK AS WELL AS A SMALLER TRANSFER TANK.  ONE MANIFOLD CHANNELS LIQUID AMMONIA OUT TO EACH SYSTEM THROUGH EITHER A METERED OR REGULAR VALVE, WHILE THE OTHER TWO ARE SUCTION MANIFOLDS FOR GAS RETURNING FROM THE HIGH SIDE AND LOW SIDE UNITS.  THE HIGH SIDE TANK HAS  COILS INSIDE WHERE LIQUID AMMONIA FLOWS FROM THE CONDENSERS TO THE MANIFOLD.  GASEOUS AMMONIA FLOWS INTO THE TANK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE COILS FROM REFRIGERATION UNITS AND FROM THE LOW SIDE COMPRESSORS.  THIS COOLS THE LIQUID INSIDE BEFORE GOING INTO THE REFRIGERATION UNITS.  THE LOW SIDE TANK COLLECTS GASEOUS AMMONIA FROM THE FREEZER UNITS AND TRANSFERS  IT TO THE LOW SIDE THE TRANSFER TANK IS USED TO MITIGATE FLOODBACK.  OPERATIONAL HISTORY OF THIS UNIT HAS GENERALLY BEEN GOOD.  DEVIATION COULD RESULT FROM IMPROPER PRESSURES.  COMPRESSORS WILL SHUT DOWN IF THE OIL TEMPERATURE IS TO HOT.  TO CORRECT THIS DEVIATION RUN DIFFERENT COMPRESSORS  IF THE PRESSURE NEEDS ADJUSTING.  TEMPERATURES  ARE CHECKED DAILY AND EQUIPMENT SERVICED MONTHLY AND YEARLY.",

THE AMMONIA THEN FLOWS THROUGH A REGULAR OR METERED VALVE ON THE MANIFOLD TO THE STARTER ROOM THROUGH LABELED PIPING.   THE STARTER ROOM USES A SHELL AND TUBE HEAT EXCHANGER.  THE CHILLER WORKS ON A FLOOD SYSTEM.  THE RECEIVER TANK, HEAT EXCHANGER AND COLUMN  ARE ALL FILLED UP TO THE SAME LEVEL WITH LIQUID AMMONIA.  WHEN THE FLOAT SWITCH SENSES A DROP IN THE AMMONIA LEVEL, IT ELECTRICALLY SIGNALS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO OPEN.  THIS ALLOWS MORE AMMONIA INTO THE HEAT EXCHANGER.  WHEN THE AMMONIA REACHES THE SET POINT, THE FLOAT SWITCH TRIGGERS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW.  AMMONIA SHOULD NOT BE UP TO THE SECOND FLOAT SWITCH.  IF THE FLOAT SWITCH IS CLOSED THERE MAY BE A FLOODBACK.  THE AMMONIA BOILS IN THE HEAT EXCHANGER AND AMMONIA VAPOR GOES BACK INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  IT IS RELEASED THROUGH A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.   THE VAPOR THEN RETURNS TO THE HIGH SIDE TANK.  SOME VAPOR GOES TO THE STARTER INJECTION SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER.  THE BOTTOM SYSTEM IS TURNED IN FOR AUTOMATIC OPERATION AND TURNED OUT TO MANUALLY OPEN THE VALVE.  THE SMALL REGULATOR MOUNTED OFF-CENTER IS USED TO ADJUST THE PRESSURE WHEN THE SOLENOID COIL ON THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR IS DE-ENGERIZED.

IT IS RELEASED THROUGH A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR CONTROLS THE PRESSURE IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE IN THE CHILLER.

              "Description": "ICE CREAM MACHINE--LIQUID AMMONIA FLOWS FROM THE KING TANK AND IS COOLED THROUGH THE HIGH SIDE TANK.   IT THENS FLOWS FROM A REGULAR  OR METERED VALVE ON THE MANIFOLD THROUGH  LABELED PIPING.  THERE ARE THREE INDEPENDENT ICE CREAM MACHINES.  EACH MACHINE HAS THREE CHILLING UNITS THAT CAN EACH BE OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, ALONG WITH A HOT GAS SYSTEM.   A SOLENOID VALVE CONTROLS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA INTO THE CHILLER,.  EACH MACHINE HAS ITS OWN SOLENOID VALVE TO CONTROL THE FLOW, IT OWN ELECTRICALLY CONTROLLER  BACK  PRESSURE REGULAOR,  ITS OWN HOT GAS SOLENOID AND ITS OWN PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE.  THE CHILLER WORKS ON A FLOOD SYSTEM WITH THE LEVEL OF EACH BARREL CONTROLLED BY A FLOAT VALVE.  THE CHILLERS  ARE CONSTANTELY FLOODED WITH AMMONIA AND THE TEMPERATURE IS CONTROL BY A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE LIQUID AMMONIA IN THE EVAPORATOR FILLS A TANK OUTSIDE OF THE PRODUCT BARREL FROM THE BOTTOM UP.  PRODUCT MOVES INSIDE THE BARREL CAUSING  THE AMMONIA OUTSIDE TO BOIL.  AFTER BOILING, AMMONIA VAPOR GOES BACK INTO THE RECEIVING TANK IT IS RELEASED THROUGH A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR CONTROLS THE PRESSURE IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE IN THE FREEZER.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR RELEASES AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE SUCTION LINE WHEN THE PRESSURE GETS TO ITS PRESET LEVEL.  THE VAPOR THEN RETURNS TO THE COMPRESSOR ROOM.  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE HAS THREE SEPARATE CHILLER AND A SEPERATE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR TO CONTROL EACH OF THEM.  OPERATIONAL HISTORY FOR THIS UNIT HAS BEEN GOOD, ALTHOUGH THE VACUUM LEAKS ON OCCASION.  DEVIATION COULD RESULT FROM HIGH TEMPERATURE.  IF DEVIATION WE NEED TO CHECK TO SEE IF AMMONIA IS GETTING TO THE SYSTEM, IF NOT, CHECK THE DEFROST VALVE, FLOAT SWITCH, REGULAR OR METERED VALVES ON THE MANIFOLD AND SOLENOID VALVE.  IF EVAPORATOR IS FROZEN RUN A DEFROST AND IF THERE IS NOT PRESSURE TO THE EVAPORATOR CHECK THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.",

THE FIRST TWO FILTERS REMOVE ANY OIL OR WATER THAG  MAY BE IN THE AMMONIA.  THE FIRST FILTER USES A GREEN FILTER INSERT, THE SECOND, A RED ONE.  BOTH FILTERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH DRAIN VALVES.  THE THIRD FILTER IS A PRECAUTIONARY BACTERIAL FILTER, THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE NO BACTERIA IN THE AMMONIA VAPOR.  AFTER BEING FILTERED, THE AMMONIA ENTERS A BOX WHERE THE PRESSURE IS GAUGED.  AMMONIA CAN BE RELEASED BACK INTO THE STARTER CHILLER  ROOM  BUT USUALLY GOES THROUGH VALVES INTO A SMALL MANIFOLD.  THIS MANIFOLD SENDS VAPOR AMMONIA TO ONE OF FOUR STARTER TANKS OR BACK TO THE STARTER CHILLER ROOM.  THE VAPOR IS CONTROLLED BY FOUR SOLENOID VALVES.  ALL EIGHT SOLENOID VALVES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE TI COMPUTER.  THE OTHER FOUR SOLENOID VALVES  RELEASE AMMONIA VAPOR INTO WATER SOAKED COTTON  IF SUPPLY VALVE LEAKS OR TO MUCH AMMONIA.  THS VAPOR IS NOT RELEASED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING BUT INTO A PIPE STUFFED WITH COTTON THAT ABSORBS EXCESS AMMONIA GAS.  THESE COTTON  PIECES  ARE REPLACES WHEN SATURATED.  OPERATIONAL HISTORY HAS BEEN NO RELEASES SINCE INSTALLATION.  DEVIATION COULD RESULT IN A LEAK OF AMMMONIA BECAUSE OF A SOLENOID VALVE.

              "Description": "GRADE A MILK COOLER--LIQUID AMMONIA FLOWS FROM THE KING TANK IS COOLED THROUGH THE HIGH SIDE TANK , AND THEN FLOWS THROUGH A REGULAR OR METERED VALVE ON THE MANIFOLD TO THE COOLER THROUGH LABELED PIPING.  THE COOLER OPERATES ON A SIMPLE FLOOD SYSTEM.  THE RECEIVER TANK, EVAPORATOR AND COLUMN FILL UP TO THE SAME LEVEL WITH LIQUID AMMONIA.  WHEN THE FLOAT SWITCH SENSES A DROP IN THE AMMONIA LEVEL, IT ELECTRICALLY SIGNALS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO OPEN, ALLOWING MORE AMMONIA INTO THE TANK.  WHEN THE LEVEL OF AMMONIA REACHES THE SET POINT, THE FLOAT SWITCH TRIGGERS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW.  THE AMMONIA BOILS IN THE EVAPORATOR AND GOES BACK INTO THE RECEIVER TANK AS AMMONIA VAPOR.   IT IS RELEASED THROUGH A BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR CONTROLS THE PRESSURE IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM, WHICH IN TURN, CONTROLS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COOLER.  THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR RELEASES AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE SUCTION LINE WHEN THE PRESSURE GETS TO A PRESET LEVEL.  THE VAPOR THEN RETURNS TO THE COMPRESSOR ROOM.  IF THE BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR ISN'T OPERATING CORRECTLY AND PRESSURE IS BUILDING IN THE RECEIVER AND EVAPORATOR, THE SAFETY-RELEASE VALVES WILL RELEASE THE EXCESS AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE AIIR OUTSIDE THE PLANT.  OPERATIONAL HISTORY FOR THIS UNIT HAS BEEN GOOD.  DEVIATION MAY RESULT IF HIGH TEMPERATURE.  TEMPERATURES ARE CHECK THREE TIMES PER DAY.  OIL IS DRAINED MONTHLY.  SOLENOID VALVES ARE INSPECTED ANNUALLY.",

              "Description": "BUTTER FREEZER--LIQUID AMMONIA FLOWS FROM THE KING TANK AND IS COOLED THROUGH THE HIGH SIDE TANK.  THE AMMONIA THEN FLOWS THROUGH A REGULAR OR METERED VALVE ON THE MANIFOLD TO THE BUTTER FREEZER THROUGH LABELED PIPING.  THE FREEZER HAS ONE EVAPORATOR AND A HOT GAS DEFROST SYSTEM.  A SOLENOID VALVE CONTROLS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  THE TANK AND EVAPORATOR WORK ON A FLOOD SYSTEM.  THE TANK, EVAPORATOR AND COLUMN ARE FILLED TO THE SAME LEVEL WITH LIQUID AMMONIA.  WHEN THE FLOAT SWITCH SENSES A DROP IN THE AMMONIA LEVEL, IT ELECRICALLY SIGNALS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO OPEN.  THIS ALLLOWS MORE AMMONIA INTO THE TAHNK.  WHEN THE LEVEL OF AMMONIA REACHES THE SET POINT, THE FLOAT SWITCH TRIGGERS THE SOLENOID VALVE TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW.  THE AMMONIA BOILS IN THE EVAPORATOR AND AMMONIA VAPOR GOES BACK INTO THE RECEIVER TANK.  THE VAPOR THEN RETURNS TO THE COMPRESSOR ROOM.  IF PRESSURE IS BUILDING IN THE RECEIVER AND EVAPORATOR, THE SAFETY-RELEASE VALVES WILL RELEASE THE EXCESS AMMONIA VAPOR INTO THE AIR OUTSIDE OF THE PLANT.  OPERATIONAL HISTORY FOR THIS UNIT HAS BEEN GOOD.  OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE DEFROST PROBLEMS.  DEVIATION WOULD BE A RESULT OF ALTERED TEMPERATURE.  TEMPERATURES  ARE CHECKED THREE TIMES PER DAY.

The Tillamook County Creamery Association recognizes the duty to protect the safety and health of employees, the community, and our customers.  Therefore, the Tillamook County Creamery Association has developed, and implemented, a Risk Management Plan for anhydrous ammonia.  The purpose of this plan is to keep safe operation a Company priority through establishing policy, identifying risks, documenting maintenance, and tracking compliance with established standards. \n\nThis plan is a living collaborative effort developed by employees, maintenance engineers, and management.  Joanne Breuer, Tillamook County Creamery Association's Safety Director, has been appointed plan manager and will consult with employees on a regular basis regarding the conduct and development of Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) and plan modification. \n\nThe Tillamook County Creamery Association produces natural cheddar cheeses that are aged 90 to 720 days.  Proper aging requires precise temperature control and extensive refrigeration.   As is common in the industry, TCCA uses an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in all cheese storage areas.  Approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is contained in the refrigeration system.  It is the intent of the Risk Management Plan to identify and prepare for a worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia.  This plan applies to all ammonia refrigeration units, lines, tanks, and compressors located throughout the facility.\n\nThe worst-case scenario identified in the Risk Management Plan is the catastrophic loss of 20,000 pounds of ammonia within 10 minutes.  Such a catastrophic release will have off-site consequences "

      "SummaryText": "that will require notification, and potential evacuation of nearby residences.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas or liquid with a readily detectable odor at 0.7ppm.  Ammonia gas is a severe irritant to eyes, skin and respiratory tract.  Exposure to concentrations of 2,500 to 6,500 ppm, which could occur in a worst-case scenario, can cause corneal irritation, shortness of breath, bronchospasms, chest pains, and pulmonary edema, which may be fatal.  Contained in the plan are procedures to mitigate the off-site consequences and procedures to implement resident notification.\n\nAn alternate, more likely, scenario identified in the Risk Management Plan is the release of 1 to 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  A release of 1 to 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia still presents a risk to employees and visitors.  However, such a release does not have the off-site consequences identified in the worst-case scenario, and will not require notification or evacuation of nearby residences.  Maintenance policy and training have been developed to facilitate immediate resolution of any ammonia leak, before it can develop into a worst-case scenario.  Within the plan are procedures to evacuate employees while repairing the leak. \n\nThe Risk Management Plan also outlines a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program.  This program identifies each component of the ammonia refrigeration system and evaluates the potential ammonia release risk.  An important item of the PHA program is a \"What-If Analysis\" of each component.  The intent of the \"What-If Analysis\" is to identify ways in which ammonia could be released, and develop a response to minimize the magnitude of the release.  \n\nDevelopment of a Risk Management Plan is a proactive effort by the Tillamook County Creamery Association to protect both the employee, and the community from future releases of ammonia.  While small releases of ammonia do occur, there has not been a release of a reportable amount of ammonia in the past 5 years.  \n\nAnother im"

      "SummaryText": "portant aspect of the Risk Management Plan is the Emergency Response Program.  The Emergency Response Program is a written action plan outlining the response of the Tillamook County Creamery Association HAZMAT team to any release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The Emergency Response Plan was developed in coordination with Tillamook County Fire Department, Oregon State Police, Tillamook County Ambulance, 911 Emergency Center, and the Tillamook County General Hospital.  Key issues outlined in the plan include: escape routes, decontamination procedures, medical duties, post evacuation procedures, and reporting requirements.  All of the agencies involved in the Emergency Response Program train regularly, and participate in periodic ammonia release drills.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan developed by the Tillamook County Creamery Association is a dynamic document.  This plan is updated annually, or whenever any component of the ammonia refrigeration system changes.  TCCA is committed to reducing the likelihood of an ammonia release.  To improve process safety, and protect employees and the public, improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system will be implemented when identified."
