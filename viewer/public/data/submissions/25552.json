If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mazon Fire Department, Grundy County Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 2-12,000 and 1-30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantityof anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 322,000 pounds, this includesthe amount of anhydrous ammonisa that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds which represents the volume of the tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the closing of tank valves, was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of product release.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is 0.2 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Ruls and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
