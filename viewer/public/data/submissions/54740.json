(PPG) and is operated by LeSaint Logistics.  The Lima Distribution Center is a part of the PPG Automotive Refinish business in the Performance Coatings Strategic Business Unit within PPG.  The facility stores automotive refinish paints, primers, and associated products.  These products are distributed to both the internal refinish distribution centers and external distributors throughout North America.  The facility stores products in containers of various sizes, including the regulated substance, aerosol spray cans.  Some of these aerosol containers contain propane and butane, which are used as propellants.  These materials are regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) standard, 40 CFR 68.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe PPG Refinish ? Lima Distribution Center complies with all applicable Ohio and United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations as well as all applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  The facility also follows the Responsible Care? Codes of Management Practice, including the Responsible Care? Community Awareness Code of Management Practice.  The facility?s emergency response plan is defined in the LeSaint Safety and Emergency Manual.  This manual provides instructions on how to handle emergencies that may arise in the facility.  The facility?s employees are also trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling, and fork truck safety.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA RMP requires that worst case release scenarios are analyzed for each process covered under the RMP standard.  The guidelines require that the scenario considers the maximum amount of a material that can be released.  The scenario considers a vapo"

      "SummaryText": "r cloud release due to an explosion of the largest regulated container.   \nThe scenario performed considers offsite consequences of the largest quantity of one aerosol container containing a 50/50 mixture of propane and butane.  The largest container used to store aerosols at the facility is less than one pound, however one pound was considered in the scenario.  The scenario was modeled using the EPA?s RMP*Comp software.  The analysis resulted in a release that traveled 42.24 feet (0.008 miles).  Due to the limitations of the RMP*Submit 2004 software, 0.01 miles were reported (52.8 feet).  Based on the data and the criteria given by the EPA, this scenario does not have an offsite consequence.\nSince the facility does not have any public receptors within the endpoint of the Worst Case Scenario, it is considered Program Level 1 and thus does not require an alternative release scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe PPG Refinish ? Lima Distribution Center has been identified as Program Level 1, thus the worst case release has no off-site consequences.  The RMP standard does not require the submission of Prevention Program information for Program Level 1 facilities, per 40 CFR 68.12(b).\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases at the PPG Refinish ? Lima Distribution Center in the past 5 years that resulted in an on-site or off-site impact.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe PPG Refinish ? Lima Distribution Center coordinates emergency response procedure with the Fort Shawnee Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary.
