Limited response measures are taken by facility personnel, and significant releases involve outside hazmat contractors. Accidental release prevention is accomplished by a program of preventive maintenance and inspections for areas of hazardous materials use and storage, combined with ongoing employee awareness training.\n\nThe stationary souce covered by this RMP is the bulk storage tank room at the facility.  The sole regulated substance handled is Formaldehyde (solutions).\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is a hypothetical explosion of the 2000 gallon Formcel storage tank resulting in an atmospheric release of the entire contents.  The alternative release scenario is a spill resulting from transfer hose failure during filling of the 2000 gallon Formcel storage tank.  Administrative controls and mitigation measures for both scenarios include daily observations, tank level indicators, containment dikes and walls, combination relief vents and flame arrestors, automatic positive shutoff valves, cam-lock hose fittings, and sprinkler systems for fire protection.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program, as previously stated, involves preventive maintenance and inspection of all equipment involved with the stationary source, on at least an annual basis.  Daily observations of the stationary source and connected equipment are also performed.  Offloading of the sole regulated substance into the bulk storage tanks is performed under company observation.\n\nThe facility covered by this RMP has had no reportable incidents or accidents in the past five years.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program, detailed in the facility's Emergency Contingency Plan, follows a logical sequence of hazard recognition, evaluation of degree of hazard, response actions by the Emergency Coordinator and First Responders"
