A safe and accident free workplace is the result of diligent work and ongoing attention to all company policies.\n\n\n\nAll TOLLC employees are knowledgeable of the safe work practices applicable to their area or job, and abide by them.  TOLLC employees perform their work with maximum regard for the safety of themselves, co-workers and the general public.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe 112(r) regulated flammable substances managed at the Red Wing Creek Gas Plant II facility include butane and propane.  Pressure vessels that contain regulated substances onsite include: \n\n1-120,000 gallon butane tank and 2-60,000 gallon propane tanks.  Additional tanks onsite include 1-120,000 gallon natural gas condensate tank and 1-120,000 gallon off-spec NG Liquids.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release was modeled using the EPA RMP Comp Model using butane.  Results of the modeling were calculated for a vapor cloud explosion and the complete failure of the tank (120, 000 gallons/577,200 pounds).  The predicted endpoint for this scenario is 0.7 miles under rural conditions.  These findings indicate that given the rural nature of the facility and the lack of public or environmental receptors, the regulated processes pose little risk to the general public or the environment in the event of fire or explosion.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTOLLC field personnel are provided various levels of training dependent on their overall job responsibilities.  This training is conducted per the appropriate OSHA regulations as are refresher classes.  Specific training programs may include respiratory protection, lockout/tagout procedures, worker right to know/hazard communication standard.  Additionally, personnel are knowledgeable as to the characteristics and hazards o"

TOLLC employees know in the event an emergency is identified the steps necessary to clearly communicate it to the supervisory personnel and the steps to take in the event of an accidental product release, fire or explosion.  TOLLC employees are trained in the proper use of chemical extinguishers during the incipient stage of a fire.  Inspections of the pressure vessels, fittings, lines etc. are performed as part of routine facility inspections by the TOLLC personnel.\n\n\n\nFive -Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility is newly constructed.  Therefore, this standard does not apply.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOperations personnel discovering a release, fire or explosion are to immediately notify the TOLLC designated shift supervisor by radio, telephone or by direct contact. These persons are authorized to initiate a response to any emergency reported to the Red Wing Creek Gas Plant II.\n\n\n\nDepending on the situation, procedures to be followed by the discovering employee(s) to mitigate the emergency may include:\n\n?    Stop the leak/release if it can be DONE SAFELY WITHOUT RISK.\n\n?    Shut upstream source off\n\n?    If fire has occurred, let vessel or line burn unless leak can be safely stopped.\n\n?    Evacuate all nonessential personnel and secure all ignition sources.\n\n?    No vehicles, smoking or any ignition source allowed in hazard area.\n\n?    Isolate hazard area and limit entry to emergency responders.\n\n?    Stay upwind and uphill away from release.\n\n?    Remain in a safe location until the designated supervisor arrives.  Assist with any immediate    response , containment, and equipment utilization as directed. Further secure the site from livestock and unauthorized persons.\n\n?    In the event of a spill or if heavy equipment is needed, contact appropriate contractor.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes in Safety Program\n\n\n\nGiven the remoteness of the facility, la"
