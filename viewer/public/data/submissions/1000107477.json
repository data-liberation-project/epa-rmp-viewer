The plant's location is approximately 4 miles south of Palermo, North Dakota and encompasses a land area of about 40 acres. \r\n\u00a0\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nAux Sable understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described herein. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the emergency response plan. The Palermo plant takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. Additionally, the plant has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\u000b\u000b\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nThe Aux Sable Midstream LLC facility is a natural gas liquids conditioning plant. The plant is designed to improve natural gas quality and make it suitable for pipeline transport. The gas plant receives gas from gathering systems that service nearby Bakken shale oil/gas production areas. The plant separates natural gas condensate from natural gas liquids. All other natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas are transported via the Prairie Rose pipeline to the Alliance Pipeline near Bantry, North Dakota for further processing off-site.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe facility produces quantities of methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, and a pentanes plus liquid (composed of pentane, iso-pentane, n-hexane, and heptane) in exce"
