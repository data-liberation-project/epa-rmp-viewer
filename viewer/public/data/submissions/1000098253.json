The Washington Transloading facility is a non-responding facility.\r\n\r\nThis facility is owned by SPM&T, however the transloading equipment is operated by Grammer, a contract operator.  SPM&T does not have full time employees officed at this location, but SPMT operations makes site visits as needed.  \r\n\r\nThe Terminal has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Energy Transfer looks for and seeks employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Washington Fire Department is contacted annually regarding participation in site emergency response drills which involve potential releases.   \r\n\r\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information regarding the management of the risks associated with the flammable substance storage process. Above all, SPM&T stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees, visitors and the community."

This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and eight (8)  33,600 gallon storage tanks detached railcars.  Washington Terminal can store up to eight (8) butane railcars at a time. \r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\r\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.\r\n\r\nSPM&T is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. SPM&T has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the Facility and community-wide and coordinates with the Washington Fire Department.\r\n\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a flammable liquid storage and distribution facility. Due to\r\nthe flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human\r\nexposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.\r\nThe Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and"
