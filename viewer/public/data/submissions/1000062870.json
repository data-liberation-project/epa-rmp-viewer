It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass water based batch reactions. We have four regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include 1) Carbon Disulfide, 2) Ethylenediamine, 3) Vinyl Acetate Monomer, and 2) Dimethylamine solution in water. The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses. The primary use of all substances is in producing additives for industrial cooling water treatment for prevention of disease causing bacterium and algae and industrial water treatment. They are also used to reduce harmful bacterial growth in the sugar manufacturing industry and in household detergents.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternate Case Scenarios including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used SLAB models and US EPA OCA look up tables.\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.
