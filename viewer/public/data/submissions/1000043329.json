This Facility stores fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural and industrial chemicals.  BEI Hawaii developed site specific Risk Management Plans for BEI Hawaii's facilities that are regulated under a risk management program to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and to protect public safety and environment.  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the public, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThis RMP consists of five chapters.  Chapter 1, Management, introduces the plan and describes the facility's operations, management and responsibilities.  Chapter 2, Off-Site Consequence Analysis Hazardous Assessment, provides hazard release consequences and impact in worst case and alternative scenario. Chapter 3, Five-Year Accident History Of Chlorine.  Chapter 4, Summary of Prevention Program, provides some safety information, hazard analysis, operation procedures, and prevention procedures.  Chapter 5, Summary of Emergency Response program.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBEI Hawaii believes in a clean and safe environment and is dedicated to meet all applicable environmental standards in the operation of its businesses and services.  BEI Hawaii has established comprehensive policies and procedures for the operations of its facilities.  BEI Hawaii is committed to environmental compliance that assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.  The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment, and to protect the environment from pollution.\n\n\n\nPreservation of the environment is a commit"

Employees shall promptly report suspected violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits to their supervisor who shall take immediate action to verify the report and, if confirmed, stop the violation and take remedial or other appropriate action.  The incident shall be promptly reported to BEI Hawaii Regulatory Compliance Manager, who will assist in making any necessary reports to regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nOverall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone's responsibility and working safely is a condition of employment. Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures. Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions and training.   \n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\n\n\nThe BEI Hawaii Maui facility is located at 300 Pakana Street, Wailuku, Hawaii 96793.  The facility stores pesticides, fertilizers and industrial chemicals.  The products are warehoused at the facility and distributed to various locations throughout the Maui Island.  The regulated substance handled at this storage/distribution facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is received in 150-lb and one-ton Department of Transportation (DOT) approved cylinders.  BEI Hawaii receives chlorine from a chemical supplier and distributor located on the west coast.  The chlorine supplier is responsible for container inspection and maintenance.  On average, the BEI Hawaii Maui facility stores one-ton cylinders (35 x 2,000 = 70,000 pounds) and 150-pound cylinders (40 x 150 = 6,000 pounds) for a total of 76,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  The facility maintains a Process Safety Management Plan"

The BEI Hawaii Process Safety Management Plan addresses:\n\n\n\n-  process safety information (includes information on first aid and medical management procedures for chlorine)\n\n-  process hazard analysis\n\n-  operating procedures (including safe handling procedures for storage and loading)\n\n-  training (including leak mitigation)\n\n-  contractors\n\n-  pre-startup review\n\n-  mechanical integrity\n\n-  hot work permits\n\n-  management change\n\n-  emergency planning and response (includes information on accident investigation and employee participation \n\n-  compliance safety audits\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has no reportable accidents during the last five years.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program \n\n\n\nThe BEI Hawaii Maui facility is classified as a non-responding facility.  As such, BEI Hawaii has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee/community safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response with an in-house response team.  The BEI Hawaii - Maui Facility has developed its own procedures as outlined in BEI Hawaii's Standard Operating Procedures for Chlorine. BEI Hawaii has coordinated response to incidents with the Maui Fire Department Hazmat Team.  Operators are capable, however, of responding to incidental releases such as routine tightening of a valve, for example. \n\n\n\nBEI Hawaii Maui branch personnel are trained to first responder operation level.  They are trained to respond in an operation level defensive mitigation measures (i.e., secure areas, initiate evacuation of personnel, etc.) to limit the release until a response team arrives to establish the incident command.  We have discussed this program with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Maui Fire Department.  In addition, BEI Hawaii has arranged with local response contractors to deal with potential releases at the facility.  \n\n\n\n"
