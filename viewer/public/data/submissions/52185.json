              "Description": "Aqueous ammonia 29% by weight, is stored in two tanks; tank #1 holds 6,000 gallons; and tank #2 holds 9,400 gallons.  Both tanks are in secondary containment units that will hold the contents of the largest tank.  The tanks are equipped with a vacuum/pressure breather valve, pressure safety valve.  Level indicators and level gauges are installed at the load in station.  A high level alarm is also installed in the tank and monitored at the DCS.  Procedures require that plant staff monitor transfers between delivery trucks and the storage tanks.\n\nNatural gasoline is used to denature the fuel grade ethanol.  The denaturant is stored in a 42,000 gallon tank.  Denturant will also be present at up to a 4.76% concentration in the two final product storage tanks. Each final product storage tank is capable of holding 503,000 gallons.  All three tanks are in a secondary containment unit that will hold the contents of the largest tank.  The tanks are equipped with a vacuum/pressure breather valve.  Pressure safety valves are installed on piping sections that could be isolated.  Local level indicators are present at the tanks farm.  A separate level indicator is monitored at the control room (DCS).  The DCS also includes alarms for high and high-high conditions.  Procedures require that plant staff monitor transfers between delivery trucks and the storage tanks.  Procedures are in place for all load out operations to rail cars and tanker truck.  Spill containment pads are installed at the truck and rail load out racks.  The load out scully's are equipped with level sensors that automatically shut off flow if a high level is indicated.",

      "SummaryText": "ACE ethanol is primarily a producer of fuel ethanol; secondary products include dried distillers grains, liquified carbon dioxide, dry ice and corn oil.  ACE Ethanol is committed to operating it's facility in a safe manner for the sake of both the employees and the surrounding community.\n\nACE Ethanol has two chemical products that are required to be included in this Risk Management Plan: aqueous ammonia and the natural gasoline that is used as a denaturant for ethanol.  Anhydrous ammonia is also present at the site, however the quantity stored and used on site has been reduced to lower the risk posed by this chemical.  ACE Ethanol has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify potential risks associated with the use and storage of these chemicals and has implemented the recommended changes that resulted from this PHA.\n\nDuring the 5 year reporting period, ACE Ethanol has not had a reportable release from the facility.  We believe that this record is largely due to the rigorous training program each of our operators and maintenance staff is required to complete prior to working independently within the facility.  This training includes written coursework, on the job training with experienced staff, and a final evaluation by supervisors and the Operations Manager.\n\nIn the event of a serious release from the facility, ACE Ethanol has coordinated response activities with the Stanley Fire Department, and Chippewa County.  Contract response services are also available from Waste Research and Reclaimation of Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
