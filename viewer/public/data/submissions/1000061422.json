Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nSaputo Cheese USA - Levin developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Saputo Cheese - Levin has a team that is trained in HAZWOPER Operations and 24-hour spill technician levels. Those trained to the spill technician level have been instructed in the use of Level C protection. Specific employees are also trained and certified as medical responders. All employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits, seismic assessments and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety and Risk Group will improve compliance and overall plant safety."
