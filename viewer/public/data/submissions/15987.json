Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n   \nHeinz Frozen Food Company's (HFFC) manufacturing sites comply with\napplicable federal, state and local regulations. As with all HFFC\nmanufacturing locations, this food processing facility has a formal\nworker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the\nworkplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances\nreceive proper training in the handling of those substances. This\nfacility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas\nin the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur,\nand to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis Heinz Frozen Food Company food processing facility is located at\n595 West 11th Street, Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Frozen prepared foods\nare produced at this location.  Food ingredients are received blended,\nmixed, cooked, baked, assembled, frozen and packaged.  The regulated\nsubstance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed loop\nrefrigeration system for product cooling and freezing. Ammonia is the\nmost effective, energy efficient and environmentally safe chemical for\nkeeping food at its proper temperature.\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia from the\nlargest vessel over a period of ten minutes.  The maximum quantity of\nammonia in the vessel is limited to 80percent of the total volume of\n13,840 pounds via written administrative controls, resulting in a\nrelease of approximately 11,000 pounds of ammonia. There are off-site\nimpacts under this worst-case scenario.\n\nThe alternate-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia vapor\nfrom a saf"

The relief valve is designed\nto vent ammonia to the atmosphere when its pressure rating is exceeded,\npreventing potential damage to other components in the refrigeration\nsystem.  The scenario results in a 325-pound ammonia release over a\nperiod of 18 minutes. There are no off-site impacts under the alternate-\ncase scenario.\n\nIf an accidental release of ammonia occurs, an Incident Investigation\nTeam is mobilized to determine the root cause of the release. The team\ndevelops corrective actions to prevent similar releases in the future.\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific\n    Prevention\n    \nAll Heinz Frozen Food Company manufacturing locations comply with the\nOSHA Process Safety Management for Highly\nHazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia.\nTherefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and\nmaintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Further, refrigeration\nsystem operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe\noperation of the refrigeration system. The ammonia refrigeration system\nat this facility has been designed and constructed using good\nengineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system\nincludes ammonia detection devices, high- and low-level switches in\npressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious\noverpressure. Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is\nensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.\nAnnual physical system audits are performed by an external\nrefrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity.\n\n5.   Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant\naccidental releases of ammonia.\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nAt this facility the primary emphasis is to safely evacuate all\nemployees in the event of an accidental release, pursuant to the\nreq"
