      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCity of Pflugerville (herein referred to as the City) owns and operates the Central \n\nWastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Pflugerville, Travis County, Texas. The plant is also \n\nknown as the Upper Gilleland Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility.  The City has reviewed its \n\nobligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean \n\nAir Act).  In response to these requirements, the City notes that there are two obligations \n\nincumbent on the operations at its facility:\n\n1. Section 112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty \n\nclause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity \n\nhas a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the \n\nevent of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  The City takes this obligation \n\nvery seriously, and intends to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community \n\nsafety and emergency preparedness. \n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The City operates a WWTP that stores and uses chlorine in excess \n\nof thresholds specified in the RMP Rule. Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP Rule, the \n\nCity management has been aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of \n\nchlorine, and has established programs to prevent accidental releases.\n\nChlorine is used to treat and disinfect municipal wastewater.  Chlorine is delivered as \n\ncompressed gases in one-ton cylinders.  Currently, the City has a maximum of six one-ton cylinders,\n\nor 12,000 pounds, of chlorine onsite at the WWTP at any one time.  This volume of chlorine allows\n\nthe City to treat up to 5.3 million gallons per day. The RMP rule requires one hypothetical\n\nworst-case scenario (WCS) to represent all regulated toxic substances in Program 2 processes.\n\nAdditional WCSs are required if a release from a process could impact different offsite receptors.\n\nThis plan includes one WCS for the chlorine process"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 1000022584,
      "SummaryText": ".\n\nIn addition to the WCS, the RMP rule requires one alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated\n\ntoxic substance in Program 2 processes.  Therefore, one ARS for chlorine is included in this RMP.\n\nThe City has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine releases.  \n\nIn addition, the City has maintenance, training, and inspection procedures currently in \n\nplace.  The City has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Travis \n\nCounty Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Travis County Regional HazMat \n\nResponse Team.\n\nThe City management is committed to:\n\n* Preventing accidents;\n* Training its employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n* Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n* Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with \n\nfacility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n* Being a responsible political subdivision of the State of Texas.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about the \n\nCity's management of the risks associated with the chlorine disinfection process, but more \n\nimportantly stresses the commitment to ensure a safe operation for employees, visitors, and \n\ncommunity."
