If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Liscomb Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer and chemical sales business.  We offer anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers for growing corn.  The ammonia plant consists of one 33,000 gal storage tank and one 12,000 gal storage tank plus associated piping and valves.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of both storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud.  According to EPA tables the end point is 6.9 miles.  Within the distance to the endpoint there is a popluation of 3505.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\n We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia storage, it is our policy to notify the Liscomb Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWe do not plan any additional changes."
