As\npart  of  this commitment, CFS has established a system  to  help\nensure  safe  operation of the processes at this  facility.   One\ncomponent  of  this system is a Risk Management Plan  (RMP)  that\nhelps  manage  the  risks  at  CFS and  that  complies  with  the\nrequirements  of  the Environmental Protection  Agency's  (EPA's)\nregulation   40  CFR  part  68,  Accidental  Release   Prevention\nRequirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nOne  of  the  requirements of the RMP rule is to  submit  a  risk\nmanagement  plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management  program\nat  CFS.   This  document  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  RMPlan\nrequirement  of  the RMP rule and to provide the  public  with  a\ndescription of the risk management program at CFS.\n\nThe RMP program at CFS consists of three (3) elements:\n1)   A hazard assessment to help understand:\n\n               The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical\n               accidental releases and;\n          l    accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years\n               associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule\n               (regulated substances).\n          \n2)   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the\n     processes  containing more than a threshold  quantity  of  a\n     regulated substance (covered processes).\n3)   An  emergency response program to help respond to accidental\n     releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this\nRMPlan.\n\nAlthough the RMP program at CFS helps provide assurance tha"
