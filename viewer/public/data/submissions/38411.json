In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCESS\n\nThe King's Delight Facility #4 / #9 are a poultry processing, freezing, and storage facility.  The facility uses ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system to maintain temperatures in three cold storage freezers. The refrigeration system is also used to \nfreeze poultry in 16 blast cells.  In addition to the cold"

      "SummaryText": " storage the facility houses a poultry-processing facility.  The ammonia \nrefrigeration system is used to maintain temperatures in the processing areas.  Ammonia refrigeration is the only process subject to the Risk Management Legislation.  The facility contains 59,000 pounds of the chemical in four systems.  The facility maintains a full time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple service inspections on a daily basis.  In addition there is a computer control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, and the atmosphere for leaks.  Any irregular condition will result in the activation of an automated paging system to contact refrigeration personnel.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases in the past five years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR \n1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain \na written emergency response plan.\n\nThis plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department. We conduct \nannual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and \nthe fire department. The last update of the facility's emergency response plan was on May 15, 2004."
