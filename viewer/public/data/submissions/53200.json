      "SummaryText": "Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC (GP), owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Conway, NC.  The facility is located on Ampac Road and is adjacent to the GP Hardboard plant which is now closed.  The resin facility consists of three plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1959, a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins, and a Spray-dry facility that dries resin manufactured by the resin plant.  The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1980. The Spray-dry facility was constructed in 1995.  Overall, the facility employs 84 full-time employees.\n\nGP is committed to operating the Conway, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Conway Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Conway Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Conway Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Conway Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n-a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n-a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than"

In fact, the Conway Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nGP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Conway Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, GP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GP trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GP works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Conway Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Conway Plant that are r"

GP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Conway Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Conway Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GP provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GP established a management system headed by the Plant Safety Committee Chariman / Process Safety Coordinator to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\nThe Conway Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  These include:   Formaldehyde & Ammonia.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nThe Conway Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a ?worst case release scenario? and an ?alternative release scenario?.  GP does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GP.  These requirements are:\n\n-one worst case release scenario in Program 3\n-one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  The OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1993, the Conway Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established one level of prevention requirements that apply to this facility:\n\nProgram 3?essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nThe following sect"

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  GP ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the LEPC, the Conway Fire Department, the Conway/Severn Rescue Squad, and the Northampton County Sheriff?s Office.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n-  toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n-  physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n-  reactivity and corrosivity data\n-  thermal and chemical stability data \n-  hazards of mixing substances in the process \n\nMSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the process control room so that the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, a list of chemicals is provided to the LEPC (or Local Emergency Agencies) and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.

A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the ?what-if checklist? technique to perform this analysis.
