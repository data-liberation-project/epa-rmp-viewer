Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  \nHuntsman?s Freeport Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The Huntsman Freeport Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, that implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman?s Freeport Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  \n\n2. Regulated Substances. \nHuntsman?s Freeport Plant is located within the boundaries of the DOW Chemical Company Freeport Plant A facility.  The Freeport Plant produces various Ethyleneamines which are sold to other companies for processing to a final consumer product.  There are three (3) regulated substances at the Freeport facility.  They are all on the toxic substances list and are:\n?Ethylenediamine (EDA) ? Final product.\n?Ammonia (anhydrous) ? Raw material.\n?Ammonia (aqueous) ? Raw material.\n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nEPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that might potentially affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  EPA?s computer Program, RMP*Comp, Version 1.07, was used to model the release scenarios.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case scenario is based on EPA required assumptions, is highly unlikely, and has never occurred at this facility.\n\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios  \nPer the RMP requirements, alternativ"

Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman?s Freeport Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n?Process Safety Information\nHuntsman?s Freeport Plant maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n?Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n?The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n?Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n?Process Hazard Analysis\nHuntsman?s Freeport Plant has performed Process Hazard Analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards, identify any previous incidents (that had likely potential for catastrophic consequences in the workplace), the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of increases.

The Freeport Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Freeport Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards, which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Freeport  Plant will complete a PHA Revalidation every 5-years meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards.\n\n?Operating Procedures\n    Huntsman Freeport Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n?Training\n    Huntsman?s Freeport Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n?Mechanical Integrity\nHuntsman?s Freeport Plant has developed a program for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.
