The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program are: (1) Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline), a flammable mixture, that contains butane, iso-pentane and pentane which are specific flammable chemicals regulated by RMP.  \n\n\n\nAccidental History\n\n\n\nThe plant has not had an RMP reportable incident involving the covered processes since startup of the facility in 2006.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nCarbon Green BioEnergy, LLC is commited to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Carbon Green BioEnergy, LLC's will continue to stive to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of RMP regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Level 3 Prevention Program and must comply with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP program requirements. Therefore, a formal PSM program has been implemented in addition to several safety and environmental programs.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nCarbon Green BioEnergy, LLC reviews and updates it written emergency response plan on an annual basis.  This plan includes responses for evacuation, fire and spill response, an SPCC and a Michigan PIPP.  The facility also has a SWPPP.  \n\n\n\nMost Carbon Green BioEnery, LLC employees receive initial training at the Haz-Mat Technician level a"
