To be compliant with the PSM regulations and now the EPA's RMP rule, Hercules, Inc.-Brunswick has implemented several layers of protection to prevent releases.\n\nThe first level of protection begins at the design stage.  Only the current, best engineering practices are used when designing new systems or modifying existing processes.  In addition, automatic shut-off devices as well as back up manual devices are designed into the process to reduce the likelihood of even a small leak or release.\n\nThe second layer of protection involves on-going maintenance and up-keep of the facilities and processes.  Hercules exerts tremendous efforts to maintain and upgrade the existing facilities to ensure safe operations.  All of the plant?s critical equipment (including tanks, vessels, piping, relief valves, instruments, etc.) are regularly inspected and tested to ensure safe operation.  \n\nThe third layer of protection involves the safe operation of the processes.  All operation and maintenance personnel receive intensive training and certification on the equipment, chemicals, and processes with which they are involved.  A special permit system is in place to control access and maintenance work in and around areas containing hazardous materials.  These permits require special checks and the signature of plant management before personnel access or maintenance can be performed in these areas.  \n\nThe last layer of protection involves auditing the operations.  Routine internal audits performed by Hercules-Brunswick personnel are conducted to verify that the processes are safe and environmentally sound.  In addition, external audits by personnel from other Hercules plants or offices, our customers, and various regulatory agencies, are conducted periodically.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nFacility Description:\n\nEstablished in 1912 (and headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware), Hercules Incorporated is a global manufacturer of chemical specialty products that are used in a variety of home, office and industrial products.\n\nHercules Incorporated purchased the Brunswick Plant in 1920 from the Yaryan Rosin Company.  The plant is situated on three hundred fifty (350) acres within the City of Brunswick.  With approximately three hundred (300) employees, the plant operates around the clock, seven days a week.\n\nThe Hercules-Brunswick Plant is nearly the only one of its kind in the world today that transforms abandoned pine stumps into industrial chemicals ultimately used in hundreds of consumer products, such as adhesives, sealant, chewing gum, toothpaste, citrus drinks, cleansers, and many other goods.\n\nIn making these products, the facility uses two (2) chemicals subject to the EPA?s Risk Management Program Rule.  These chemicals are hydrogen and trimethylchlorosilane.  Hydrogen is used to hydrogenate (add hydrogen atoms to) the resins extracted from the pine stumps.  Trimethylchlorosilane is used as a processing aid in the production of polymeric terpene resins.\n\nHydrogen is stored in a bulk storage tank with a maximum capacity of 12,400 pounds.  Trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) is handled in portable containers weighting 725 pounds.  While the number of TMCS containers onsite may vary at any one time, with the maximum number of containers exceeding the RMP threshold quantities, only one container is connected to the process at a time.\n\nPolicy:\n\nThe Corporate Policy on Safety, Health and Environment states:\n\nAt Hercules, we manufacture chemical specialty products.  We do so with full commitment to the chemical industry?s Responsible Care initiative.  In keeping with this commitment, we are dedicated to providing a safe and healthful environment for our employees, customers, and communities.  To do this, we are dedicated to and working toward c"

      "SummaryText": "orst-Case Scenarios:\n\nFollowing the process detailed in the EPA?s Off-Site Consequence Guidance, the off-site impacts were determined for each regulated substance utilized at Hercules-Brunswick Plant.   The Hercules-Brunswick Plant has one toxic chemical, Trimethylchlorosilane, and one flammable chemical, hydrogen that are in considered covered processes under the RMP rule.  The facility examined worst-case and alternative case scenarios for both chemicals using the EPA?s RMP*COMP program.  The chemical or substance that resulted in the most significant off-site impacts under the worst-case release scenario was Trimethylchlorosilane.  A hydrogen worst-case release scenario was also reported but its impacts were less than the toxic chemical. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for Trimethylchlorosilane is the instantaneous release of a 725-pound cylinder.  The impact of such a release using the EPA specified meteorological conditions would result in a vapor cloud that would reach off-site receptors.  No active or passive mitigation efforts were considered for the scenario.  \n\nAlternative Case Scenarios:\n\nThe alternate case scenario for Trimethylchlorosilane involves the release of half the contents of a cylinder (360 pounds).  More typical meteorological conditions for the Brunswick area were used such as those used by the alternative case guidance specified by EPA.  Such a release would result in minimal off-site impacts, just beyond the Hercules fence line.   \n\nThe alternate case scenario for Hydrogen would was a vapor cloud explosion that was released over 60 minutes at a release rate of 206 pounds per minute considering alternative case meteorological conditions as specified by EPA.  Such a release would result in minimal off-site impacts, just beyond the Hercules fence line.   \n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nEach of the processes, which uses one or more of the regulated substances, is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a"

This includes the use of process hazard analyses to identify and address potential hazards, management of change to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, operator training for the personnel involved in the process and contractor safety assessments to closely monitor activities by non-Hercules personnel.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, the Hercules-Brunswick Plant has not had any accidental releases of hydrogen or trimethylchlorosilane that have resulted in on-site injuries or any off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Hercules-Brunswick Plant has an emergency response program in place to minimize on-site, as well as off-site, impacts from the release of any of the regulated substances or any chemical utilized in the plant processes.\n\nWhile significant efforts are practiced to prevent all releases, Hercules is cognizant of the fact that they can and do occur.  To prepare to respond to a release, the plant has a very detailed emergency response program in place.  The key elements of this emergency response program are:\n\n-Written emergency response plans that provide a written step by step procedure for responding to the various types of emergency situations that may arise (fire, spills, hurricanes, etc).\n\n-Emergency response teams that provide twenty four hour, seven day a week response to spill or releases, fires and confined space entry emergencies.  The teams meet and train at least monthly and are manned primarily by employee volunteers.\n\n-Emergency response equipment for the teams to operate effectively.  Hercules is continually upgrading or purchasing new emergency response equipment that may be needed by the response teams.\n\n-Emergency response drills conducted periodically throughout the year.  Each response team practices what they have learned by conducting simulated i"
