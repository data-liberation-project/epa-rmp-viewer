              "Description": "Cryovac's highest priority is safety.  We use a system of safety devices, rigorous training, strict procedures, and integrated emergency response to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that might occur.                Safety controls include leak detectors, spill containment, alarms which automatically stop the process, and redundant safties on critical functions.   The following safety measures are in place: regular equipment inspection and preventative maintenance to ensure proper operation; implementation of PSM; E.A.T. training of all employees in job functions, safe operation, process controls, and emergency actions; written operating procedures and standards based on hazard risk assessment; a trained emergency response team to take control during an emergency situation; root cause investigationof all incidents to identify cause and appropriate corrective action; and regular audits of procedures, equipment, and systems by both Sealed Air and outside agencies.",

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nThe Cryovac Food Packaging Plant at Indianapolis has implemented an accidental release prevention policy, which integrates containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices.  All Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.  The Cryovac Emergency Response Policy involves side specific plans, which are detailed in the Emergency Operations Manual (EOM).  This includes a trained on site, around the clock Emergency Response Team, and procedures to notify the local fire authority.\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\n\n\n\nCryovac Food Packaging manufactures plastic foam packaging used in the food industry.  The plant uses pentane as a blowing agent to make plastic foam.  This is the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location.  Pentane (CAS 109-66-0) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline.  Pentane is used and stored as a liquid, but is released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n3.  THE WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\n    \n\nThe \"worst-case release\" scenario as defined by EPA assumes a rail car delivery    container completely fails, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditions        exist, the vapors find an ignition source and 10% of release explodes.  The               endpoint is at 1 psi overpressure is .37 miles.  The \"alternative release\" scenario         or more credible scenario is based on an analysis of potential hazards at our         facility.  Maximum release is 2000 gallons form a breach of a railcar or             catastrophic failure of the delivery piping.  The impact distance is based on maxi-        mum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have         serious consequences, .06 miles or in most cases, within our property lines.  The         impact distance in both cases h"

THE GENERAL CRYOVAC ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC     PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\n* E.A.T.  Training of operators\n\n* PSM process- completed HAZOP review of all stages of process\n\n* Spill containment and 30,000 gallons capture vault for unloading areas\n\n* Monitored double wall tanks and piping\n\n* Hydrocarbon sensor safety interlock system\n\n* Redundant alarms for potential upset conditions\n\n* Preventative maintenance program\n\n* Check-off sheet procedures for non-routine activities such as unloading or draining of     piping.\n\n* Use NFPA guidelines as a minimum standard for all fire protection systems.\n\n\n\nChemical - specific prevention steps include having detection meter calibrated to pentane and plant wide training on the properties, risks, and safe use of pentane.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. FIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORIES:\n\n \n\nThere have been four accidental releases over the past five years, all of which involved releases of less than one gallon.  There were no injuries, property damage or offsite consequences as a result of these incidents.  In place systems resulted early detection and mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response program incorporates an on-site Emergency Response Team fully trained and equipped for incipient fire fighting, awareness level hazmat response, confined space rescue, and first responder first aid.  Pre-plans, joint training and drills are coordinated with Pike Township Fire Department who is responsible to Marion County Hazardous Materials Planning Committee (LEPC) on a county wide mutual response. Emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n      \n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety and reduce risks have been implemented that were identified in the HAZOP review of PSM in 1994 and 1997.  Safety is an ongoing process and the highest priority"
