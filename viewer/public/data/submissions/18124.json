If Tim Hegarty is away from the facility at the moment of emergency, Stephen Dirkschneider will perform the role of the Emergency Coordinator, hereafter called the EC.\n\n\nThis plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from fires, explosions, and sudden and non-sudden releases of Propane and Anhydrous Ammonia occurring on the premises of the Elkhorn Valley Cooperative, Snyder, NE. Section 2 of the Risk Management Program, is where the Toxic Worst Case Scenario was run using RMP*Comp. Anhydrous Ammonia gas, liquefied by pressure was released. Quantity released was 80,000 lbs, with a release rate of 8000 lbs/min. Release duration was 10.0 mins, with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, and the atmospheric stability was a class F. Distance to the End point was 3.3 miles in an urban setting. Schools, residences, and commercial offices are going to be effected by this release of gas. Estimated population affected by this is going to be approximately 350 people. Emergency Shutdowns are installed at this location to prevent an accident such as this.\n\nAn Alternative Release was also run using RMP*Comp for Anhydrous ammonia, in which a transfer hose failed. Quantity released was 20,000 lbs at 4,000 lbs/min, for duration of 5 mins. Wind speed at this time was 3.0 m/sec, and atmospheric stability was a class D. Distance to the endpoint was 0.40 miles, affecting 200 people, with schools, parks, and commercial offices affected by this release. Excess flow valves and emergency shutdowns are installed at this facility to prevent an accident such as this.\n\nSection 4 and Section 5, of the Risk Management Program also addressed Worst and Alternative Case scenarios for Flammables, which are stored at this location. Worst Case scenario was run using RMP*Comp, in which there was a vapor cloud explosion. Quantity released was 56,000 lbs, and distance to the endpoint was .30 miles. Esti"

Emergency shutdowns are installed at this location to prevent a mishap such as this.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario was used using RMP*Comp. A propane release from a pipe caused a vapor cloud fire, with a release rate of 5580 lbs/min. Distance to endpoint was 0.1 miles, with a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour, and the atmospheric stability class was a D. Air temperature was 77 degrees, with 100 people affected by this release, including residences and commercial offices. Excess flow and emergency shutdown valves are installed at this location to prevent this accident from happening. \n\nThis plan is written specifically for the Elkhorn Valley Cooperative, Snyder facility. To get to this facility, go to 1st & Ash Street.\n\nRegular Season (Year Around) workdays are Monday through Saturday noon. Working hours are 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., during which time 3 employees are on site.\n\nAll plans are just that. Plans. The real emergency will be unexpected, and may very well be much different from what you anticipated. But certain things are fundamental to successful crisis management, whatever the scenario or whatever the problem.\n\nFor example, it's extremely important in any crisis that each employee be already aware of the provisions of the emergency plan, and of his or her pre-assigned role in carrying out that plan.\n\nFor some employees, that role is passive:  just staying put in the assigned rendezvous area, and being available for any task the EC may need to assign. This role is not to be taken lightly, because accountability is so important. In a crisis, a good manager strives to assure the well being of human life before doing anything else. If there's any doubt of the whereabouts of any personnel, then their well-being is also in doubt, and the manager has to devote precious time and resources to finding out. And time is the single most important factor in effective contro"

It can be either our best friend or our worst enemy, depending on how those first few moments must be used.\n\n\nFor other employees, the role may consist of alerting others of an emergency, helping all employees, contractors, and visitors move quickly and calmly to the rendezvous point, checking areas of the facility for missing persons, assisting the EC with mitigating tasks, familiarizing the incident commander with the facility, or another task assigned by the EC.\n\nSafety during an emergency can never be the sole responsibility of the EC. Each player must do his part, and is expected to contribute as directed by the EC. Your first contribution is to read and understand the Emergency Plan. And the EC's first duty is to make sure all employees read the Plan and indicate that they have read and understood the Plan.\n\nEach year the EC will select an appropriate time (preferably just before the busiest season) to create a simulated emergency, exercise the Plan, and assure its workability. If any shortcoming is found in either the Plan or its execution, the necessary amendments will be made at that time.\n\nThe EC will invite the local fire department, Dodge County Emergency Coordinator and the sheriff, and other potential support elements in the area to participate in this rehearsal. There is no chance of being too well trained or coordinated. Invite a representative of all outside participants to read the Plan.\n\nA real emergency is never going to be easy or predictable as the practice. The first person to arrive at the scene must react calmly and appropriately to the nature of the situation. It is imperative that each employee be familiar with the entire Emergency Action Plan so there can be a conditioned response consistent with the responsible actions outlined within the plan.\n\nThis is where the first person on the scene of an emergency must make a judgement call.

You will probably know which to call by how extreme the situation is.\n\nTime is the single most important factor in effective control of the crisis. The shorter the time from discovery of the emergency to implementation of emergency action, the lesser the consequences. Inversely, the longer the time from discovery to implementation, the worse the outcome will be.\n\nIt would be advisable to know what physical limitations such as heart problems or epilepsy that you or other employees might have that may complicate an emergency.\n\nAlways be alert to anything that could develop into an emergency. If you notice an emergency developing, and you know what has to be done and you have the tools, do it. But be prepared to implement emergency provisions set in the plan if your tools don't work.\n\nEach employee must understand in advance the exact steps to take at his or her workstation where any emergency could develop. Know the location of the closest fire extinguisher and in what situation it will be effective, where the nearest exit is, and the quickest way to get help.\n\nIf there are lives in danger and the situation is worsening, the lives in your hands are first priority. If a life can be saved without sacrificing your own and you have the resources, do it. If you don't think you can save the life with your own resources, get out and get help as quickly as possible. The idea is to get the victim out, not to get yourself trapped in there with them.\n\nOnce again, after the first person who arrives at the scene has declared an emergency and taken care of any injured persons, he or she must decide the severity of the emergency in order to notify the fire department first or the EC first. If the urgency of the situation requires the fire department, call them, then immediately fill the EC in on the specifics.

The alarm sound is a human voice giving a warning of an emergency. The initial rendezvous point is in the area East of the office. Get the names of any unaccounted-for personnel immediately, along with whatever is known about their last known location within the facility. This accountability includes not only employees, but also visitors, customers, salesmen, and contractors on the site. Everyone, including visitors and contractors, will be logged in or out of the area. In an emergency, don't count on being able to remember where people are.\n\nThe EC will retain control over the situation until professional emergency responders arrive. The EC will personally view the emergency and assess possible hazards. The EC and personnel most familiar with the building or accident scene need to stay available to provide information to the incident commander as needed.\n\nYou can count on the media arriving to cover the story. No employee, even the EC, should discuss the situation with anyone. All inquiries should be directed to the Incident Commander.\n\nIf much time passes before the emergency responders arrive, then the EC must assure that individuals unaccounted for are found and safely relocated, that the injured receive appropriate first aid, and that the perimeter of the scene is secure to keep onlookers away from danger.\n\nAs soon as the emergency response team arrives, brief the Incident Commander on all the previous events and let him or her direct mitigating activities from that point on. The Incident Commander and the EC should work together to bring the emergency under control and assure the safety of everyone in the area.\n\nCheck on status of personnel.

Do not put this off. An incident diary will help you recall every detail of the events that happened.\n\nPeople in the rendezvous area may be moved to another location now if necessary.\n\nTake all reasonable measures to assure that the problem does not recur, and that the condition that brought on the emergency does not exist elsewhere. If it is known or suspected that a similar condition exists elsewhere, fix it. Also at this time, any spent emergency equipment should be replaced, or cleaned and repaired, and returned to its proper position. If replacement is not immediately practical, make other arrangements before resuming operations, and advise all affected personnel of the change."
