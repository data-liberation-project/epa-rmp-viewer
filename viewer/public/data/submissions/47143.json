      "SummaryText": "This document has been assembled to facilitate Minnesota Diversified Products, Inc. (DiversiFoam) in fulfilling the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  These programs are intended to prevent releases and minimize the consequence of releases of certain hazardous chemicals.\n\nDiversiFoam manufactures rigid polystyrene boardstock by both the foam extrusion and molded expandable polystyrene (EPS) bead processes.  DiversiFoam also manufactures custom-molded and custom-cut EPS foam parts.  Other activities include cutting and shaping pre-manufactured urethane, repairing equipment in a machine shop, and lamination of other products onto foam products using hot-melt adhesives.  The foam extrusion process uses methyl chloride as an expansion agent.  OSHA and EPA have identified methyl chloride as a toxic substance requiring specific handling and care as described by the PSM and RMP standards respectively.\n\nThe PSM and RMP requirements are similar, but there is one notable difference.  PSM places an emphasis on employee safety, while the emphasis of the RMP is on protecting the surrounding community and environment.  Due to DiversiFoam?s chemicals and processes, the PSM and RMP standards require the following elements be addressed for the covered processes:\n\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n?    Standard Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Contractors\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Hot Work Permit\n?    Management of Change\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Emergency Planning and Response\n?    Compliance Audits\n?    Trade Secrets\n\nThe first portion of this manual, Section 1.0 (1.1 through 1.14), is structured to address and meet the requirements of the PSM standard with respect to the methyl chloride at the facility.  The second portion of this manual, Section 2.0 (2.1 through 2.7), is str"
