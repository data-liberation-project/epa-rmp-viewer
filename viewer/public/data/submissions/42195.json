At the Buckbee-Mears Company (BMC) facility, chlorine, which is a listed substance, is stored in a quantity greater than the threshold quantity of 2,500 pound (lb).  The BMC facility, formerly known as the Buckbee-Mears Cortland facility, had previously submitted its initial RMP in June 1999 and subsequently submitted a revised RMP in April 2000.  In 2004, the operations at the Buckbee-Mears Cortland facility were discontinued and the facility de-registered its RMP in June 2004.  However, the facility has since been sold to a new owner and plans to startup operations in March 2005.  \n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 68, Subpart G, 68.150-68.190.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.10(d)(2), since chlorine is subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910), Prevention Program 3 requirements apply to these operations.  \n\nA hazard assessment consisting of one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario for chlorine was completed for BMC.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68, as well as guidance provided by USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) document.\n\nThe facility manufactures aperture masks that are sold to the television and computer industries.  The chlorine is received in 90-ton railcars.  The chlorine is store"

      "SummaryText": "d as a liquid under pressure.  From the railcars the chlorine is transferrred to chlorine vaporizers, pressure reduction equipment and then to the aperture mask production lines for regeneration of the ferric chloride etchant under vacuum.\n\nThe Chlorine Institute provides the basis of design for BMC's chlorine storage and supply system.  Personnel responsible for operating and maintaining this system have been trained in the hazards of the system, how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions, and in written procedures.  The procedures were prepared in accordance with Process Safety Management Requirements and 40 CFR Part 68 requirements.  Refresher training, both in the classroom and on the job, is provided every three years from the date of last training.  \n\nPeriodic inspections of the chlorine storage and supply system are conducted.  The frequency of these inspections is based on the manufacturer's and Chlorine Institute's recommendations, and may be more frequent based on facility experience and schedule.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine resulting in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred at the facility in its history.\n\nThe facility has an existing emergency response plan that incorporates emergency response and coordination procedures for chlorine.  The fire department and local emergency planning committee are included in this contingency plan.  The facility is also part of the Cortland County Emergency Response Plan.\n\nBMC is committed to ongoing improvements and implementation of additional safety measures as appropriate and as they become available."
