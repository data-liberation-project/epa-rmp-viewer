      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Sky Lake Water Treatment Plant (Sky Lake  WTP) is owned by the Orlando Utilities Commission. The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.  The OUC Corporate Environmental Department provides advice and funding on hazardous chemical emergency issues.  The OUC Response to chlorine emergencies for the water plant is coordinated through the Water Production Division Pershing Control Center, from which all OUC Water Plants are controlled and managed. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Sky Lake  WTP is located on at 502 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, Orange County, Florida.  Sky Lake WTP adds chlorine in their chlorination process in order to disinfect the City's water supply.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twenty one-ton containers at the Chlorination process building.   Five one-ton containers are on-line at one time feeding the system with five on standby when those are exhausted.   There are ten more one-ton containers in storage.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 40,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is fully enclosed in a building. \n\nThe chlorine building at Sky Lake is equipped with an automated chlorine scrubber system.  The scrubber system is activated by two chlorine detectors which are located inside the building, one in the chlorine dock area and one in the chlorination room.  If the chlorine detectors indicate that chlorine is present at a concentration above the preset level, the doors and louvers of the building will automatically close and the scrubber will start.  The scrubber fan will pull the released chlorine gas through the scrubber, which chemically removes the chlorine from the air.  The scrubber can handle a full one-ton container of chlorine before the scrubbing medium is exhausted.  The chlor"

      "SummaryText": "ine detectors are also interlocked to an audible and visual alarm at the site and audible and visual alarms on the Operator's control panel at the Pershing Control Center.  The Control Panel will also indicate to the operator that the scrubber has started.  When the Operator sees the chlorine alarm, he can dispatch OUC personnel and City or County emergency response personnel to the site immediately if necessary.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, however this is an unmanned site and does not is therefore not subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Sky Lake WTP Chlorination process in the Program 2 level.  The Sky Lake facility will address all elements for the Prevention Program 2 as required by the RMP rule.\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, Process Safety Information,  Preventative Maintenance Program, and Operating Procedures.   Compliance Audits, Safety Training, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4.Accident History\n\nThe Sky Lake facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Pershing Control Center has an Emergency Response Procedure in place.  The Plant Operator at the Pershing Control Center has accident assessment capabilities and can respond immediately to all emergencies by dispactching appropriate personnel to the site.  The OUC Water Production mechanics have been trained in chlorine safety and have a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine.  The current procedure has been coordinated with the Orange County Fire Departmen"
