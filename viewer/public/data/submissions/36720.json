We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program are included in the Prevention Program, level 3\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility packages high purity laboratory, microelectronic, and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.  Our facility also accomplishes limited purification operations and some aqueous blending operations.  The Mallinckrodt Baker facility consists of a single building, approximately 350,000 square feet, and encompasses warehousing and packaging operations as well as unloading facilities for rail cars and tank trucks.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals - Chloroform\n\nThe worst case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the bulk receiving vessel, resulting in the loss of the entire contents, 46,000 lbs. in ten minutes.  Liquid spilled will be contained in a diked area from which the vapors can be blanketed and the spill cleaned up.  Vapors from the evaporating liquid will be dispersed downwind with the plume width being approximately 200 feet.  The estimated distance to the 92 ppm exposure endpoint is 0.4 mile (2100 feet).  The offsite impact would include approximately 150 individuals located along a street to the west and in a subdivision to the north.  Additionally, a business directly across the highway to the south, and farmland to the east would be affected.\n\nThe unloading area is in a containment area which will hold the entire contents of the vessel and provides an area in which a spill could be covered to minimize evaporation and cleaned up.  Pressure testing of the vessels, video surveillance, operator observation, and periodic inspection of the unloading systems minimize the likelihood of this event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals - Chl"

      "SummaryText": "oroform\n\nThe alternative scenario is a leak occurring at the point where the unloading line is connected to the bulk vessel.  This would lead to Chloroform leaking into the containment dike and beginning to evaporate.  It is expected that, should this scenario occur, the duration will be a maximum of 1 hour.  The distance to the 92 ppm exposure endpoint is estimated to be less than 0.1 mile (528 feet) which will have no offsite impact.\n\nManagement systems in place requiring the operator to frequently walk the lines to check for leaks as well as the utilization of video surveillance, remote E-stop switches, and positive tie down of the hose fittings minimize the potential for this scenario to occur.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals - Ethyl Ether\n\nThe worst case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) following the catastrophic failure of the bulk vessel at its maximum volume of 48,000 lbs.  The estimated distance to the 1 psig overpressure endpoint is 0.1 mile which would produce no offsite impact.  Based on this analysis, Ethyl Ether is a Program 1 material and no alternative release scenario is required.\n\nThe unloading vessel is periodically pressure tested in accordance with DOT requirements which will minimize the likelihood of this event occurring.\n\nThe unloading system is periodically inspected, the area is under video surveillance, the systems are controlled by remote shut off valves for early shutdown, and all electrical systems in the area are hazard rated for the area.  These systems for early leak detection and shut off and the electrical systems combine to minimize the potential for a leak occurring undetected and subsequently being ignited to produce a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nW"

OFF SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS\n\nIntroduction\nThe PHAST Professional software (version 5.22) was used to predict release conditions, emission rates, and downwind ground level concentrations, as appropriate, for toxic and flammable materials.  PHAST was developed and is distributed by DNV Technica.  The PHAST model is a state-of-the-art tool commonly used in the chemical and petrochemicals industries to evaluate the consequences of hazardous material spills and releases.

The greatest quantity contained in any tank or pipeline is the volume of a tank truck, 46,000 pounds.  In the worst case scenario, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface, in this case, a concrete containment dike.  The total quantity spilled is assumed to cover the diked area instantaneously.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the release of the contents of the chloroform tank truck into a 2,000 sq ft concrete dike and subsequent evaporation and downwind transport.  To simulate the ?instantaneous? formation of the liquid pool, the release was modeled by assuming tank contents were released through a 48? diameter hole.  The vapor release during the 0.86 minute period of tank emptying was ignored.  No credit was taken for other active or passive controls to mitigate the worst case releases.\n\nThe endpoint for Risk Management Plan offsite consequence analysis for toxic compounds is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline-2 (ERPG-2) value.  The chloroform ERPG-2 value is 92 ppm.\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled assuming worst case meteorological conditions.  The ambient temperature was assumed to be 96?F, the highest hourly reading recorded by the US National Weather Service at the Louisville, KY airport for the 1995-1997 period.  The wind speed and stability were assumed to be 1.5 meters per second and Pasquil Class F as required by the RMP Rule.  Relative humidity was assumed to be 73%, the average value for the three year period.  A surface roughness length of 0.17 meters was used in the PHAST dispersion calculations.  This value is representative of woods, rural areas, and industrial sites.\n\nPHAST predicts that worst case ground level concentrations will exceed 92 ppm to a distance of 0.4 miles.  Approximately 150 people live within this distance.  No schools, hospitals, "

The RMP rule requires that offsite consequences of more probable alternative scenarios be evaluated for each toxic material handled above threshold quantities.\n\nRepresentative meteorological conditions for alternative release scenarios were established by inspection of the (1995-1997) meteorological record: average wind speed ? 7.7 miles per hour, average ambient temperature - 54?F; average relative humidity ? 73%, and most frequent stability class ? D.\n\nThe most likely cause of chloroform release is the failure of a transfer hose or piping system component.  If the failure of a transfer hose went undetected, the tank truck would empty, the spilled material would be contained in the dike, and chloroform would evaporate from the resultant pool.  This scenario differs from the worst case scenario only due to the use of alternative scenario meteorological conditions.\n\nPHAST predicts that downwind concentrations following release of the total contents of a chloroform tank truck under alternative meteorological conditions will exceed 92 ppm to a distance of 0.1 miles.  This distance does not extend beyond the nearest plant boundary.  No residents or other sensitive receptors are located within this distance.\n\nDiethyl Ether (Flammable)\nDiethyl Ether is a flammable liquid stored at ambient temperature and pressure.  The greatest quantity contained in any tank or pipeline is the volume of a rail car, 48,000 pounds.

No credit is taken for active or passive controls other than the containment dike to mitigate the worst case release.\n\nAs in the case of chloroform, ?instantaneous? formation of the liquid pool was modeled by assuming tank contents were released through a 48? diameter hole.  PHAST predicts that a total of 3853 pounds of diethyl ether will be volatilized in the ten minutes following the release.  EPA?s RMP Comp model was used to evaluate the consequences of the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nRMP Comp predicts a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.1 miles.
