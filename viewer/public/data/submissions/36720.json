              "Description": "We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n?Process safety information (PSI)\n?Process hazard analysis\n?Operating procedures\n?Training\n?Mechanical integrity\n?Management of change\n?Pre-startup review\n?Compliance audits\n?Incident investigation\n?Employee participation\n?Hot work permit\n?Contractors\n\nThese individual elements of our accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the highest standards for accident prevention.\n\n2.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n In accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, we systematically control the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our risk management program.  We also use this information directly to ensure that our equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\n2.1 Process Safety Information Details\n\nWe maintain the following chemical process information where appropriate for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and non-covered processes:\n\n?Toxicity information\n?Permissable exposure limits\n?Physical data\n?Reactivity data\n?Corrosivity data\n?Thermal and chemical stability data \n?Hazardous effect of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur\n\nWe use material safety data sheets (MSDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information.  Whenever required information, such as corrosivity data or hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, is not available in MSDSs, we attempt to develop the missing data from other sources and provide it in separate documents.\n\nWe maintain the following required process technology information:\n\n?Block flow or simplified process flow diagram\n?Process chemistry\n?Maximum intended inventory\n?Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, or composition\n?Evaluation of the consequences of deviations from established operating limits\n\nMost of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes, but in some cases, we have developed such information through special projects.  Additionally, operating limits, maximum intended inventories, and consequences of deviations not available from engineering design documentation were developed as part of PHAs.\n\nWe also maintain the following information pertaining to equipment in our regulated processes:\n\n?Materials of construction\n?Piping and instrument diagrams I(P&ID?s)\n?Electrical classification\n?Relief system design and design basis\n?Ventilation system design\n?Design codes and standards employed\n?Material and energy balances for processed built after 6/21/99\n?Safety systems (interlocks, detection, and suppression systems)\n\nAgain, most of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes as well as from our own maintenance files.  Whenever required information was not available, we obtained the information from equipment vendors, process designers, plant engineering, and/or research and development departments.  In conjunction with our equipment information collection efforts, we documented that our equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  For our older processes, where design information is obsolete, our Engineering Department and Safety Department evaluated the existing design against appropriate safety criteria and documented that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\n3.0 PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, we use process hazard analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.  The most important products of our PHAs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  We ensure that all recommendations from our PHAs are resolved appropriately, and we ensure that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\n3.1 Process Hazard Analysis Details \n\nWe have conducted systematic PHAs of processes at our facility.  We (1) address each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or offsite population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes).  We also conduct PHAs of new processes before those processes are placed in service.\n\nWe primarily use the what if / checklist technique to perform PHAs, although we may use other EPA-/OSHA-approved techniques when they are more appropriate for specific applications.  We conduct our PHAs consistent with the procedures presented in the American Institute of Chemical Engineer?s (AIChE?s) Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures ? Second Edition with Worked Examples and address the following: \n\n?Hazards of the process, both process related and personnel related\n?Identification of any previous incident that had a potential for catastrophic consequences\n?Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships\n?Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls\n?Stationary source (plant) siting\n?Human factors\n?Qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n?Inventories in the process\n\nOur PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering, process operating, and safety experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be evaluated and a PHA team leader trained in the application of the hazard evaluation technique used for the PHA.\n\nWe have a system in place to promptly resolve PHA team findings and recommendations, and we communicate findings/recommendation resolutions to potentially affected personnel.  PHAs are implemented in a written report for each analysis soon after the analysis meetings are completed.  Our managers review and resolve the PHA recommendations after receiving the report.  We maintain a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date.  Documentation of the final resolution of each recommendation, either completion or rejection and why is maintained.\n\n4.0 OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, we use operating procedures and work instructions to define how process-related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.  We use these procedures to (1) train our employees/ contractors before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n\n4.1 Operating Procedure Details  \n\nOur process engineers, operators, supervisors, department managers, and the EH&S Manager work together to develop and maintain our operating procedures for all phases of operations including:\n\n?Initial startup\n?Normal operations\n?Temporary operations\n?Emergency shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n?Emergency operations\n?Normal shutdown\n?Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown\n\nWe use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, our own experience, and interviews with other operators to create and validate the procedures.\n\nOur procedures address the following information:\n\n?Steps for safely conducting activities\n?Safe operating limits\n?Consequences of process deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations\n?Safety and health considerations including (1) properties of, and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment, (3) control measures to be taken if physical contact or airborne exposure occurs, (4) quality control for raw materials and control of regulated substance inventory levels, and (5) any special or unique hazards\n?Safety systems and their functions\n\nIn addition to our process-specific procedures, we also develop and maintain more widely applicable safe work practices addressing issues such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, control of access to processes, overall safe work practices guidelines, incident investigations, safety reviews, and management of change.  These safe work practices apply to our employees and our contractors.\n\nWe have a formal review process to approve procedures and changes to procedures.  Furthermore, we review existing procedures, make any needed revisions, and certify the procedures as current and accurate.  We keep our procedures in locations that are readily accessible to employees who may need the procedures.\n                                                                                                                          5.0 TRAINING\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule, we train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training (written tests, field demonstrations,observations, etc.).\n\n5.1 Training Details \n\nWe provide our operators with initial and refresher training, which includes a general overview of the process, properties of chemicals in the process, and safety and health hazards, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  We provide initial training to new hires or newly assigned employees before they are allowed to work independently as operators.\n\nPeriodically, we provide our operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedure training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced (beyond HAZCOM) chemical-specific training.  Our refresher training emphasizes process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and startup following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group.  Our operators are consulted on the refresher training, and their input is considered when preparing the training.\n\nAll training is accompanied by some form of evaluation to verify that our training has been understood.  We use a combination of physical demonstration of skills and oral reviews using a one-on-one format.  We review the information missed by an employee who does not pass all testing requirements, and we do not allow resumption of work until minimum testing requirements are met.\n\nAll training is documented and includes the employee?s name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n6.0 MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP rule, we maintain the mechanical integrity (MI) of our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and a quality assurance program, and we ensure that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly.  We train our maintenance personnel in the hazards of the process, and we also provide additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of our process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.\n\n6.1 Mechanical Integrity Details \n\nWe consider all process-related equipment and safety systems that are critical for preventing and/or mitigating releases of regulated substances to be covered by our MI program.  Examples include:\n\n?Pressure vessels and storage tanks\n?Piping systems including valves\n?Relief and vent systems and devices\n?Emergency shutdown systems\n?Controls such as monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks\n?Pumps\n\nOur MI program uses equipment surveillance, preventive maintenance activities, and manufacturer?s manuals and recommendations to identify equipment that needs repair or replacement before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return deteriorated equipment to acceptable specifications.  We maintain written procedures that support our MI program as follows:\n\n?Our plant operating procedures specify functional tests that operators must perform on specific equipment, as well as procedures to remove equipment from operation for maintenance or return equipment to service following maintenance.  Also, any temporary operation for continuing safe operations when certain equipment deficiencies occur is handled through our management of change procedure.\n\n?Our standard maintenance procedures describe the methods that mechanics use to perform repairs, replacements, and installations.\n                                                                                                                         Our procedures for safe work practices and safety policies specify safe practices for performing maintenance tasks such as lockout/tagout, hot work, confined space entry, line or equipment opening, and control over entry/exit for a covered facility by plant and/or contract maintenance personnel.\n\n?Our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance procedures describe the methods used by mechanics to perform inspections, test, and preventive maintenance tasks on process equipment.  These procedures follow generally accepted good engineering practices.  The equipment inspection and test frequency is based on mean time to failure estimated provided by the manufacturer, adjusted by our own experience.\n\nWe document all inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities including:\n\n?Date of inspection, test, or preventive maintenance\n?Person performing the activity\n?Equipment identifier\n?Description of the activity performed\n?Results of the activity (including any deficiencies noted)\n\nWe identify equipment deficiencies through our inspection, test, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly.  If we cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, we implement protective measure using our management of change procedures to ensure safe operation until repairs can be made.\n\nWe have a quality assurance program that addresses new facilities, equipment, maintenance materials, and spare parts.  Our program seeks to verify proper fabrication of new equipment, proper installation of new or repaired/replaced equipment, and use of suitable maintenance materials and spare parts in the preventive maintenance and repair tasks.\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program covering all MI issues.  Our program uses the procedures described previously.  For example, all mechanics, maintenance supervisors, and plant engineers are trained on hazards for all RMP-covered processes and on safe work practices.  Our maintenance personnel also receive training on safe maintenance procedures, preventive maintenance practices, and special skills requiring craft certifications.  All training, as described above, occurs before employees perform tasks in RMP-covered areas independently.\n\n7.0 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule, we evaluate and approve all proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through our management of change (MOC) program.  This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, drawings and process safety information is updated, appropriate process hazards analysis and pre-start up safety reviews are completed, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that our employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.  We use this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\n\n7.1 Management of Change Details \n\nWe analyze each proposed change and confirm that:\n\n?The technical basis for the change is appropriate\n?The safety and health impacts of the change are understood and appropriate controls are in place\n?The procedures are modified as appropriate for the change\n?The permissible time period is established for temporary changes\n?The change is authorized by appropriate personnel\n\nOur MOC procedure contains a step-by-step description of the confirmation process.  It defines and provides examples of changes and replacements in kind.  Also, it describes in detail the requirement for each confirmation step based on the type of change being considered.  We use a Request for Change Review and Approval Form to document each step in the confirmation process.  Changes that pass the confirmation criteria are communicated to our employees and contract employees who are affected by the change before the change is implemented.  When approved changes required updates to our process safety information and/or operating procedures, we revise these documents and train employees on these changes before operations resume.  All training is documented as formal operator training.\n\n8.0 PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, we perform a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.\n\n8.1 Pre-Startup Review Details \n\nWe perform pre-startup reviews on new stationary sources and on modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information or operating procedures.  Our pre-startup review is completed before regulated substances are brought into the process and only after we have confirmed that:\n\n?Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n?Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate \n?PHAs have been performed on new stationary sources and all recommendations have been resolved\n?MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes\n?Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees\n\nWe use an established pre-startup safety review format as an aid in documenting the performance of our pre-startup reviews.  Our format contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to startup.  The person responsible for the project or maintenance task schedules the Pre-Startup Safety Review and determines the names of the persons to be involved in the review.  As part of the review process, corrective actions are identified, responsibilities assigned, and due dates established.  The corrective actions are divided into two categories, those of a critical nature that must be completed before the process may be started up, and those that may be completed after startup but by an established due date.  Those actions that have the potential to affect the safety of the process or personnel or create an environmental impact are always assigned to the critical category.\n\n9.0 COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, we audit our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n9.1 Compliance Audit Details \n\nWe conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.  The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:\n\n?Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68)\n?Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\n?Capability to document audit results\n?Knowledge of the process to be audited\n\nOur audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit.  They use a protocol or a checksheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses or non-compliances are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\n\nThe EH&S Manager and the manager of the affected area promptly review the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored until pen issues are resolved.  We retain the two most recent audit reports.\n\n10.0 INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with the potential for personal injury, property damage, or environmental impact are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.  \n\n10.1 Incident Investigation Details \n\nWe investigate all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a release of hazardous material, serious injuries to our employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment.  We train our employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur.  We initiate an investigation within 24 hours utilizing an investigation team consisting of:\n\n?At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved\n?A contract employee if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract employees\n?Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event \n\nWe train our investigation team leaders in investigation techniques, including root cause analysis.  The investigation team follows a written investigation protocol that addresses the key steps of fact finding, determination of cause, and development of recommendations/actions to be taken.  From the raw data collected, the incident investigation team prepares the text for an incident summary report, which contains:\n\n?Date and time of the event\n?Date and time the investigation started\n?Description of the event\n?Identification of causes and contributing factors\n?Recommendations from the investigation including assignment of responsibility for corrective action and due dates\n\nWe resolve the report recommendations and develop action plans that are tracked to completion.  We review the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract employees, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings.  We accomplish this review through a combination of routing a copy of the approved report to potentially affected employees (and contract employees) and by discussing the event at the next safety meeting.  We retain incident reports for at least five years.\n\n11.0 EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\n11.1 Employee Participation Details \n\nWe have a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements.  IN this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations.  We periodically review this document and updates are made, as appropriate.\n\nWe consult with the employees on ways to improve participation in the RMP.  Periodically, in our safety meetings, we review results of PHAs and resolutions of their recommendations.\n\n12.0 HOT WORK PERMITS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, we use our hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA?s fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (any work in any area of the facility having the potential to create sparks) begins.  The types of hot work covered are welding, cutting, soldering, and use of power hand tools.\n\n12.1 Hot Work Permit Details \n\nThe site Hot Work program includes procedures which meet the fire prevention and protection regulation 29 CFR 1910.252(a).  A Hot Work Permit Form is used to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, duration of the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed.  We distributed the Hot Work Procedure and Sample Hot Work Permit Forms to employees in safety meetings and used a workshop approach to train all employees who may use or enforce a hot work permit activity.  New employees who may be involved in hot work are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.  Our department supervisors audit completed Hot Work Permit Forms and forward them to the EH&S Manager to ensure that any errors in preparation or approval are identified and brought to the attention of those involved to prevent recurrence.  Hot work being performed in the facility is periodically observed to insure the presence and accuracy of the Hot Work Permit form.\n\n13.0 CONTRACTORS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP rule, we have a contractor screening and orientation procedure to help ensure that we hire an use only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of our plant employees, the public, or the environment.\n\n13.1 Contractor Details \n\nWe have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, in the facility.\n\nWe select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process.  This information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker?s compensation insurance experience).  Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration.  Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged on who can do a quality job at the lowest cost.  If a contractor currently working in our plant is under consideration, we review recent safety audits and contact our people on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before we authorize the purchase order.  A listing of approved contractors is maintained at the site.\n\nWe provide a safety orientation for all contractor employees before they begin work on-site.  We use the orientation meeting to familiarize contractors with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.  We provide a contractor orientation booklet that describes (1) the plant? hazardous chemicals, including toxic, fire/explosion, physical, and chemical properties, (2) safe work practices in use at our facility, and (3) actions they must take in the event of a plant emergency.  We provide copies of our Contractor Orientation Manual, which contains plant safety rules/policies, safe work practices, a material hazards summary, and an outline of emergency actions for contractors.  MSDS?s are available for our hazardous materials in numerous locations within the facility.  The EH&S Manager, Business Managers, and the Project Coordinator routinely monitor the contractor?s work area and practices to insure the facility safety requirements are being met.\n\nWe require our contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:\n\n?Train each of their employees in the work practices necessary to safely perform the contracted work\n?Promptly report any near misses that may have occurred to the EH&S Manager\n?Train each of their employees on our plant?s safe work practices\n?Document that each of their employees has received and understands the training noted above\n?Ensure that each of their employees follows our plant safety rules and safe work practices\n?Report to our staff any hazards created or found by their employees at the job site\n?Provide access and responses to our personnel who may appear at the job site to evaluate contractor safety performance\n?Provide information on contract employee job site injuries/illnesses to the EH&S Manager",

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program are included in the Prevention Program, level 3\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility packages high purity laboratory, microelectronic, and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.  Our facility also accomplishes limited purification operations and some aqueous blending operations.  The Mallinckrodt Baker facility consists of a single building, approximately 350,000 square feet, and encompasses warehousing and packaging operations as well as unloading facilities for rail cars and tank trucks.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals - Chloroform\n\nThe worst case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the bulk receiving vessel, resulting in the loss of the entire contents, 46,000 lbs. in ten minutes.  Liquid spilled will be contained in a diked area from which the vapors can be blanketed and the spill cleaned up.  Vapors from the evaporating liquid will be dispersed downwind with the plume width being approximately 200 feet.  The estimated distance to the 92 ppm exposure endpoint is 0.4 mile (2100 feet).  The offsite impact would include approximately 150 individuals located along a street to the west and in a subdivision to the north.  Additionally, a business directly across the highway to the south, and farmland to the east would be affected.\n\nThe unloading area is in a containment area which will hold the entire contents of the vessel and provides an area in which a spill could be covered to minimize evaporation and cleaned up.  Pressure testing of the vessels, video surveillance, operator observation, and periodic inspection of the unloading systems minimize the likelihood of this event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals - Chl"

      "SummaryText": "oroform\n\nThe alternative scenario is a leak occurring at the point where the unloading line is connected to the bulk vessel.  This would lead to Chloroform leaking into the containment dike and beginning to evaporate.  It is expected that, should this scenario occur, the duration will be a maximum of 1 hour.  The distance to the 92 ppm exposure endpoint is estimated to be less than 0.1 mile (528 feet) which will have no offsite impact.\n\nManagement systems in place requiring the operator to frequently walk the lines to check for leaks as well as the utilization of video surveillance, remote E-stop switches, and positive tie down of the hose fittings minimize the potential for this scenario to occur.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals - Ethyl Ether\n\nThe worst case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) following the catastrophic failure of the bulk vessel at its maximum volume of 48,000 lbs.  The estimated distance to the 1 psig overpressure endpoint is 0.1 mile which would produce no offsite impact.  Based on this analysis, Ethyl Ether is a Program 1 material and no alternative release scenario is required.\n\nThe unloading vessel is periodically pressure tested in accordance with DOT requirements which will minimize the likelihood of this event occurring.\n\nThe unloading system is periodically inspected, the area is under video surveillance, the systems are controlled by remote shut off valves for early shutdown, and all electrical systems in the area are hazard rated for the area.  These systems for early leak detection and shut off and the electrical systems combine to minimize the potential for a leak occurring undetected and subsequently being ignited to produce a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nW"

OFF SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS\n\nIntroduction\nThe PHAST Professional software (version 5.22) was used to predict release conditions, emission rates, and downwind ground level concentrations, as appropriate, for toxic and flammable materials.  PHAST was developed and is distributed by DNV Technica.  The PHAST model is a state-of-the-art tool commonly used in the chemical and petrochemicals industries to evaluate the consequences of hazardous material spills and releases.

The greatest quantity contained in any tank or pipeline is the volume of a tank truck, 46,000 pounds.  In the worst case scenario, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface, in this case, a concrete containment dike.  The total quantity spilled is assumed to cover the diked area instantaneously.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the release of the contents of the chloroform tank truck into a 2,000 sq ft concrete dike and subsequent evaporation and downwind transport.  To simulate the ?instantaneous? formation of the liquid pool, the release was modeled by assuming tank contents were released through a 48? diameter hole.  The vapor release during the 0.86 minute period of tank emptying was ignored.  No credit was taken for other active or passive controls to mitigate the worst case releases.\n\nThe endpoint for Risk Management Plan offsite consequence analysis for toxic compounds is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline-2 (ERPG-2) value.  The chloroform ERPG-2 value is 92 ppm.\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled assuming worst case meteorological conditions.  The ambient temperature was assumed to be 96?F, the highest hourly reading recorded by the US National Weather Service at the Louisville, KY airport for the 1995-1997 period.  The wind speed and stability were assumed to be 1.5 meters per second and Pasquil Class F as required by the RMP Rule.  Relative humidity was assumed to be 73%, the average value for the three year period.  A surface roughness length of 0.17 meters was used in the PHAST dispersion calculations.  This value is representative of woods, rural areas, and industrial sites.\n\nPHAST predicts that worst case ground level concentrations will exceed 92 ppm to a distance of 0.4 miles.  Approximately 150 people live within this distance.  No schools, hospitals, "

The RMP rule requires that offsite consequences of more probable alternative scenarios be evaluated for each toxic material handled above threshold quantities.\n\nRepresentative meteorological conditions for alternative release scenarios were established by inspection of the (1995-1997) meteorological record: average wind speed ? 7.7 miles per hour, average ambient temperature - 54?F; average relative humidity ? 73%, and most frequent stability class ? D.\n\nThe most likely cause of chloroform release is the failure of a transfer hose or piping system component.  If the failure of a transfer hose went undetected, the tank truck would empty, the spilled material would be contained in the dike, and chloroform would evaporate from the resultant pool.  This scenario differs from the worst case scenario only due to the use of alternative scenario meteorological conditions.\n\nPHAST predicts that downwind concentrations following release of the total contents of a chloroform tank truck under alternative meteorological conditions will exceed 92 ppm to a distance of 0.1 miles.  This distance does not extend beyond the nearest plant boundary.  No residents or other sensitive receptors are located within this distance.\n\nDiethyl Ether (Flammable)\nDiethyl Ether is a flammable liquid stored at ambient temperature and pressure.

No credit is taken for active or passive controls other than the containment dike to mitigate the worst case release.\n\nAs in the case of chloroform, ?instantaneous? formation of the liquid pool was modeled by assuming tank contents were released through a 48? diameter hole.  PHAST predicts that a total of 3853 pounds of diethyl ether will be volatilized in the ten minutes following the release.  EPA?s RMP Comp model was used to evaluate the consequences of the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nRMP Comp predicts a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.1 miles.
