This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the ammonia refrigeration system's design, operation, and maintenance. Lineage's policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \nProgram 3 at Lineage Logistics\u0097Vernon 1-3 is a facility-run program that operates under the continuous support and guidance of the Lineage Safety and Compliance Department, including Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance, ensuring comprehensive safety measures are in place.   \n\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nLineage\u0097Vernon 1-3 is situated at 3141 East 44th Street, Vernon, California, in an area predominantly characterized by commercial and industrial activities. The regulated substance handled at our facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is used exclusively as a refrigerant in our large-scale public storage of food products.  \nThe facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAs part of implementing the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage \u0097Vernon 1-3, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over 10,000 lbs\u0097the federal EPA RMP and OSHA PSM threshold.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia-covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA PSM an"
