These one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas \nare stored in a room isolated from the rest of the Treatment Plant by a 2-hour fire wall. The room is connected \nto a chlorine scrubber unit. The chlorine scrubber unit is connected to the Plant's emergency power generator.\n\nThe storage room also contains an overhead sprinkling system and an audible and visual alarm system that is \nalso connected to the Plant's emergency power generator.\n\nPlant operators follow a safety procedure to never enter the chlorine storage room without a second operator\nobserving through an observation window. The operators are trained to handle any \"incidental\" release of the\nchlorine. An \"incidental\" release is defined as a release that can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled\nat the time of release by employees in the immediate release area or where there is no potential safety or \nhealth hazard (i.e., fire, explosion or chemical exposure).\n\nAny uncontrolled releases will be handled by the Wellington Fire Department and the Sumner County LEPC.\nTheir phone, radio and pager numbers are visibly posted at the Plant in case there would be an emergency.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario had a 2.2 mile radius impact area. The \"realistic\" release scenario had a\n0.2 mile radius impact area. Information supplied by the Sumner County Appraiser's office indicated about \n104 residences in the \"worst-case\" radius impact area, which is about 300 affected persons and there are \nabout 50 affected persons in the \"realistic\" release scenario.\n\nThe City's prevention program is centered around continual training, sticking to safety procedures, preventative\nmaintenance on the chlorine handling equipment and yearly inspections by the Wellington Fire Department\nand  Sumner County LEPC.\n\nThere have been no uncontrolled releases at the Well"
