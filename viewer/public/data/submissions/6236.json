The Wiggins Coop Inc., Policy.\n\n     The management and employees of Wiggins Coop Inc., County Line facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the Wiggins Coop, is working to put in place a memodandum of understanding with the local fire department, to respond to and mitigate any release thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at this site is that of storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for application.  The maximum quantity handled would be 140,196 pounds in one storage vessel {30,000 gallons - 140,196 pounds}.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenerio and the Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     The worst case release scenerio would be the release of the total contents of the storage vessels, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is 1.16 miles.\n\n     The alternate release scenerio is based on the likely potential incident which is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The Wiggins Coop Inc., has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any"

The WIggins Coop Inc., has trained our employees and is working with the Wigging fire department to develope a response plan in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planning Changes To Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
