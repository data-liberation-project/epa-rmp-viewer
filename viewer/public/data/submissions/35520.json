The same properties that make these substances valuable as fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them.  Such precautions help to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personnel health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these substances, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Sturgis Station, located near Keyes, OK, produces petroleum products from natural gas.  The facility has several regulated flammable substances, such as butane and pentane, which are contained in flammable mixtures handled and stored on site.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThis section was removed for security reasons.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility is subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  Thus, the prevention program currently implemented at the facility for processes subject to the EPA?s risk management program includes all of the aspects of PSM.  Specifically, the prevention program includes all of the elements listed below.\n\n1.  Employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.\n\n2.  Process Safe"
