The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors as appropriate.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, Lost Pines 1 will conduct a compliance audit every three years.  The plant will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\r\n\r\nAdditional Safety Systems\r\nLost Pines 1 has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.  These systems include:\r\n\r\n* Redundant instrumentation to monitor critical process parameters\r\n* Redundant critical equipment\r\n* Automated shutdown systems\r\n* Pressure relief valves\r\n* Water deluge system to wash ammonia vapors from the air\r\n\r\nLCRA/GenTex continuously evaluates the safety systems and operating procedures associated with the covered process to determine if there are ways to improve safety.  If an improvement is found, LCRA/GenTex will take steps to evaluate and implement it in a timely manner.  \r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe Lost Pines 1 Power Plant began commercial operations in May 2001.

Information concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical area classificaiton, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, material and energy balances and safety systems.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nLost Pines 1 has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the regulated process are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, general industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that recommendations resulting from this anaylsis are resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nLost Pines 1 maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including; initial startup, routine startup and shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, routine operation, and temporary operation.

Because some contractors may work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter in the course of their work.  The plant also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLost Pines 1 has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process  and critical safety equipment, (2) development of written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correction of identified deficiencies, and (6) application of quality assurance measures to ensure that replacement equipment meets applicable specifications.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits\r\nLost Pines 1 has an active hot work program in place to ensure worker and process safety.  The hot work permit program is designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area.
