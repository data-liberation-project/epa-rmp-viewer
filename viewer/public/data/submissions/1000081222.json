However, several changes are captured in this update as follows.  Note:  this facility was previously owned and operated by Dow Chemical.  A change of ownership notification was submitted on 03/08/19.\n\n\n\na) 310 Block Operations:\n\n\n\n- Added a unit operation within the 310 Block Operations that handles hydrogen fluoride as a covered process due to interconnectivity.  The 310 Block Operation was already covered due to hydrogen fluoride.  The inclusion of the unit operation did not increase the hydrogen fluoride inventory nor did it change the WCS or ARS.  \n\n\n\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \n\n\n\nb) 640 Block Operations:\n\n\n\n- Updated the worse case scenario for aqueous ammonia.  The updated WCS for aqueous ammonia does not have any off-site impact and does not supersede the current WCS (SO2) for the site.\n\n\n\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \n\n\n\nNote: Unit Operations included in Federal RMP due to interconnectivity rule.  Section 1.17 includes actual inventory (below threshold quantity).\n\n\n\n- 310 Block Operations [Chlorine]\n\n- 520 Block Operations [Hydrogen Chloride]\n\n- 560 Block Operations [Chlorine]\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCorteva Agriscience, Pittsburg Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Pittsburg Operation's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Pittsburg Operations.

Pittsburg Operations is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at Pittsburg Operations is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Pittsburg Operations has six regulated substances present at the site.  These substances include ammonia (aqueous), ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nPittsburg Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Pittsburg Operations was designed and constructed in accordance with RAGAGEP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nPittsburg Operations maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.  This information is regularly reviewed, as needed, and is readily accessible to plant operation"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis (RC/PHA), Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Reactive Chemical Reviews, and Project Safety & Loss Prevention Reviews.  Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Pittsburg Operations' covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to plant operations personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nPittsburg Operations has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.

Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nPittsburg Operations hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Pittsburg Operations has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform Pittsburg Operations of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nPittsburg Operations has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases due to the site's release prevention policies.
