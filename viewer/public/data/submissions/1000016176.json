      "SummaryText": "Shoreline Southeast LLC is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTo assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG), and oil from various field wells.  High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the electric cooler.  The electric cooler condenses the gas so that LPG liquids drop out. The LPG liquid is stored in one 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 200 psig.  The LPG is removed from the facility  by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in two bulk atmospheric storage tanks (400 barrels each) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing LPG and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances: 156,000 pounds of LPG and 92,400 pounds of condensate\n\nThe LPG and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for LPG and pentane"

The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
