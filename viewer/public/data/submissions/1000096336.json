This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Layton City Fire Department and the Davis County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity. Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Layton Dairy processing operations. Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Layton Dairy is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nLayton Dairy has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. To meet these necessary requirements Layton Dairy has implemented their Process Safety Management / Risk Management Plan programs through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as EPA's RMP Standard, 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the Layton Dairy facility within the last five years that have resulted in on-site or off-site property damage, injuries or deaths.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nLayton Dairy's current Emergency Action Plan focuses on"

      "SummaryText": "evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nLayton Dairy currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time. However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Layton Dairy personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
