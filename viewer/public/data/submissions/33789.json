Hisco has reviewed its obligations under EPA?s Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act).&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to these requirements, Hisco notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at its facility:\n\n1. ?112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hisco takes this obligation very seriously, and intends to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan ? Hisco stores ammonium hydroxide, which contains ammonia in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP Rule, Hisco management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the storage of ammonium hydroxide, and has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nChemicals are stored at Hisco prior to being distributed to other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ammonium hydroxide is delivered as a liquid in 55-gallon drums, and there are approximately 160 drums of ammonium hydroxide, which amounts to approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia, at the facility at any one time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn the past five years, Hisco has not experienced any accidents involving an RMP chemical at its facility. For planning purposes, Hisco has considered a very conservative (i.e., ?worst case?) release scenario and a more realistic alternative release scenario.\n\nHisco has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mit"

Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n? Being a good corporate citizen of Travis County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan update provides information about Hisco?s management of the risks associated with the warehouse and distribution process, but more importantly Hisco stresses their commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and the community.\n"
