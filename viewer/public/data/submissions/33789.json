Risk Management Plan \u00bf Hisco stores ammonium hydroxide, which contains ammonia in excess of thresholds specified in \u00a7112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP Rule, Hisco management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the storage of ammonium hydroxide, and has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nChemicals are stored at Hisco prior to being distributed to other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ammonium hydroxide is delivered as a liquid in 55-gallon drums, and there are approximately 160 drums of ammonium hydroxide, which amounts to approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia, at the facility at any one time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn the past five years, Hisco has not experienced any accidents involving an RMP chemical at its facility. For planning purposes, Hisco has considered a very conservative (i.e., \u00bfworst case\u00bf) release scenario and a more realistic alternative release scenario.\n\nHisco has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mit"
