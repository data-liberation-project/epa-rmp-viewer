              "Description": "Releases are prevented by designing for safety, maintaining for safe operation, monitoring for safe operation, operating safely, and by auditing for safety.\n\nWays which the facility designs for safety include conducting hazard studies to identify potential release scenarios and assess safeguards, completing hazard studies for design changes, maximizing employee participation in design work, designing components with multiple automatic safety shutdowns, building emergency shutoff valves into the process and transfer systems, maintaining computer software designed for process and emergency shutdowns, having chemical systems designed to stop process reactions quickly, having fire fighting equipment strategically located in the plant, and ensuring that emergency escape routes from the units are maintained.\n\nWays which the facility maintains for safety include operating a preventive maintenance program for tanks, equipment, and piping, conducting routine mechanical inspections to determine that metal thickness is adequate over the life of the equipment, routinely testing emergency shutdown devices and safety systems, checking sensors as part of a preventive maintenance program, and using mandatory checklists to ensure equipment is opened for repair without creating releases.\n\nThe facility monitors for safety include operating 16 chemical gas sensors, which detect leaks at low levels.  Sensors sound alarms to warn workers and many are designed to automatically shutdown the process area in a safe state.\n\nSome of the ways, which the facility operates for safety, include employing highly trained, knowledgeable, process safety certified operators.  The operators are trained through the use of detailed operating procedures.  Many operations are computer controlled and monitored, and the process has emergency shutoff valves, which can be controlled from several locations.  Additionally, video cameras are used to watch key areas and high pressure/temperature/level alarms are used wherever required.\n\nSome of the ways, which the facility audits for safety, include performing process safety audits by in-plant and corporate personnel, conducting in-plant audits, conducting operations and safety inspections regularly, and by routinely investigating incidents/accidents and near-misses.",

              "Description": "Releases are prevented by designing for safety, maintaining for safe operation, monitoring for safe operation, operating safely, and by auditing for safety.\n\nWays which the facility designs for safety include conducting hazard studies to identify potential release scenarios and assess safeguards, completing hazard studies for design changes, maximizing employee participation in design work, designing components with multiple automatic safety shutdowns, building emergency shutoff valves into the process and transfer systems, maintaining computer software designed for process and emergency shutdowns, having chemical systems designed to stop process reactions quickly, having fire fighting equipment strategically located in the plant, and ensuring that emergency escape routes from the units are maintained.\n\nWays which the facility maintains for safety include operating a preventive maintenance program for tanks, equipment, and piping, conducting routine mechanical inspections to determine that metal thickness is adequate over the life of the equipment, routinely testing emergency shutdown devices and safety systems, checking sensors as part of a preventive maintenance program, and using mandatory checklists to ensure equipment is opened for repair without creating releases.\n\nThe facility monitors for safety include operating more than 42 chemical gas sensors, which detect leaks at low levels.  Sensors sound alarms to warn workers and many are designed to automatically shutdown the process area in a safe state.\n\nSome of the ways, which the facility operates for safety, include employing highly trained, knowledgeable, process safety certified operators.  The operators are trained through the use of detailed operating procedures.  Many operations are computer controlled and monitored, and the process has emergency shutoff valves, which can be controlled from several locations.  Additionally, video cameras are used to watch key areas and high pressure/temperature/level alarms are used wherever required.\n\nSome of the ways, which the facility audits for safety, include performing process safety audits by in-plant and corporate personnel, conducting in-plant audits, conducting operations and safety inspections regularly, and by routinely investigating incidents/accidents and near-misses.",
