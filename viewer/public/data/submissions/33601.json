This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\nIntroduction;\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\nFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\nPrevention program;\nFive-Year Accident History;\nEmergency Response Plan; and\n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns to ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  Employees and contractors carry through this emphasis on safety to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement to safety.\nHES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Atofina?s commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nThe ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. Axis, Alabama plant is located on Highway 43, approximately 7 miles north of exit 19 on Interstate 65.  The facility"

Certain substances used within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at, or above, the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.  The chemicals that we use, which are covered by the RMP requirements include Chlorine and 1,3-Butadiene.  These chemicals are the building blocks (raw material) for some of the plant?s major products.  Atofina knows that these and other chemicals that we handle are hazardous and/or flammable.  We handle these chemicals with a great deal of care and respect.\nThis facility is subject to Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The facility also handles chemicals that are subject to OSHA 1910.119 (Process Safety Management).  In 2001 the facility applied for inclusion in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and met the requirements to be recognized as a STAR site.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nReleases are prevented by designing for safety, maintaining for safe operation, monitoring for safe operation, operating safely, and by auditing for safety.\nWays which the facility designs for safety include conducting hazard studies to identify potential release scenarios and assess safeguards, completing hazard studies for design changes, maximizing employee participation in design work, designing components with multiple automatic safety shutdowns, building emergency shutoff valves into the process and transfer systems, maintaining computer software designed for process and emergency shutdowns, having chemical systems designed to stop process reactions quickly, installation of fixed sprinkler systems flammable chemical storage and handling areas, specially designed explosion suppression systems, having fire fighting equipment strategically located in the plant, and ensuring that emergency escape routes from the units are maintained.\nThe facility maintains for safety by operating a preventive "

Sensors sound alarms to warn workers and many are designed to automatically shutdown the process area in a safe state.\nThe facility operates for safety by employing highly trained, knowledgeable, process safety certified operators.  The operators are trained through the use of detailed operating procedures.  Operations are computer controlled and monitored, and the process has emergency shutoff valves, which can be controlled from several locations.  Additionally, video cameras are used to watch key areas and high pressure/temperature/level alarms are used wherever required.\nThe facility audits for safety include performing process safety audits by in-plant and corporate personnel, conducting in-plant audits, conducting operations and safety inspections regularly, and by routinely investigating incidents/accidents and near-misses.\n  \nEmergency Response Plan\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility.  The emergency response measures to be taken for RMP release scenarios has been incorporated into the facility emergency response plan.  The facility actively participates with the Greater Mobile Emergency Planning Committee (GMEPC) to coordinate emergency response training and drills at the plant site.  Selected elements of the plan are incorporated into the Mobile County Emergency Action Plan, which is maintained by the GMEPC.  The fa"

The facility prepares by having employees participate in drills and training for emergency response, attending annual fire training at professional fire schools, having fire/spill response equipment ready, having an emergency response team on-site 24 hrs/day, providing contractors with training on plant safety systems and process information, providing employees with medical/ first responder and rescue training.  Supervisors and key employees also receive additional incident command and spill response training.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no RMP releases in the last five years (i.e. no on-site or off-site injuries, property or environmental damage, or off-site evacuations resulting from a chemical release)."
