The Risk Management Program included Ronson's practices to come into compliance with respect to the regulations promulgated under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).\n\nThe following aspects of the RMP were evaluated and are described in more detail throughout the report:\n\n              *Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the facility\n              *The handling of the stationary source and regulated substances\n              *Worst case release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures\n              *General accidnetal release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n              *The five year accident history\n              *The emergency response program\n              *Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in this report as well as documented as Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs). The stationary and regulated substance is isobutane (A-31). SOPs and other handling procedures are discussed throughout the RMP and are currently in place at Ronson Facility. The worst case and alternative scenarios will be discussed further and prevention steps are presently in place. There have been no accidents reported at the Ronson facility with regards to the regulated substance. An emergency response program is currently in place and is discussed in more detail throughout the report."
