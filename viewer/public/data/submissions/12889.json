All incidents, including those with the potential to cause any injury or damage, are investigated.  The RMP Program regulations require the reporting of accident histories involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.  There have been no accidents involving ethylene oxide, sulfur dioxide, 1,3-butadiene or chlorine that have resulted in injury or property damage onsite or offsite in the last five years at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPenford maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of any hazardous substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition Penford has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties including sheltering-in-place and evacuation.  Penford employees that may be involved in a threatened or actual chemical spill response are required to complete a certified 24-hour course in Industrial Chemical Spill Response.  These personnel must recertify annually with an 8-hou"

Penford workers will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, workers evacuate the area and contact the Cedar Rapids Fire Department.\n\nPenford's emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Penford plant processes or other Penford plant facilities.  The emergency response program is included in the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training effected personnel in the changes.  The emergency response program is managed using ISO-compliant practices to ensure that all changes to the program are readily available and properly updated.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Penford is coordinated with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department and the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Penford has been an active member of the committee and has worked with the Linn County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) in developing and exercising the county-wide Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan (Annex P).  Penford has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) and LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Penford conducts periodic emergency drills for all facility personnel and has worked with both the LEPC and emergency response organizations on county-wide chemical emergency response training.  Penford involves local responders in refresher training on the hazards of regulated substances in the Penford facility. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Im"

Corrective action taken in response to the audit team's recommendations is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Penford have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at Penford.  Collectively, these prevention programs help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.  \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Penford has installed safety features on many process units to help quickly detect a release, contain/control a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The safety features listed below are in use in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms and process interlocks\nChlorine and other chemical-specific detectors with alarms and process interlocks\nVideo monitors and 24-hour security\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\nProcess relief valves that discharge to scrubbers or contained locations\nScrubbers to neutralize releases\nAutomatic and manual valves to permit isolation of process components\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\nCurbing or diking to contain releases\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., backup power supply, backup pumps, etc.)\nAtmospheric release devices\n\nRelease mitigation\n\nFire suppression and extinguishing systems\nDeluge systems\nTrained emerge"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \n\n11. Incident Investigation\n\nPenford promptly investigates all incidents and near misses at its facility.  A team-based approach is typically utilized to ensure an in-depth, unbiased investigation is conducted.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, prioritizes recommendations, and assigns responsibilities.  An action item database is maintained to ensure corrective actions are completed on a timely basis and appropriate documentation is maintained.  All incidents/near misses and corrective actions are shared with all affected personnel to help minimize the potential for recurrence.  The well-managed incident investigation process serves as a valuable input for the period hazard analyses.\n\n12.

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternate release scenarios (ARSs).  Regulated substances are characterized as being either flammable or toxic.  Computerized models are utilized to determine the distance (endpoint) to which certain effects might occur to the public as a result of an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Worst-case and alternate-case scenarios provide the input data for these computer models.  The endpoint distance for flammables is the distance from the epicenter of an explosion to the point where the overpressure is reduced to 1 pound per square inch (typically causing no more serious effects than window breakage).  The endpoint for toxics is that distance from the release where the maximum airborne concentration of the regulated substance is below the concentration that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe RMP rule requires Penford to include data on one worst-case release scenario for flammables and one worst-case release scenario for toxics.
