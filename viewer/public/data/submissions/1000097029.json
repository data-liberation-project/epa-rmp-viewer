The facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes through the site Safe Work Permitting process.  A Daily/Shift Safe Work Permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n3.3  Chemical Specific Release Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nEDCC has instituted the following measures to prevent accidental releases from the following regulated substances used or produced at the facility:\r\n\r\n3.3.1  Nitric Acid and Ammonia\r\n\r\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of nitric acid or ammonia.  These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  pH probes and alarms are located throughout the plant's storm water system to alert staff of accidental spills or releases.\r\n\r\n\t3.3.2  Oleum\r\n\r\n\tProcess controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.  The tank is installed with a vacuum breaker, sumps that pump lost solution back to the process and a scrubber with an induced draft blower to collect all vents and remove any vaporized sulfur trioxide by dissolving it in water to form sulfuric acid.  The sulfuric acid is returned to the process.  A concrete dike surrounds the tank and is sufficient to contain the entire release of vessel contents.\r\n\r\n3.4  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief summary of significant accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP Regulated Toxic Substances during the previous five year"

These audits are carried out at least every three years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\t\r\n\t3.2.9  Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nEDCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\n\t3.2.10  Employee Participation\r\n\r\nEDCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
