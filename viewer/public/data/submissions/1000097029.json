The facility uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  EDCC maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including the following:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by the EPA's RMP Rule;\n\n?    A summary of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases;\n\n?    An overview of accidental release prevention programs and chemical specific prevention steps;\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule;\n\n?    An overview of the Emergency Response Program; and,\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\n3.1  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n    EDCC's primary activity involves the production of ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid.  These products are used extensively in the agricultural, mining, specialty chemical manufacturing, and forestry products industries.  From a consumer's viewpoint, these products are used in the manufacture of paper, water treatment chemicals, computer chips, and even blue jean dye to name a few applications.  The facility uses or manufactures the following chemicals that EPA has listed on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list, and that are stored above threshold quantities:\n\n\n\nChemical    Process"

Also, EDCC parallels the RMP Rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility.\n\n\n\n    3.2.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nEDCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n    3.2.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\n    The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"HAZOP\" and/or the \"what if\" checklist.  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n    3."

These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  pH probes and alarms are located throughout the plant's storm water system to alert staff of accidental spills or releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.3.2  Oleum\n\n\n\n    Process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.  The tank is installed with a vacuum breaker, sumps that pump lost solution back to the process and a scrubber with an induced draft blower to collect all vents and remove any vaporized sulfur trioxide by dissolving it in water to form sulfuric acid.  The sulfuric acid is returned to the process.  A concrete dike surrounds the tank and is sufficient to contain the entire release of vessel content"

The date of the most recent tabletop exercise was October 6, 2020.  \n\n\n\n3.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nEDCC is actively promoting public awareness and education programs concerning emergency response through the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Community Advisory Panel.  This education process enhances the public's ability to respond in a given emergency situation.  EDCC continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  A list of proposed future improvements is as follows:\n\n\n\n?    Continue the partnership and education process with local fire departments to ensure fire department personnel are knowledgeable of site specific processes, materials and products and, as necessary, assist \n\n        them in updating a site specific fire plan; and,  \n\n?    Provide continued EMT training to employees and on-site confined space rescue team.\n\n\n\nEDCC realizes the improvements listed above are necessary for improving safety and emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n\n"
