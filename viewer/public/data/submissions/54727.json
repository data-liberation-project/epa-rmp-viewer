This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED::\nThe facility is a commercial dairy producing fluid milk product.The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for product, process and space cooling. The refrigerant system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, evaporative condensers, support equipment, piping and valves.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility has developed, implemented and maintained a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\nClose cooperation with the Fire Department for emergency response training.\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\nPlant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\nPeriodic Safety Meetings.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no reportable releases of ammonia or accident involving the refrigeration systems during the past five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The \"Facility Emergency Action Plan\" has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38.
