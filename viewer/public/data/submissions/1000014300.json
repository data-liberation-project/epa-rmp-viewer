              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM -- CHLORINE DIOXIDE  Stone Container Corporation, Panama City has a OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place covering its chlorine dioxide operations. This PSM program meets the requirements of the RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the Panama City facility's RMP. The PSM program was audited in July 2005 and the program was found to be effective and being practiced. The entire chlorine dioxide generator and associated equipment has been changed to a new state-of-the-art process in 2000. The old process was removed from service. A process hazard analysis for the chlorine dioxide system was conducted and all items that were identified as a concern have been addressed.  The mill maintains current copies of the MSDS for all operating and maintenance employees to use in determining the required safety action they need to take in working with chlorine dioxide. These MSDS's are posted on the mill computer network and in written form in a central location.  There are up-to-date operating procedures that relate to the chlorine dioxide system. These procedures address the hazards of chlorine dioxide and how to safely complete the required task. Specific subjects that are addressed are:     Initial startup,     Normal operations,     Temporary operations,     Emergency shutdown and operations,     Startup after an emergency shutdown,     Normal shutdown,     Startup after a normal shutdown,     Startup after a change to the system that required a hazard review,     Consequence of a deviation and steps to correct or avoid the deviation,     Equipment inspections  All employees that work with or maintain the chlorine dioxide process and equipment have been trained in the correct procedures for their area of activity. Refresher training is conducted as often as necessary to insure employees are operating or maintaining the system according to current procedures and are adhering to the current procedures. The refresher training will include safety and the hazards of chlorine dioxide and avoidance of unsafe conditions.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years.  Written procedures are maintained for insuring the ongoing maintenance, inspections and checking of the integrity of the chlorine dioxide system equipment. There is a training program for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of the chlorine dioxide system equipment to insure that each employee can do the job in a safe manner. P.M. inspections are conducted using the Panama City's maintenance department's programs, forms and procedures.  Any incident that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine dioxide will be investigated. All employees are required to report all chlorine dioxide related incidents and document the incident using the mill Form. This form as related to a release of chlorine dioxide and its use will be a part of the safety training each employee involved in operation and maintenance of the chlorine dioxide system will receive.  An incident investigation team approach is used to investigate any reported release.The facility procedures establish that prompt addressing and resolving the incident investigation teams findings and recommendations is required.  Contractors are defined for the purpose of this RMP as \"Anyone performing maintenance, repairs, turnarounds, major renovations or specialty work on or adjacent to the chlorine dioxide process\". All contractors that work on any part of the covered chlorine dioxide process will have to provide evidence that their employees understand their responsibility and are trained in correct operating and maintenance procedures as well as the specific safety requirements of working with chlorine dioxide.  This plan has been developed with the help of our employees. Details are covered in the PSM documentation.",

              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM -- CHLORINE,WATER TREATMENT  Stone Container Corporation, Panama City has a OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place covering its chlorine  operations. This PSM program meets the requirements of the RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the Panama City facility's RMP. The PSM program was audited in July 2005 and the program was found to be effective and being practiced. There were several items that needed some correction such as documentation of maintenance training. This has been addressed.  A process hazard analysis for the chlorine system was conducted and all items that were identified as a concern have been addressed.  The mill maintains current copies of the MSDS for all operating and maintenance employees to use in determining the required safety action they need to take in working with chlorine. These MSDS's are posted on the mill computer network and in written form in a central location.  There are up-to-date operating procedures that relate to the chlorine system. These procedures address the hazards of chlorine and how to safely complete the required task. Specific subjects that are addressed are:     Initial startup,     Normal operations,     Temporary operations,     Emergency shutdown and operations,     Startup after an emergency shutdown,     Normal shutdown,     Startup after a normal shutdown,     Startup after a change to the system that required a hazard review,     Consequence of a deviation and steps to correct or avoid the deviation,     Equipment inspections  All employees that work with or maintain the chlorine process and equipment have been trained in the correct procedures for their area of activity. Refresher training is conducted as often as necessary to insure employees are operating or maintaining the system according to current procedures and are adhering to the current procedures. The refresher training will include safety and the hazards of chlorine and avoidance of unsafe conditions.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years.  Written procedures are maintained for insuring the ongoing maintenance, inspections and checking of the integrity of the chlorine system equipment. There is a training program for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of the chlorine system equipment to insure that each employee can do the job in a safe manner. P.M. inspections are conducted using the Panama City's maintenance department's programs, forms and procedures.  Any incident that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine will be investigated. All employees are required to report all chlorine related incidents and document the incident using the mill Form. This form as related to a release of chlorine and its use will be a part of the safety training each employee involved in operation and maintenance of the chlorine  system will receive.  An incident investigation team approach is used to investigate any reported release.The facility procedures establish that prompt addressing and resolving the incident investigation teams findings and recommendations is required.  Contractors are defined for the purpose of this RMP as \"Anyone performing maintenance, repairs, turnarounds, major renovations or specialty work on or adjacent to the chlorine dioxide process\". All contractors that work on any part of the covered chlorine  process will have to provide evidence that their employees understand their responsibility and are trained in correct operating and maintenance procedures as well as the specific safety requirements of working with chlorine.  This plan has been developed with the help of our employees. Details are covered in the PSM documentation.",

The two systems are identical other than location. Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders. There are two cylinders connected at each location. Chlorine vapors pass through an in line electric heater, a regulator and vacuum shutoff valve, a flow meter, a flow control valve, a water driven vacuum inductor and is injected into the process water line.  \nChlorine Dioxide\nChlorine dioxide is generated on site in a process using sodium chlorate and methanol in a strong sulfuric acid solution. Chlorine dioxide is removed, as generated, by vacuum and absorbed in cold water (38-40 A?F) to a concentration of 9 to 10 grams / liter. There is a 244,000-gallon storage tanks for the chlorine dioxide solution. This solution is used at several locations in the bleach plant operations. The normal usage rate is approximately 550 gpm with a maximum capacity of the system at approximately 700 gpm.\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nChlorine Dioxide\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine dioxide that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 231,180 gallons of solution containing 19,248 pounds of chlorine dioxide. The tank is located in an area that serves to contain any non-EPA worst-case releases expected. This contained area has a maximum exposed surface area of 24,300 square feet. This will result in a worst-case release scenario quantity of 1069 pounds per minute of chlorine dioxide. For this worst-case calculation the total time of the release for all of the ClO2 to the atmosphere has been estimated to be about 18 minutes. There are administrative controls on chlorine dioxide inventory at the facility. The chlorine dioxide tank is 62 feet tall. There are operating instructions that restrict the operating level to only 58 feet. This allows room for holding the surge volume req"

This level is recorded on the log sheet and will serve as the record that this level is not exceeded. \n\nThere are passive control measures in place at the facility.\nThe first passive control is a curbed pad area where the ClO2 storage tank is located.  The volume of this contained area is 75,000 gallons. The surface area of this curbed area is 24,300 square feet. This will not contain an EPA defined worst-case release; however, it will contain the volume of any expected release scenarios.\n  \nThe second passive control is the drain from the contained area. This drain rated at 10,000 gpm will carry the released chlorine dioxide solution into a pond (emergency clarifier) to be mixed with other process sewer water. This could result in as much as 800 of the 1069 pounds per minute release reacting and not being released to the atmosphere. However, for the selected worst-case release rate it was assumed that all the ClO2 in solution going into the pond would be released.\n\nChlorine - Water treatment\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be in the largest container at each water treatment process area will be 2,000 pounds. There will be two one ton cylinders connected and operating at each process. There is no known scenario that a failure of one cylinder will cause a failure in the other cylinders at the process. Under the restrictions of the worst-case scenario a one ton cylinder will fail and will release its entire content. The worst-case release scenario quantity will be 2,000 pounds at a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. \nThere are no administrative controls on chlorine inventory.\nThere are no passive control measures in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative release scenario\nChlorine dioxide \nThe chlorine dioxide solution pump to the bleach plant is in operation and pumping at a rate of 700 gallons per minute.

A strict monthly Safety and Housekeeping Calendar ensures all safety systems are maintained in the highest level of effectiveness and preparedness. As process and systems change, so does our methodology for protecting our employees. Our mill holds the safety of our employees on the same level as producing a quality product - number one. We are the trendsetters in both of these areas, not the followers. As a residual effect, our neighbors in the community and the surrounding area benefit. The less problems within the mill means less likelihood of problems for our neighbors. As we move into the next millennium, we will continue to look at our methods and to ask ourselves if we can achieve the same results in a safer and more efficient manner.\n\nThe following changes to the 112(r) Risk Management covered process have been made.\nThe Panama City mill on October 15, 2000 completed a major modification of its pulp bleaching process. During this modification of the process the following changes were made that affect the 112(r) Risk Management Program.\n?? The use of elemental chlorine, as a bleaching agent, was stopped. This change in the bleaching process has removed the 180,000-pound railcars from the mill.\n?? A new state-of-the-art chlorine dioxide generator was installed to replace the 25-year-old unit. This new chlorine dioxide generator is more efficient, safer, and has all the up-to-date controls and protective equipment.\n?? This changes the EPA defined worst-case release scenario from a release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine to a release of 19,250 pounds of chlorine dioxide.\n \nOn January 2, 2006, the plan was reviewed and resubmitted.
