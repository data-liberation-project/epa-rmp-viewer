GENERAL FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE INFORMATION\n\nThe City of Indianola Public Works Department provides potable water and sanitary \nsewer service to its customers through its water distribution system, sewer collection\nsystem and wastewater lagoon. The facility has two regulated processes which use \nchlorine gas and qualify for program 2 regulations for EPA?s Risk Management Plan. \nThe first process includes  the wastewater lagoon disinfection system which uses gaseous\nchlorine in 1-ton containers. The total quantity maintained at the facility is 6000 pounds. \nThe second process is the storage of 150 pound cylinders for use in the water supply\nsystem. These cylinders are stored in public works building No. 3. The maximum amount \nstored is 24 cylinders or 3600 pounds.\n\nII.    PROGRAM 2 ? PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe release and prevention program is based on Program 2 regulatory requirements.  Up-to-date safety information related to gaseous chlorine processes and equipment has been compiled and will be maintained by the City of Indianola Public Works Department.\n\nPrevention steps include a hazard review of the chlorine processes and procedures. This review is performed by applying a checklist based on The Chlorine Manual, Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 1, 6th Edition, January 1997. Operating and maintenance procedures and instructions have been reviewed and compiled and are maintained at the facility. These procedures provide clear instructions and steps for safely conducting activities associated with each covered process. All employees presently operating processes involving chlorine have been properly trained or tested competent in the operating procedures that pertain to their duties. Any employees newly assigned to these duties will be properly trained and tested prior to beginning those duties involving chlorine.\n\nCompliance audits will be performed at least every three years in accordance with 40 CFR part 68.58. These audits will be conducted to ensure that the "
