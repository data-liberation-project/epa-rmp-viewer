Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1 O'Neill Vintners & Distillers, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers operates a processing facility for wine and other alcoholic beverages in Parlier, CA. The facility has three ammonia refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\nProcess 1 - Main Processing\n\n(9) Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers\n\n(3) Plate Heat Exchangers\n\n\n\nProcess 2 - 900 Tank Farm\n\n(2) Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers\n\n\n\nProcess 5 - Remote 900\n\n(3) Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers\n\n(1) Plate Heat Exchanger\n\n\n\nNote: Process 3 (Trailer Package) was decommissioned in 2016 with the installation of Process 5. Process 5 was designed by Axiom Engineers and installed by Cold Storage Technologies.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room/area. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nMachinery Room (Main Processing)\n\n(2) Reciprocating compressors\n\n(4) Screw compressors\n\n(6) Oil separators\n\n(4) Shell and tube oil coolers\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Main suction accumulator\n\n(1) Thermosyphon vessel\n\n\n\nChiller Room\n\n(1) Surge drum\n\n(2) Plate heat exchangers\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(5) Accumulators\n\n(5) Shell & tube heat exchangers\n\n\n\nCondenser Area\n\n(3"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through heat exchanger. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nEach system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the O'Neill Vintners & Distillers facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.

Nevertheless, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved O'Neill Vintners & Distillers' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that O'Neill Vintners & Distillers' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for O'Neill Vintners & Distillers employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program O'Neill Vintners & Distillers will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public"
