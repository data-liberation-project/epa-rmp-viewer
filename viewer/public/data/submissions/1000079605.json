The facility is guided by an operational philosophy that \"safety shall not be compromised for economy\".  Syngenta is proud to be certified as an OSHA VPP STAR facility.

These are evident in several plant policies and procedures, including Plant Procedure A-1, which is the Statement of Policy.  This procedure states that \"safety is a primary concern and a core value\" and that \"it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization\".\n\n   \n\nMore relevant to the Risk Management Program is Plant Procedure C-8 which is entitled Process Safety Management Standard Compliance Procedure.  The purpose of this procedure is \"To establish measures (per Process safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.11 and Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and procedures are in place to lessen the consequence should a large release occur. \n\n\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n\n\n Syngenta has separated the facility into several processes.  Of these, the processes subject to RMP and the regulated substances handled by these processes are as follows:  \n\nHCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms - anhydrous ammonia; sulfur dioxide; hydrocyanic acid; chlorine; isopropylamine; ethylamine\n\nMMU - Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate\n\n\n\nNote that in completing Section 7.0 of the RMP, the description of the prevention programs for these units, Syngenta separated the HCN/ HPF and associated Tank Farms into two sub-processes.  This was done because the Process Hazard Analysis for each of these is done independently of the others.  Also note that the information provided for each of these process hazard analysis represents the entire unit and associated chemicals as opposed to describing only the regulated compounds. \n\n\n\n(c) The general accidental release pr"

These analyses are conducted on unit equipment as well as processes and procedures.\n\n  \n\nSyngenta also has comprehensive procedures for inspection and maintenance of equipment.  The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.  This comprehensive manual documents the system used to ensure that maintenance and inspections are conducted effectively and efficiently, and that closure is attained on recommendations resulting from these activities.  The PM/PDM incorporates inspection plans designed to \"enhance safety, environmental integrity, operational reliability, and protection for plant personnel and the surrounding community\".\n\n\n\nSyngenta also conducts extensive employee training.  Some of this training is done via a web-based computer aided training system, Intelex, which allows on demand training around the clock.  The Intelex Training module electronically records this training.\n\n \n\n (d) The five-year accident history;\n\n\n\nWithin the past 5 years (June 2014 to June 2019), Syngenta has had no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.                                                                                                         \n\n\n\n(e) The emergency response program;\n\n\n\nSyngenta is a very proactive participant of the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) committee as well as having close involvement and interaction with the Iberville Parish Emergency Preparedness agency (the local LEPC).

This data management tool is also utilized to document MOC, and HSE Audit systems.\n\n\n\nA new position of Technical Training Coordinator was added to the site in January of 2009 in order to enhance training systems, and is now being conducted by a contract training coordinator.  The site has a mature workforce so much effort is being placed on early development of new Technicians so that the plant maintains its current skill level into the future.  Development of new employee training curriculum and systems for auditing of existing SOPs are two of the current 2009 projects for this position. A new electronic work permit system has been developed to make permits easier to create, implement, and track to completion.\n\n"
