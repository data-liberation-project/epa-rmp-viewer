Louisville Works, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Louisville Works site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown\".  We operate one process using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The process produces vinyl fluoride.  The process uses fluorine based technology.  We share the site with a Chemours HCFC-22 manufacturing facility.  The site is fenced and entry is controlled by security personnel at all times.\n\n\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemicals on our site is the rupture of an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride railcar, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed.  According to EPA's RMPComp program for worst case scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Rupture of a railcar is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields.   \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nHydrogen fluoride -- A 2\" valve on a pipe fails in the open position releasing hydrogen fluoride.  The hydrogen fluoride is detected by sensors, which activate alarms that prompt operators to remotely isolate the leak and activate water sprays within 3 minutes.  The pooled hydrogen fluoride is assumed to continue to evaporate for an additional 9 minutes.  Using EPA's RMPComp program for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would have of"

This release, if ignited, would have an offsite impact on other industry and residential populations as determined by the use of EPA's RMPComp program.  Rupture of the sphere is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design and maintenance of the sphere.  Additionally, ignition sources in the area of the sphere are strictly controlled.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\n1,1 difluoroethane -- A leak in the feed vaporizer releases 1,1 difluoroethane into the reactor room where it mixes with air and ignites, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Using EPA's RMPComp program, this release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations.  \n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention programs in place are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. \n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps:\n\n\n\n- Maintain up to date technical standards\n\n- System designs meet or exceed industry standard\n\n- Processes are controlled by computer and include alarms and interlocks to maintain safe operation \n\n- Materials installed pass Quality Assurance inspection\n\n- Perform Process Hazard Analyses on new and installed systems\n\n- Changes to technology or facilities are reviewed and authorized prior to implementation\n\n- All new or modified processes are started up under test authorization\n\n- All new or modified processes have prestartup safety inspections performed\n\n- Critical process equipment is inspected regularly for mechanic"
