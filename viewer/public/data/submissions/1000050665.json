According to EPA's RMPComp program for worst case scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Rupture of a railcar is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields.   \r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\r\n\r\nHydrogen fluoride -- A 2 valve on a pipe fails in the open position releasing hydrogen fluoride.  The hydrogen fluoride is detected by sensors, which activate alarms that prompt operators to remotely isolate the leak and activate water sprays within 3 minutes.
