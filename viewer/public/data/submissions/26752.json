Facility Policy.\n\n      The owners, management, and employees of Trotter Fertilizer and Propane are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,Valley County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers and propane for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application as a vutrient for crop production. The maximum stored would be pounds in a storage tand and nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst -case release and the alternative release scenarios:\n\n      a.The worst-case release scenario would release of the total contents of the storage tank over a ten minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 3.3 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.\n\n      b. The alternative release scenario:a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shutdown valve/values intervenes or  remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantitiy released would be 78000  pounds . The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .30 mile.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n      The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, In,. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administra"

Emergency Responce Program. \n\n      The Facility has:\n      a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n      b.Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n       Safety improvements are an on-going process at this facility. periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n8. For further Information contact; John  Felton at (308) 728-7722"
