      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Marathon Holding LLC\n\nSite and Process Description\n\nThe Andersons Marathon Holding LLC is located at 2404 West Highway 30 in Denison, Iowa. The facility is in Crawford County. The site is on the north side of Highway 30, across from the intersection of Westcott Road and Highway 30. \n\nThe Andersons Marathon Holding LLC facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 53 people. The following operations are performed at this facility: grain receiving and storage; hammer milling; fermentation; distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE); separation; wet and dry distillers grain and solubles (WDGS / DDGS) drying; storage and shipping; and ethanol storage and shipping.\n\nThe plant receives corn by way of the on-site grain elevator. Grain is stored temporarily in the concrete silos and steel bins, prior to being fed to three hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area. Additives are incorporated into the process and the product is fermented, creating a beer mash. The product goes through a scrubbing process to removed residual volatile organics and then enters the distillation and condensation process. The beer is approximately 10% ethanol and 90% non-fermentable corn solids. The ethanol is separated from the beer at this stage and leaves as 190-proof ethanol, which is sent to a bulk storage tank. The 190-proof contains residual water, so it is filtered one more time, which produces 200-proof ethanol. Lastly, the 200-proof ethanol is mixed with a denaturant and stored in either of two tanks prior to transferring to the truck or rail loadout areas. Vapors from the process vessels and distillation are controlled through a thermal oxidizer.\n\nThe distillation process separates the ethanol from the beer, non-fermentable corn solids and water. The remaining water is then removed from the residual mash or whole stillage. The resulting product is called wet distillers grain (WDG's)."

      "SummaryText": "About half of the WDGS is dried to approximately 60% moisture content and is called Modified Distillers Grain. The MDG's are sold directly to customers as high-quality animal feed. The other half of WDG's are dried to approximately 11% moisture content and is called Dried Distillers Grain. The DDG's travel through the cooling tube before being stored in the DDG Building located on the south side of the facility. They can be stored for extended \nperiods of time and are shipped out by truck or rail.\n\nThe thermal oxidizer serves as the primary emission control device for the two dryers as well as various process vents. The thermal oxidizer is very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors.\n\nThe facility also has a water cooling tower for non-contact cooling water used in the fermentation process and a fire pump for emergency use.\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\nThe facility stores and utilizes one product containing chemicals that require participation in the Risk Management Plan. That material is natural gasoline, a flammable mixture, which is used as a denaturant. There are multiple chemical constituents within natural gasoline. Based on chemical analysis, four of those constituents, butane; pentane; isobutane, and iso-pentane are subject to the Risk Management Plan. By weight, butane makes up 15%, pentane makes up 20%, isobutane makes up 9.5%, and iso-pentane makes up 23% of the natural gasoline.\n\nNatural gasoline is stored in a 100,000 gallon steel tank located in the facility's tank farm. Secondary containment consisting of a diked structure containing an impermeable liner and gravel overlay surrounds the tank farm.\n\nSummary of Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release - Flammable Mixture, Natural Gasoline\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be a total loss of a full tank of natural gasoline resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The storage tank capacity is 100,000 gallons or 550,000 pounds of natural gasoli"

      "SummaryText": "ne. Of the 550,000 pounds of natural gasoline, 375,375 pounds are subject to the worst-case release evaluation for flammable mixtures of the Risk Management Plan. RMP Comp was used to determine the distance to 1 psi overpressure and 2020 US Census Bureau Data was used to determine public receptor information.\n\nAlternative Release - Flammable Mixture, Natural Gasoline\n\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline emergency is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Deliveries are made by rail-car and pumped into the natural gasoline storage tank. Rail-cars are designed to carry 30,000 gallons or 165,000 pounds of natural gasoline. RMP Comp was used to determine the distance to 1 psi overpressure and 2020 US Census Bureau Data was used to determine public receptor information.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nThe Denaturant storage tank has a floating roof and can hold up to 100,000 gallons. The tank fill limit is 85% to control the possibility of an overfill and spill in containment. Overfill can cause damage to tank and product on the ground. The lower limit is 10% to prevent issues with displacement of the floating roof. Each rail-car will contain enough product to fill 30% of the Denaturant storage tank. Before unloading a rail-car the Denaturant storage tank volume is checked by the control room to make sure there is enough room in the Denaturant storage tank for the entire load, the tank must be no more than 55% full to accept and unload a natural gasoline rail-car or trailer. The level indicators are inspected and tested monthly for accuracy.\n\nAll deliveries are made during business hours and are observed by the facility personnel. Specific procedures were developed for the unloading of Natural gasoline. If a release were to occur the delivery attendants could stop the flow within minutes. The loadout area, where deliveries occur, has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary contain"

The active mitigation systems in place include excess flow valves, back check valves and manual emergency shut off valves.  Excess flow valves are located on appropriate liquid valves used in transferring the natural gasoline. They close automatically if the volume of liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate. Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly. Back check valves are located on the unloading lines are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only. This prevents natural gasoline from flowing back to the transport tank from the storage tank. There are manual emergency shut off valves near the natural gasoline storage tank.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program. All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly. A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of flammable mixtures. All hose replacements are documented. Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\nManagement System\n(see \"Steps Taken to Address Hazards\")\n\nEquipment maintenance\n\nAll equipment maintenance is formally documented.

Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.\n\nContractors\n\nContractors that are hired by The Andersons, Inc. go through a documented Prequalification Process.

Facility management, employees and fire department personnel have jointly discussed the location of the natural gasoline storage tanks and response procedures on a regular basis. They know the location of all emergency shutoff valves and on-site response equipment. We believe that a strong relationship with first responders is our best defense.\n\nThe LEPC and state regulatory agencies receive a copy of our hazardous materials storage information, every February, in accordance with our community right to know obligations. A copy of the Emergency Action Plan is on file with the LEPC and the local fire department.\n\nThe facility has not had an accident associated with their RMP regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\nSecurity Plans\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) 49 CFR Part 172, requires all facilities that offer or transport hazardous materials to document a security plan and perform employee awareness training. A security assessment plan has been created to describe all security measures at this facility, identify any vulnerable areas and then document the measures taken to address those risks. The plan is intended to work in conjunction with the Emergency Action and Spill Control Plan to meet all required criteria.\n\nTraining is performed with all employees annually and within 90 days of employment."
