This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Buckeye Development and Logistics, LLC (Buckeye) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Propane Terminal receives propane via a pipeline system, rail car or tank truck.  The propane is stored on site in preparation for tank truck and rail car loading.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the Tuscola Propane Terminal and is injected into the propane stream to odorize the propane during tank truck and rail car loading.  The Tuscola Propane Terminal is a fully automated facility and is available for around the clock loading and unloading by trained and qualified drivers.  The Tuscola Propane Terminal is equipped with multiple security systems so that only qualified drivers can gain access to the terminal and loading operations.  The Tuscola Propane Terminal is designed to fail safe.  In the process, the Terminal uses the following chemical that the EPA has identified in 40 CFR Part 68 as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  \n\n\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no listed toxic substances above threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\nThe following is a complete list of listed flammable substances at this facility.  \n\nSubstance        CAS No.\n\nPropane         74-98-6\n\n        \n\nBuckeye's accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts are designed to effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to employees, th"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating in process hazard analyses (PHAs).  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.  The Terminal Operations Manager is responsible for maintaining and implementing this RMP.\n\n \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of this process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the Facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The Facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly tra"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people (Compliance Group) who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and compliance expertise.  This Group identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, making suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe Group findings are forwarded to the Operations Manager for resolution.  All approved mitigation options in response to Group findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted approximately"

Once again, the Group \"Action Items\" are forwarded to the Operations Manager for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) normal startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a process modification or emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by Facility operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through Buckeye's management of change (MOC) process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Tuscola Terminal maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators and for other contracted personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Tuscola Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees and contractors involved in operating a process.  All receive basic training in facility operations (including process hazards, protective measures, and emergency actions) if they are not already familiar with such operations.  Facility operators also receive training in the provisions of the Facility PSM/RMP.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training and that they deem the frequency of training to be adequate.  \n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during daily operations, periods of increased maintenance, or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Tuscola Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor and document contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new process or process modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting task-specific training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nJob plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a MOC will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Tuscola Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nHAZARDOUS WORK PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to hel"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system as documented through Buckeye's Hazardous Work Authorization system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered process exclusive of those considered to be \"Replacement-in-Kind\".  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other Facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nThe Tuscola Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release (other than incidental), major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
