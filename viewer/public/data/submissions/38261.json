The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District provides water supply and distribution in El Dorado County.  Its water treatment facility, Reservoir7, is located off of Oak Hill Road and Pleasant Valley Road, Diamond Springs, CA in El Dorado County. This facility uses chlorine, a RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS, and additionally is used for warehousing in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS. The facility is located near Hanks Exchange.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site daily and also respond to alarm conditions.  \n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container"

      "SummaryText": " scales inside the building.  The chlorine is used to control biological growth on the filters and to disinfect the treated water.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector. \n\nChlorine is also received in 150# cylinders, for use at small chlorination facilities throughout the EID service area. These cylinders are delivered by the chemical supplier and placed in storage until EID personnel retrieve and transport up to six cylinders at a time via the EID 3/4 ton pickup truck for use at the remote sites.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of El Dorado Irrigation District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, El Dorado Irrigation District has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by El Dorado Irrigation District are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; "

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for El Dorado Irrigation District's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, improving the storage facility for 150-lb. cylinders.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEl Dorado Irrigation District's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with the El Dorado County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  El Dorado Irrigation District maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at its facilities using chlorine.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which El Dorado Irrigation District committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  It is planned to improve the storage area by moving cylinders to an area which is protected better from weather, and to install a leak detector.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
