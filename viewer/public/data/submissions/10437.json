The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment. The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals. The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe IMTT- Bayonne terminal requires an RMP because it stores several compounds in excess of the RMP threshold quantities as identified in the Federal Register, January 31, 1994. These include the following:\n\n       Butane - rail car unloading racks and operations in Yards 4 and 6\n\n       Propylene oxide/ methylene chloride blend  - tank 12638 along with associated loading and unloading systems and operations\n                                                                                                                                                                                   Ethylenediamine - tank 14370 along with associated loading and unloading systems and operations\n                                                                                                                                                                          \nWorst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenarios for these regulated substances include:\n\nFlammable regulated substances:\n\nScenario:\n\n    A railcar in either yard 4 or yard 6 containing butane ruptures, releasing the entire contents, 150,000 lb., of  butane. \n\n    100% of the butane is released into the air.\n\n    A vapor cloud explosion occurs. \n\nAdministrative Controls:\n\n    ISO 9000 operating procedures\n\n    Operators present during all unloading operations.\n\nMitigation Measures:\n\n    Unloading systems are designed to API Practice 251"

Hazard analyses have been carried out for the regulated processes. \n\nOperating procedures including ISO 9000 procedures and work instructions are followed in all loading and unloading operations. IMTT- Bayonne operators are trained to these procedures and receive additional safety training.\n\nIMTT- Bayonne maintains an extensive maintenance facility and provides continued inspection and maintenance of tanks, loading and unloading systems at the terminal.\n\nIncidents are tracked through an incident investigation program with prompt followup.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving any of the regulated substances per the definition in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIMTT- Bayonne maintains both a Spill Prevention Controls and Countermeasures Plan and an Emergency Response Action Plan. These plans are supported by a fire brigade and an emergency response team. These groups maintain a large inventory of fire fighting apparatus and emergency response equipment and materials.\n\nThere is an annual emergency response drill coordinated with local emergency planning and  response agencies."
