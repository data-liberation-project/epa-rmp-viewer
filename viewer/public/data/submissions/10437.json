The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment. The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals. The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe IMTT- Bayonne terminal requires an RMP because it stores several compounds in excess of the RMP threshold quantities as identified in the Federal Register, January 31, 1994. These include the following:\n\n   \tButane - rail car unloading racks and operations in Yards 4 and 6\n\n   \tPropylene oxide/ methylene chloride blend  - tank 12638 along with associated loading and unloading systems and operations\n                                                                                                                                                                               \tEthylenediamine - tank 14370 along with associated loading and unloading systems and operations\n                                                                                                                                                                          \nWorst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenarios for these regulated substances include:\n\nFlammable regulated substances:\n\nScenario:\n\n\tA railcar in either yard 4 or yard 6 containing butane ruptures, releasing the entire contents, 150,000 lb., of  butane. \n\n\t100% of the butane is released into the air.\n\n\tA vapor cloud explosion occurs. \n\nAdministrative Controls:\n\n\tISO 9000 operating procedures\n\n\tOperators present during all unloading operations.\n\nMitigation Measures:\n\n\tUnloading systems are designed to API Practice 251"

Design features include excess flow valves and automatic shutoff valves.\n\n\tFire water monitors surround the unloading systems.\n\nToxic Regulated Substances:\n\nRelease Scenario:\n\n\tThe tank containing ethylenediamine ruptures releasing the entire contents of the tank into a diked area.The contents are released into a diked impoundment.\n\n\tThe liquid pool evaporates, releasing the hazardous material into the atmosphere.\n\n\tAdministrative Controls:\n\n\tISO 9000 operating procedures.\n\n\tOperators present during all unloading operations.\n\nMitigation Measures:\n\n\tTank is located in a diked area.\n\n\tFire suppression foam injection into tank along with fire water lines. \n\n\tLine isolation valves \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nFlammable Regulated Substances\n\nRelease Scenario:\n\n\tA line ruptures during the railcar unloading resulting in a 10 minute release of butane. \n\n\t100% of the released material vaporizes.\n\n\tA vapor cloud explosion occurs.\n\nAdministrative Controls:\n\n\tISO 9000 operating procedures\n\n\tOperators present during all unloading operations.\n\nMitigation measures:\n\n\tUnloading systems are designed to API Practice 2510. Design features include excess flow valves and automatic shutoff valves safety switches and interlocks, safety relief valves.\n\n\tFire water monitors surround the unloading systems.\n\nToxic Regulated Substances:\n\n\tA line rupture during the ethylenediamineor propylene oxide/methylene chloride tank unloading  occurs into a contained area.\n\n\tThere is a 5 minute release of liquid into the dike. The liquid pool evaporates, releasing the hazardous material into the atmosphere\n\nAdministrative Controls:\n\n\tISO 9000 operating procedures.\n\n\tOperators present during all unloading operations.\n\nMitigation Measures:\n\n\tUnloading equipment is located in an area contained by drains.\n\n\tFire suppression foam monitor system along with fire water lines. \n\n\tLine isolation valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIMTT maintains a comprehensive accidental release prevention prog"

      "SummaryText": "ram. For all materials handled on site along with the regulated substances, safety information is maintained regarding the materials, tanks and associated equipment. Hazard analyses have been carried out for the regulated processes. \n\nOperating procedures including ISO 9000 procedures and work instructions are followed in all loading and unloading operations. IMTT- Bayonne operators are trained to these procedures and receive additional safety training.\n\nIMTT- Bayonne maintains an extensive maintenance facility and provides continued inspection and maintenance of tanks, loading and unloading systems at the terminal.\n\nIncidents are tracked through an incident investigation program with prompt followup.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving any of the regulated substances per the definition in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIMTT- Bayonne maintains both a Spill Prevention Controls and Countermeasures Plan and an Emergency Response Action Plan. These plans are supported by a fire brigade and an emergency response team. These groups maintain a large inventory of fire fighting apparatus and emergency response equipment and materials.\n\nThere is an annual emergency response drill coordinated with local emergency planning and  response agencies."
