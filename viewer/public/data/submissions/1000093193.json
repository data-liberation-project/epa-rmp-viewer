      "SummaryText": "case release scenario is the same for the both covered processes because the largest vessel (i.e. a 10,725-gallon Cargo Tank) is common to both covered processes when connected, and the MPR is not capable of storing anhydrous ammonia.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all the content in the largest vessel (i.e. Cargo Tank) is released.   The release scenario consists of the cargo Tank being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are the same for the two covered processes.  The alternative scenario is a 30-second release from a violent rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact or pull-away during a transfer operation.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the Cargo Tank; emergency shutoff valves on the mobile pipe reactor; and backpressure check valve and excess flow valves on the PV side of the transfer hose connection), and operating procedures that the Contractors use to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Accident Prevention Program elements.  The Operations Manager is responsible for managing the Contractors in accordance with the Facility PSM/RMP Contractor management program.  The Contractors are responsible for training their personnel.  The Cargo Tank Owner/Operator is responsible for maintaining its equipment in accordance with the DOT regulations, and the IFRC Contractor is responsible for the implementation of its OSHA PSM.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is a non-responding Facili"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this to reflect a change in the Emergency Contact and RMP Implementation Manager.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\r\n\r\no\tCovered Process 1: Cargo Tank Staging (Anhydrous Ammonia)\r\no\tCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a Contractor owned and operated Cargo Tank.  The Cargo Tank Operator stages the Cargo Tank at the Facility and remains present to open and close valves, and to implement emergency shutdown procedures if required.  The Cargo Tank is connected to the Mobile Pipe Reactor by transfer hoses.\r\n\r\nThe Facility hires a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor - IFRC) to transfer and blend anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid and water to make ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer.  The APP liquid fertilizer is blended in a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by the Contractor.  The APP liquid fertilizer is not subject to the PSM/RMP rules.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes.
