The plant serves the cities of West Linn, Oregon City, and Gladstone.  The plant, which was built in 1986, is owned and operated by the Clackamas County Water Environment Services Department. Wastewater flows vary from 6 million gallons per day (mgd) in the dry season to 25 mgd in the wet season.  The plant is operated in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) permit issued by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\r\n\r\nPeracetic Acid\r\nWater Environment Services is considering the use of peracetic acid as a replacement disinfectant for the chlorine system at Tri-City WPCP.  Peracetic acid is a strong disinfectant with a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Due to its bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, and sporicidal effectiveness, the use of peracetic acid as a disinfectant for wastewater effluents has been drawing more attention in recent years. Positive aspects of peracetic acid use for wastewater disinfection are the ease of implementing treatment (without the need for expensive capital investment), the broad spectrum of activity even in the presence of heterogeneous organic matter, the absence of persistent toxic or mutagenic residuals or by-products, no quenching requirement (i.e., no dechlorination), small dependence on pH, short contact time, and effectiveness for primary and secondary effluents.\r\n\r\nA large consideration in replacement of the chlorine system with a peracetic acid disinfection system is the reduction of risk to the surrounding community by removal of the RMP covered process.  Peracetic acid is also a listed chemical under the RMP rules but a new disinfection system at Tri-City WPCP would require an amount of acid below the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for RMP.

Risk to the surrounding community would be reduced by replacement of the chlorine disinfection system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tri-City plant currently uses the following process to treat wastewater: \r\n\r\n-First screens are used to separate the water from large debris, such as limbs and rags. \r\n\r\n-In grit chambers, air is added to the water to make it lighter so dirt and other heavier particles settle to the bottom.\r\n\r\n-Next, in the primary clarifiers, additional solids are allowed to settle out of the raw wastewater.\r\n\r\n-The main part of wastewater treatment occurs in aeration basins where oxygen is added to the water, creating an environment where beneficial bacteria can grow and reproduce. These bacteria digest unwanted bacteria and organic matter in the raw wastewater. \r\n\r\n-In the secondary clarifiers, the last of the solids are separated from the water as they settle to the bottom. Now, the water and solids go in different directions. \r\n\r\n-The water flows into the chlorine contact chamber where chlorine is added to kill any remaining bacteria. Chlorine is the primary wastewater disinfectant used around the world to reduce pathogens in wastewater and the related risks to public health. It is inexpensive, effective, readily available, and its chemistry is well understood. Chlorine is used because it is a very effective disinfectant that is highly toxic to organisms in the wastewater.  It is this toxicity that creates a risk to people and the environment if the chlorine gas used to disinfect wastewater at the Tri-City plant is accidentally released. Chlorine is the regulated chemical discussed in this risk management plan. To reduce the risk of such a release, the Tri-City Plant uses a number of safety precautions, which are discussed below.\r\n\r\n-The water is then dechlorinated and tested to make sure it meets wastewater discharge standards before it is disch"

These are allowed to decompose in anaerobic sludge digesters.  This process produces digester gas, composed primarily of methane, which is used as a fuel to heat the digesters and to generate electricity to offset the plant's power needs.  Digester gas is the second regulated chemical discussed in our risk management plan. Once the solids have decomposed they are land applied.\r\n\r\nTRI-CITY'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \r\nAND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nPublic health and safety issues are the greatest concern for the Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant because we are responsible for treating wastewater and protecting the quality of the Willamette River.   Plant staff and management are also committed to minimizing the related possible risks presented by those processes used to treat the Tri-City area's wastewater.  \r\n\r\nOne chemical regulated by EPA's risk management program, chlorine, is stored onsite.  The plant also complies with OSHA's process safety management (PSM) rules, which also regulate this chemical.\r\n\r\nThe plant has an integrated risk management program, which consists of staff training, a plant safety program, regular maintenance checks and upgrades, daily plant inspection, and an accidental release prevention program.  The plant's process safety program is audited at least every 5 years. \r\n\r\nStaff Training\r\n\r\nOperators are trained in formal certification classes, on-the-job demonstrations, and monthly safety meetings.  Each employee receives training in plant  processes and chlorine handling and operating procedures upon hire, and appropriate training before being involved in any newly assigned process.

Plant Staff trained in chlorine handling procedures use a specially designed crane system to transfer the 1-ton chlorine tanks from the truck to the chlorine building. Each tank is about 6.5 feet long and 30 inches in diameter, about the size of a large water heater.  The chlorine is stored in a leak tight, concrete chlorine building.  \r\n\r\nThis building is equipped with a chlorine detection alarm system.  If a release occurs and the chlorine concentration inside the building is less than 10 parts per million (ppm), red lamps over the building doors flash on and off, a \"warning\" light on the control panel turns on,  an alarm horn begins to sound intermittently, and all staff evacuate the building. Trained staff in appropriate safety gear may then reenter the building to find and repair the leak. The alarm system automatically resets itself once chlorine gas is not detected in the building.\r\n\r\nIf a release occurs and concentrations inside the building are greater than 10 ppm, the red lamps over the building doors remain on, an \"alarm\" light on the control panel turns on, the alarm horn sounds constantly, the omni-directional fire siren sounds constantly  and a \"chlorine leak alarm\" is automatically sent to offsite emergency response personnel.

A high-efficiency mist eliminator then removes residual caustic solution, which is collected in a storage tank.  The scrubber is designed to provide a minimum overall performance of 99.99 percent chlorine removal.  To ensure that the scrubber continues to operate throughout any release, it can only be shut down manually by turning off the system at the control panel. \r\n\r\nAnother area where the risk of an accidental release can be reduced is in the chlorine distribution system.  The Tri-City plant uses a vacuum chlorine gas feed system.  In this system, flowing wastewater creates a vacuum that pulls the chlorine out of the storage cylinder and through the delivery piping. The unit will not allow chlorine to flow unless a vacuum is present. If a problem occurs, such as the vacuum line breaking or the ejector failing, the flow of chlorine is automatically halted. \r\n  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Tri-City Water Pollution Control Plant has developed an emergency response plan to meet OSHA requirements (1910.38).  This plan applies to both chlorine and digester gas incidents.  The plant also has an additional emergency action plan to address small chlorine releases.   \r\n\r\nFor minor leaks (10 ppm or less, usually encountered during the cylinder change procedure), employees, who wear respirators during this procedure, close the main cylinder valve and follow a checklist procedure to reseat or tighten the yoke connections and valves.  \r\n\r\nAny major release (more than 10 ppm) automatically causes the scrubber to activate and offsite response personnel to be alerted.  Operators immediately evacuate the chlorine room and implement the Emergency Action Plan.
