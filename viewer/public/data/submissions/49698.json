Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPiedmont Laboratories is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our Prevention Program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release.   The program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators. \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPiedmont Laboratories is a manufacturing plant that uses hydrocarbon propellant to pressurize aerosol cans.  This plant uses a mixture of several regulated substances as a propellant.   These substances are composed of a combination of propane, isobutene, N-butane, 1-1 difloroethane, isopentane, and Dimethyl Ether (DME).  For simplicity the worst case analysis and alternate release scenario were based on the major component of the mixture with the highest heat of combustion.  In the case of the propellants, propane and its properties were used in the analysis.  The maximum quantity of these regulated mixtures at this facility is 745,712 pounds. \n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorst Case Scenario \u00bf Failure of the storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 745,712 pounds of propane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of these tanks to 85%.   It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, 10% of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 PSI for the worst-case scenario is 0.77 miles. \n\nAlternative Case Scenario \u00bf The alternative case scenario analyzed a pull-away rupture causing failure of a 30 foot length of 4- inch diameter transfer hose.  The release of propellant is limited to the qu"

      "SummaryText": "antity in the hose due to the proper functioning of excess flow valves that prevented further release.  The contents of the hose are released and travel to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to this end point is less than 320 feet, but has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPiedmont Laboratories believes the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  The facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards.  By following set operational procedures and scheduled maintenance practices, the equipment within the facility should continue to operate in a safe and effective manner.  In addition the Release Prevention Program is constantly being improved through employee training and regular compliance audits.  An example of this is the recent instillation of a proppellant recovery system. \n\n5.  Five-year accident history\nPiedmont Laboratories has not experienced any accidents within the last five years that either led to the release of hazardous chemicals or has had the potential to lead to such a release. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nA well planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential impact of an accidental release.  Quick actions can minimize the damage to both humans and the natural surroundings.  Piedmont Laboratories has coordinated emergency response efforts with appropriate local agencies and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA proactive maintenance program will be implemented to ensure the integrity of the equipment."
