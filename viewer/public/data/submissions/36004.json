THE FACILITY POLICY:  The Owners, Management, and Employees of Gibbs Fertilizer Corporation are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local Fire Department and the local Emergency Planning Committee so they can plan for response to any release to people and to the envirnment.    2.  FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage, blending, and application of fertilizers for farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient and also used for blending in a mixing operation to make mixed grade fertilizers for application.  The maximum quantity stored would be 306,000 pounds in the facility's three tanks.  The capacity of these tanks are 30,000 gallons, 30,000 gallons, and 12,000 gallons.  3.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 196,000 pounds, which represents on 30,000 gallon and the 12,000 gallon tank that are connected and filled to 85 percent of capicity.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.33 miles.   4.  The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a one inch transfer hose, with a 12,000 released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.56 miles.  5.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The Facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handing of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, equipment, containers and Storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistant with ANSI K661.1 and OSHA 29 CRF 1910.111 regarding stor"

THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CRF 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emerency response action plan has been reviewed with the local Fire Department and provided to the local Emergency Planning Committee for coordination in the community response planning.  8.00  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safety practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
