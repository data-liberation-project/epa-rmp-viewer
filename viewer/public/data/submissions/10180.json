This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n This program level 1 GPM gas processing plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate) from raw natural gas. This plant has two regulated flammables:  Propane and NFPA 4 flammable mixtures.  \n \n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in this program level 1 gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a NFPA 4 flammable mixture (product surge tank).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n \n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Although the processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation, they are not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  However, this summary describes several management system elements in place to improve the accident prevention program.\n \n Employee Participation\n \n This program level 1 GPM gas plant encourages"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n \n \n Contractors\n \n This program level 1 GPM gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, this program level 1 GPM gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n \n This program level 1 GPM gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process.
