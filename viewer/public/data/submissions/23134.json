      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Vinings Industries, Inc.\nPlant: Marietta, GA\n\nVinings Industries is a chemical manufacturing company based in Atlanta, GA.  We produce products for several diverse industries including paper manufacturing, pigment mining, textile sizing, paint manufacturing, water treatment and agricultural pest control. \n\nThe Marietta plant manufactures products for the paper, paint, pigment mining and textile sizing markets.  The portion of the plant that is covered by Risk Management makes acrylic polymers that are sold to companies in the above markets. The polymer production facility has been in operation for 24 years, utilizing state of the art process control instrumentation as well as emissions control units including a thermal-oxidation unit and an onsite wastewater pretreatment plant.\n\nOSHA regulations (Process Safety Management) for several years have required that multiple Layers of Protection be included during design, before startup and to continue through operations and training of all employees. These Layers of Protection are maintained today as part of our Risk Management Programs.\n\nThe polymer plant uses two raw materials that are covered under Risk Management:  vinyl acetate and ammonia solution . EPA lists both of these materials as Toxics. \n\nVinyl acetate:\n    Colorless liquid with a sharp sweet odor \n    Flammable in liquid and vapor form\n    Liquid vinyl acetate is lighter than water\n    Vinyl acetate vapor is lighter than air \n    Direct contact to skin and eyes will cause irritation\n    Inhalation of fumes can cause shortness of breath and sore throat\n\nAmmonium hydroxide solution:\n    Colorless liquid with a pungent, ammonia odor \n    Liquid ammonium hydroxide is lighter than water\n    Ammonia vapor is lighter than air\n    Contact with the eyes can result in severe irritation or blindness\n    Contact with the skin can cause burns or blistering\n    Inhalation of high concentrations can cause respiratory distress\n        \nAs part of Vinings' stewardship and safety programs, we reco"

Materials handling, from unloading through process vessels are in closed vent systems or when venting is required, is routed through scrubbers designed to minimize emissions to the atmosphere. \n\nWe receive tank truck shipments of refrigerated ammonium hydroxide solution. Our storage tank is insulated and temperature controlled.\n\nThe polymer reaction systems (as well as loading and unloading systems) are monitored by computers and by trained operators. Interlocks in the computer logic, for example, are designed to prevent a storage tank from being overfilled. Operator double-checks are in place to assure all valves are in the proper position and that all safety observations and checks are properly completed.\n\nAll material transfers are through closed pipe systems. Vapor return lines are used in most unloading procedures to return the displaced vapor to the delivery vehicle. Additionally, all reaction vessels use a series scrubber unit complete with a hydrocarbon analyzer to measure the VOC output on a continuous basis. Vent lines to the monomer storage tanks and monomer feed tanks are hard piped to the scrubber, after which residual vapors pass through the thermal-oxidation unit. \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis: \nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical - Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario to be the sudden and complete loss of a full tank (76,619 pounds) of vinyl acetate. The only safety precautions that Risk Management allows to be considered in the Worst Case Scenario are passive mitigation. In our case, the storage tank is surrounded by concrete dike containment. The contents of the ruptured tank would empty into the secondary containment, limiting the surface area from which vinyl acetate could evaporate. Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate evaporated vinyl acetate would travel approximately "

Within the affected area, a population of 340 would potentially be affected, including  industrial facilities and a National Park\n\nAlternative Scenarios:  While the alternative scenarios are still unlikely to occur, they are more likely to happen than are Worst Case Scenarios. In the Alternative Scenarios, we can presume our Layers of Protection, our safety processes, our safety programs, our safety equipment and our people will be available for response.  While these scenarios are more likely to happen than the Worse Case, and these are the scenarios that we use for Emergency Planning, our safety systems are designed to prevent them from happening.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario - Toxic #1 - Analysis of our systems indicate that a more likely toxic scenario would be a liquid release from a open 3/4\" vent or drain valve on the tank or in the transfer or unloading piping.  It is also assumed that this release occurs outside of the diked area (This would be the case if a the leak location were in the transfer piping which is outside the dike walls.)  Mitigation systems include concrete containment pads which slope to trench drains and sumps under the pipe racks,  A sprinkler systems, a deluge system, water curtain, foam suppression as emergency shutdown systems. These mitigation systems are not used in calculating the endpoint because of the short time duration of the event. In such case, we estimate the loss to be 5,120 pounds in 20 minutes. Using EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate vinyl acetate would travel 0.22 miles before the concentration dispersed to a level considered by EPA to be non-hazardous. Within these areas, a population of 320 would potentially be affected, including commercial and industrial facilities, and a National Park.

Note that while the tank or pipe may not have specific containment, the entire production area is equipped with floor drains to prevent free liquid from leaving the site. In such an incident, the loss of ammonia would be 3,700 pounds in 10 minutes. Using EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate ammonia would travel 0.1 miles before the concentration dispersed to a level considered by EPA to be non-hazardous. Within these areas, a population of 37 would potentially be affected, including commercial and industrial facilities.\n\nScenarios - Flammables - We have materials at the Marietta facility that are flammable (including vinyl acetate which is considered by EPA to be Toxic and is discussed above). These other flammable materials, however, are not regulated under RMP. Regardless, we have systems in place for these flammable materials, including vinyl acetate, that are designed to prevent accidents and to respond to accidents if they occur. \n\nThe polymer plant at Marietta is designed to prevent releases and to minimize hazards from flammable materials. Where flammable materials are stored or processed, inert (gas) padding systems are employed to minimize the potential for fires or explosions. In addition, vessels and piping are grounded to minimize static or electrical ignition such as from lightning strikes.\n\nIn the event of a fire on the plant site, our emergency response teams are trained to evaluate the magnitude of the fire and if it is within their capability, to fight it until outside assistance arrives. Our fire fighting systems include a four team incipient Fire Brigade with a plant-wide response time of less than three minutes, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Capabilities include water supply from two different headers coming into the plant and two auxiliary pumping systems; both with internal emergency power.\n\nAccident history: In the past five years, this "

However, on January 29,1996, an operator inadvertently mixed two materials improperly and released sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere. Nearby businesses and residences were evacuated and seven people sought medical attention. We have since instituted processes and procedures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nIn addition, we have experienced occasions when citizens have reported objectionable odors coming from the Marietta plant. There have been no reported offsite consequences. Regardless, we have an obligation to determine the source(s) of these odors and to take actions to prevent a recurrence. In each instance of an odor complaint, we have investigated the cause and as applicable, corrected the problem and/or taken actions to prevent a recurrence. An example of corrective actions designed primarily for odor control was the installation of the thermal oxidation unit in 1995 at a cost of $350,000.\n\nThe goal at Vinings is to produce quality products and to produce them safely. We have systems in place that are designed to prevent accidents, to safeguard our employees, our community and our environment. Following is a partial listing of the Layers of Protection that we employ in our everyday activities.\n\nDesign: Since the inception of OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, we used best engineering practices to assure the systems would operate as intended. All changes or additions to the processes undergo a formal review and approval procedure. This triggers hazard analysis and design safety reviews as necessary. We have concrete dikes to catch any spilled materials. \n\nAll of our valve systems are designed to fail-safe.

If we find a valve, pipe, tank or pump that might fail and allow a release or an incident, we will correct it immediately.  \n\nMaintenance: We have formal mechanical integrity program and preventative maintenance program in place. Tanks and piping undergo thickness testing for assessing life and to determine needs for repair or replacement before failure. Our operators will recheck equipment before operating it, after maintenance has been performed on it. Using a combination of safety and quality programs, all of our instruments are calibrated and our storage and transfer systems are tested on a regular basis.\n\nSafe Operations: Our employees are essential to the safe operation of our plant. Their training, their experience, their observations and their knowledge of how to respond to situations is the basis of safe operations. These people apply their knowledge and training in their everyday actions. All activities in the polymer plant - from unloading railcars to filling trucks with finished products - are restricted to trained, designated employees.\n\nActivities in polymer plant are computer aided. This means that some actions taken by an operator are checked against an internal list in the computer's memory as well as with remote sensors to make sure it is the correct action. On plant operations designated as having high risk potential, we have systems designed to automatically manage emergency interlocks that will shut down selected transfers to some vessels, shut down pumps or automatically cool vessels. \n\nThe equipment and systems that contain these materials are closed; that is, the materials are contained in equipment that is designed to prevent materials from reaching the atmosphere or environment.
