      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Praxair facility at Bagdad, Pennsylvania is a hydrogen production plant. We react steam and methane (natural gas) to form hydrogen gas, which we then purify and distribute through a pipeline to an on-site steel plant.\nIn addition to the hydrogen we produce on-site, we also have two cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage vessels that are connected to the pipeline, which supplement the hydrogen supply to customer.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \nHydrogen -  manufactured and stored on site for pipeline supply to customer. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council?s program of Responsible Care? Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard and EPA?s Risk Management Program rule, the Bagdad, PA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\nAt this location we have field mounted fire sensors with audible and visual alarm indication and call put capabilities that interact with the Customer first response team.  Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant.  They are maintained monthly by on-site Personal and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor. PET (Plant emergency trips) are located at the control building and front gate. Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process. Plant alarm conditions will call out to Barberton process plant, who can monitor the process and take any necessary corrective actions. \n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Bagdad, PA  facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last fi"

There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Bagdad, PA location will be a ?non-responding facility? as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan with Allegheny Ludlum (West Leechburg Works) who is considered our first responder.  This plan is also coordinated with the Adams Township Municipal Fire Department.  \n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of ?Zero/Zero?, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvements that have reached the planning stage."
