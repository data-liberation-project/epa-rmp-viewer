In our emergency planning we have considered two scenarios for each chemical,  these involve a worst case release scenario and a more likely but still uncommon alternate scenario.  The worst case scenarios involve the release of the entire contents of the largest tank of  anhydrous ammonia or liquid propane tank.  The alternative scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a nurse tank hose rupturing.  The alternative scenario for liquid propane gas involves a transfer hose rupturing.  This planning was aided by RMPComp, a program designed by the EPA that provides conservative results. The population within a radius supplied by each scenario could be effected in the remote chance of a release occuring.      (d) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.      The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Huron, SD facility's anhydrous accidental release prevention program complies with the Environmental Protection Agency accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
