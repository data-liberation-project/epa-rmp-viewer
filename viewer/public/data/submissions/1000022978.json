The ammonia refrigeration system contains 34,602 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy.\nCommercial Warehousing policy demands a proactive approach to equipment maintenance. Equipment failure is the primary hazard facing a refrigerated storage facility. Frequent monitoring of equipment reduces the chances of an accidental release. Commercial Warehousing uses a rigorous inspection program to ensure that equipment is functioning properly and pays close attention to routine equipment maintenance. Commercial Warehousing employs only 2-3 people to work on the refrigeration process. Much of the equipment maintenance is performed by licensed contracting companies.\n\nCommercial Warehousing refrigeration employees have received emergency response plan training. The Emergency Response (ER) Plan includes notification of potentially affected neighbors. Commercial Warehousing's inspection/maintenance program includes emergency equipment as well.\n\nWorst- Case Scenario and Alternate Scenario or Accidental Release-\nThe Worst-Case release scenario estimate involves a release from the North receiver (V1). An ammonia release of 7,404 pounds is estimated to potenially affect an area of 0.43 miles.\n\nA possibly more likely scenario involves a lifting safety relief valve from that requires 10 minutes to stop. This release was also modeled using EPA guidance. In this scenario approximately 920 lbs. of ammonia would be released and expected to travel approximately 0.06 miles from the source.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps-\nCommercial Warehousing adheres to 29 CFR1910.119 (OSHA's PSM regulation) and documents inspections and maintenance procedures. \n\nEmerg"

The local Police/Fire authorities will assist in notification of nearby citizenry in the event of a catastrophic release.\n\nCommercial Warehousing conducts monthly inspections of their Emergency Response equipment to ensure that all equipment is functioning properly.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\nCommercial Warheousing plans to install automatic ammonia leak monitors to improve their leak detection capabilities."
