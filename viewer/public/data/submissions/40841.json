The Prevention Program consists of a number of initiatives\nthat, working together, provide employees and off-site receptors\nwith the safest possible environment.\n\nEmployees are taught to respect the dangers inherent in working\nwith ammonia and how to react in case of a system upset.  Staff\nare intimately involved in the PSM Program.  Equipment is designed\nto minimize major releases; detailed, formal operating and\nmaintenance procedures guarantee system integrity to the extent\npossible.  Process modifications are evaluated for impact on\nsafety.\n\nClement-Pappas has, in conjunction with local emergency planners\nand responders, developed a plan of action designed to ensure the\nsafety of local residents should a release occur.  These agencies\nare also notified when major work on the refrigeration system is\nbeing done.\n\nPrevention efforts are reviewed periodically and revised as\nnecessary.",

Empolyees are major\nstakeholders in safe operations and are actively involved in\ndeveloping and implementing the PSM Program.  Periodic, timely\ntraining emphasizing concepts needed to ensure personal safety and\nproper reaction to emergency situations further demonstrates the\nCompany's commitment to safe operations.  In-plant monitoring of\nkey areas provides a safe work environment along with adequate\nwarning of any threat to employees' safety; changes in operation\nrequire evaluation of relevant safety issues.\n\nThe public is well served through the Company's close involvement\nwith local emergency response organizations.  Plant management\nworks with incident response personnel as needed.  Public\nnotification procedures have been developed.\n\nThe Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) has been completed for\npresent operating conditions for plant personnel information only.\n\nEmployee awareness might be the single most important factor in\nminimizing accidental releases to the atmosphere, and the Company\nstrives to keep awareness levels at the highest by mandating\nperiodic employee training.
