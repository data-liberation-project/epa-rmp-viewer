      "SummaryText": "CHAPTER 1\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n1.1    BACKGROUND\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, in order to prevent or minimize the consequence of a catastrophic release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. The regulation requires a written plan to effectively communicate the hazards posed by processes involving hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe PSM regulations apply to any chemicals held in larger quantities than the \"threshold\" quantities identified in the regulations. The Joint Regional Sewerage Board Wastewater Treatment Plant ( JRSB WWTP) currently uses only one chemical in larger than the threshold quantity: chlorine (threshold quantity 1,500 pounds). A Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan addressing certain issues is required under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM plan must include the following topics:\n\nA?    employee participation\nA?    process safety information\nA?    process hazard analysis\nA?    operating procedures\nA?    training\nA?    contractors\nA?    pre-startup safety review\nA?    mechanical integrity\nA?    hot work permits\nA?    management of change\nA?    incident investigation\nA?    emergency planning and response\nA?    compliance audits\n\nThe OSHA PSM plan is directed at protecting the health and safety of the employees working around the covered chemical process.  The different parts of the PSM plan do not consider the possible off-site consequences of a problem with a covered chemical process.  An additional program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) addresses the off-site consequences of problems at facilities with a covered chemical process. This additional program is called the Risk Management Program (RMP) and is described in 40 CFR 68.  The information required for the RMP program is nearly identical to the information in the PSM, with one exception.  The RMP includes sections regarding the off-site consequences of a chemical release at a facility."

      "SummaryText": " \n\nThe JRSB WWTP maintains this combined PSM/RMP plan to address the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the USEPA RMP program. \n\n1.2    APPLICABILITY\n\nAn obligation to comply with the PSM and the RMP regulations is incurred if a facility uses more than a threshold quantity of a covered chemical.  Each regulation contains a list of covered chemicals, and each chemical has a threshold quantity.  If a facility holds a listed chemical in a larger quantity than the threshold quantity, then the facility must have a PSM and RMP in place.  The list of chemicals covered, and threshold quantities, is very similar from the PSM to the RMP programs.   A significant difference between the programs involves the threshold quantity for chlorine.  \n\nPSM Threshold Quantity = 1,500 pounds (29 CFR 1910.119, Appendix A)\nRMP Threshold Quantity = 2,500 pounds (40 CFR 68.130, Table 1)\n\nThe JRSB WWTP uses chlorine in quantities much larger than either threshold quantity shown above, so both PSM and RMP regulations apply.  This document includes all of the information required to describe both the PSM and RMP programs at the JRSB WWTP. All information required for the OSHA PSM program is listed first, in Chapter 2; the additional information for the USEPA RMP program follows in Chapter 3.  Recordkeeping requirements for each program are shown in a separate section near the end of the report.\n\n1.3    SITE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe JRSB WWTP is located on Ecology Lane in West Haverstraw, New York.  The fenced facility uses chlorine to disinfect wastewater seasonally (May 15th through October 15th).  The chlorine is stored in steel cylinders, each holding either 2,000 pounds (1 ton) or 150 pounds (lbs.) of the liquefied gaseous chemical. The maximum inventory capacity at the site is nine 2,000-lb. cylinders in the Chlorine Building, but generally the JRSB WWTP keeps an operational inventory of no more than eight cylinders on site.  Ten 150-lb. cylinders are kept in the Sludge Treatment Building.  Th"
