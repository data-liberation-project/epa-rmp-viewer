The accident scenarios found in PHAs form the basis of additional\r\nanalyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to\r\nprotect both our employees and our neighbors. They also help us target the most important equipment for\r\nmore frequent inspection.\r\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble\r\nshooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas. Operators are involved in writing,\r\nreviewing, and updating operating procedures.\r\n- Training - Training is based on the operating instructions. Operators help determine the frequency of\r\nrefresher training.\r\n- Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that\r\nensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals. This system is being\r\ncontinuously improved.\r\n- Management of change - As an industry pioneer in the management of change, we have a comprehensive,\r\nwell-institutionalized MOC system. Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system\r\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified\r\nprocess is built as intended. It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are,\r\nindeed applicable to the process as built. PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\r\n- Compliance audits - Several types of compliance and management system audits are performed. RMP/PSM\r\nself-audits are performed every three years. Actions needed are entered into a computer-based action\r\ntracking system that automatically tells those responsible if completion of action items is taking longer than\r\nanticipated, so that remedial steps may be taken. In addition, annual self-assessments are performed on\r\ndifferent elements of process safety.\r\n- Incident investigation - We also pioneered process safety"

This information is categorized as follows:\r\n- Registration\r\n- Offsite consequence analysis\r\n- Five-year accident history\r\n- Program 3 prevention program\r\n- Emergency response program\r\n\r\nRevision History\r\n7/7/2016\r\n\r\nResubmission:\r\nAdding Hurricane Preparedness to 'Executive Summary' and update to Prevention Program information.\r\n\r\n3/21/2015\r\nResubmission:\r\n-Update 1: Section 1.17.c Quantity on-site has been updated from 165,000 lbs of vinyl acetate to 745,000 lbs and 180,000 lbs of acrylonitrile to 380,000 lbs. The updated quantities for both chemicals is due to the potential to store rail cars on-site. The updates reflect a maximum potential inventory.\r\n-Update 2: Section 2 Toxics Worst Case - The worst case release scenario is based upon failure of a rail car which is used to store acrylonitrile. The inventory in a rail car was increased from 180,000 lbs to 200,000 lbs because rail cars have the potential to hold 200,000 lbs as opposed to 180,000 lbs which is on the Bill of Lading. This estimate was updated to be more conservative. The release scenario was also updated to remove passive mitigation considered as a more conservative approach. Further, vinyl acetate was removed as a Worst Case Release Scenario as there is only one process and the off-site impacts of vinyl acetate is much less than that of acrylonitrile.\r\n-Update 3: Toxics: Alternative Case - The alternative case scenarios have been updated to reflect more accurate release rates as well as using dikes as the only passive mitigation.\r\n-Update 4: All section have been updated to reflect personnel and date changes."
