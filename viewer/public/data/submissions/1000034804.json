      "SummaryText": "Hammond Cold Storage management is commited to a safe work environment for it's employees and the community.  Hammond Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehouse facility.  The facility has a Risk Management Program (RMP) which complies with the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The facility is also complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 CFR 1910.119.  The Hammond Cold Storage PSM/RMP, along with other company safety and training programs, deal with the risks involved in the process utilizing hazardous chemicals.  In this way Hammond Cold Storage promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoid physical property and environmental damage.\n\nThe Hammond Cold Storage facility safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release is considered a single process.  The facility safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThe process covered by the Hammond Cold Storage PSM/RMP is the ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the refrigeration system serving the facility by cooling the warehouse spaces.  The refrigeration process involves a typical vapor c"

      "SummaryText": "ompression refrigeration cycle with compressors, condensers, heat exchangers, and evaporators.  The system is closed and is designed to completely contain the ammonia refrigerant within vessels, equipment and piping specifically constructed for ammonia refrigeration.  Liquid ammonia is circulated from the vessels to the evaporators which cool the refrigerated spaces by boiling off some of the liquid to vapor.  The ammonia then returns to the vessels where liquid is separated from vapor.  The vapor enters the compressors and is discharged at higher pressure to the condensers.  The vapor is cooled and condenses to liquid in the condenser and then is drained to the vessels to repeat the refrigeration cycle.\n\nIn addition to the implementation of safety programs in compliance with the OSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP regulations the Hammond Cold Storage refrigeration system has been constructed in accordance with applicable codes and standards.  Standard operating procedures and training programs have been developed for the facility personnel to specifically address the characteristics of the refrigeration system.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the Hammond Cold Storage facility.  The facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119).  Hammond Cold Storage has trained emplyees in the Emergency Action Plan and maintain the plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nThe Hammond Cold Storage Facility has a management system in place which has been developed to assure that the PSM/RMP is implemented, documented and updated to assure its effectiveness."
