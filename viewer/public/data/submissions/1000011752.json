We will maintain security staff on-site at all times to monitor and patrol the site, and control access by the train crews that are responsible for moving the tank cars. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Whitman County Sheriff's Dispatch to provide first response capability and site control.  Canexus U.S Inc. has a relationship with NRC Environmental Services (NRC), an emergency response contractor with offices in Spokane, Seattle and Pasco, WA who would respond initially to any incident on behalf of Canexus.  NRC advises it could have personnel on-site within 2 hours of call-out.  In addition, the Canadian affiliate of Canexus maintains a fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team (CHLOREP) in North Vancouver which provides mutual aid response to any Chlorine Institute member in Washington State.  Members from our team could respond to any incident requiring detailed Technical Advice, rail car leak repair and/or product transfer capabilities.  \n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThis facility is a railway siding providing bulk storage of liquid chlorine tank cars. The facility is owned by the Washington Idaho Railway and is located at the Belmont Railway Station in the Palouse River valley in a rural area approximately 5 miles southeast of Oakesdale, WA. All movements of rail cars will be handled by Washington Idaho Railway personnel. The facility will be fenced with a six-foot chain link fence topped with razor wire. There will be no flammable material stored at the site and vegetation will be controlled to m"

Each chlorine rail car can hold up to 180,000 lbs of liquid chlorine. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one tank car resulting in a toxic gas release. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a release of chlorine gas from the relief valve due to high ambient temperatures or failure of the relief valve leading to a 60 minute release. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nCanexus U.S. Inc. and its Canadian Affiliate, Canexus Chemicals Canada LP, are international suppliers of liquid chlorine to industry. As members of the Canadian Chemical Producers\u00c2\u00bf Association, the American Chemistry Council and the Chlorine Institute, Canexus is required to meet the requirements of the Responsible Care\u00c2\u00a9 program. This program requires all facilities to comply with or exceed all applicable state and local codes and regulations to ensure the risks to people, property and the environment are managed to an acceptable level. The prevention program that is in place at the North Vancouver facility will be similarly applied at this rail siding storage location. In addition, the facility will comply with the requirements developed by the Department of Homeland security as part of its Chemical Security Assessment Tool Top Screen.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nIn the past five years, Canexus has not had an accident in North America involving chlorine tank cars that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place. \n\nThe emergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency involvin"
