Introduction:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen facility in North\n\nBend, OH purchases anhydrous ammonia and brings\n\nit into the plant by barge line and rail car.\n\nAmmonia is burned over precious metal gauze and\n\nconverted into nitric acid.  Additional ammonia\n\nis reacted with nitric acid to make ammonium\n\nnitrate. The urea is brought in by truck or rail\n\ncar and blended with ammonium nitrate to make a\n\nsolution of urea and ammonium nitrate with 28%\n\ntotal nitrogen.  The facility has storage and\n\nshipping capability for all of its final\n\nproducts.  Sales from this facility are from\n\nnitric acid, anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia,\n\nammonium nitrate, and fertilizer solutions,\n\nwhich are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and urea.\n\n\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen North Bend facility\n\nhas an excellent safety record with no deaths or\n\nserious injuries to plant personnel or\n\ncontractors since it was constructed in 1965.\n\nIn addition, the plant has operated without a\n\nlost time accident for over 21 years, and over\n\n1,552,544 man-hours. There have been no RMP\n\nreportable releases of toxic chemicals in the\n\nlast 5 years.\n\n\n\n* In case of a reportable chemical accident,\n\n   information in the RMP will be updated within\n\n   six (6) months of the date accident accured.\n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and\n\nProgram:\n\n\n\nAs part of the management system for Process\n\nSafety Management, a plant wide computer system\n\nis utilized which incorporates maintenance and\n\nprocess safety. Computers located in strategic\n\nlocations are used to access plant\n\nfiles for P&ID drawings, operating procedures,\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) documents, and other\n\npertinent documents.  This system is used to\n\nprovide our employees with the necessary tools and\n\nrecords for process safety requirements.  It plays\n\nan integral part in the safety effort"

Royster-Clark Nitrogen\n\nworks closely with industry and government groups\n\nand local emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees to\n\nparticipate in all facets of process safety and\n\naccident prevention.  Examples of employee\n\nparticipation include updating and compiling\n\ntechnical documents, the availability of process\n\nsafety information via networked computers to\n\nall employees, participation in Process Hazard\n\nAnalyses, and periodic employee training.\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has an employee\n\nparticipation plan that documents many other\n\nways employees are involved in accident\n\nprevention and process safety.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive\n\nprogram to help ensure that hazards associated\n\nwith the various processes are identified and\n\ncontrolled. Within this system, each process is\n\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and\n\nensure that adequate controls are in place to\n\nmanage these hazards.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has well-established\n\nPractices and procedures to maintain pressure\n\nvessels, piping systems, relief and vent\n\nsystems,controls, pumps and compressors, and\n\nemergency shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nTraining of plant personnel includes: (1) an\n\nOverview of the process, (2) safety and health\n\nhazards,(3) emergency response plans, and\n\n4) applicable safe work practices.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive\n\nsystem to manage changes to the processes.\n\nThis system requires that process changes be\n\nreviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in\n\nplace to manage any new hazards, and verify that\n\nexisting controls have not been compromised.\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process\n\nOperating limits, equipment information and\n\nprocedures are updated to incorporate these changes.\n\nIn addition, all effected personnel receive\n\ntraining on the change.\n\n\n\nD.

The most\n\nlikely release scenario would involve a release\n\nof hot anhydrous ammonia from a pressure relief\n\nvalve on the ammonia vaporizer bottle in the\n\nnitric acid plant. This part of the process\n\ninvolves anhydrous ammonia under elevated\n\ntemperatures and pressures. This alternative\n\nscenario results in offsite consequences.\n\nAs part of our Process Safety Management System,\n\nwe have in place inspection and other measures\n\nintended to ensure the integrity of our process.\n\nSpecifically, the process equipment is inspected\n\non a regular basis.\n\n\n\nF.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario:\n\nSeveral possible aqua ammonia release scenarios\n\nwere evaluated but the diked loading operation\n\nwas selected as the scenario since it involves\n\nuse of hoses and truck connections.  This\n\nalternative scenario results in offsite\n\nconsequences.\n\n\n\nG.   Nitric Acid Alternative Release:\n\nThis facility brings 98% concentrated nitric\n\nacid in by truck.  The strong acid is\n\nimmediately diluted with product\n\nacid to 83-84%.  No acid is stored above 85%\n\nstrength.  The loading operation was selected as\n\nthe alternative scenario because this is the\n\nonly time 85% or higher strength acid is in the\n\nplant.  Standard unloading procedures and\n\nequipment checks are in place to reduce the\n\npossibility of an incident. This alternative\n\nscenario results in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nH.
