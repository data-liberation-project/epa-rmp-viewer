Finished products are non-hazardous and take the form of a low-viscosity, milky-white liquid emulsion.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nEPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information about all accidents in the last five years involving an RMP-regulated substance if the accident resulted in (1) death, injury according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on-site, or (2) known deaths, injuries, or property or environmental damage off-site.\n\nThe Mogadore Latex Plant has not had any accidents meeting this regulatory definition within the last five years.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\nEPA regulations, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Responsible Care(R) Initiative of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) require the Mogadore Latex Plant to conduct hazard assessments of regulated processes.  EPA regulations specifically require off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the form of worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for certain regulated substances.\n\nOMNOVA is concerned that these worst-case scenarios required to be disclosed under the RMP regulations may overstate the risk of a worst-case release.  For example, the EPA-published look-up tables do not take any local physical conditions into account.  An alternative to the look-up tables (allowed by the regulation) is to calculate release scenarios based on recognized risk analysis techniques, or models.  Limited consideration of local conditions is used in the models within strict EPA guidelines.  Accordingly, OMNOVA used the EPA-recognized models in preparing its release scenarios.  While these models may be more accurate than the look-up tables, they can still result in highly improbable and, in some cases, physically impossible risk scenarios.  For example, neither look-up tables nor models allow consideration of existing active safe"

The models also increase the number of specific data points examined and, thus, present the most accurate information possible using all required inputs.\n\nOMNOVA has also prepared alternative release scenarios which it believes are more accurate predictions of potential accidental releases from the Mogadore Latex Plant.  Alternative release scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than worst-case scenarios, but they are still very improbable due to engineering and administrative controls in place at the Mogadore Latex Plant.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to develop one worst-case scenario to represent all toxic substances and one worst-case scenario to represent all flammable substances from lists of regulated materials.  Additional worst-case scenarios are required if different public receptors (off-site residences, businesses, or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material.  OMNOVA is not subject to this additional requirement.\n\nWhen examining the following worst-case and alternative release scenarios, it is important to keep in mind that OMNOVA has numerous safety systems in place at its Mogadore Latex Plant to effectively prevent these situations.  These systems, most of which were not taken into consideration under the EPA regulations, include leak detection systems, continuous monitoring and automatic controls, automatic shutdown systems, deluge water systems, secondary containment dikes and vaults, and employees specially trained in chemical handling and emergency response methods.\n\nFlammable Materials:\n\nOMNOVA's Mogadore Latex Plant has one regulated flammable substance covered by the regulation:  1,3-butadiene.

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION:\n\nThis document was prepared as part of the Risk Management Program (RMP) of the Mogadore Latex Plant of OMNOVA Solutions Inc., Performance Chemicals business segment (OMNOVA).  The RMP conforms to the legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The purpose of the RMP is to:\n\n-- Describe existing safety systems at the Mogadore Latex Plant designed to protect employees, the community, the environment, and the process;\n-- Share information with the community about operations at the Mogadore Latex Plant, including steps taken to minimize the risks from regulated substances; and\n-- Comply with applicable environmental laws and EPA regulations (Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]).\n\nThe following is an overview of the Mogadore Latex Plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs:\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY:\n\nOMNOVA and the Mogadore Latex Plant are and always have been committed to safe operations as their Number One priority.  This commitment begins with qualified people and is reflected at all levels of the operation.  All employees at the Mogadore Latex Plant are provided with the training, tools, and empowerment to perform their part of the operation in a safe manner.  Strict operational controls are in place to ensure safety from the conceptual stage through product development, manufacturing, and delivery to customers.  The Mogadore Latex Plant has a staff of safety and environmental professionals, engineers, and security personnel to assure implementation of, and on-going commitment to, the highest standards of safe process management.  This experience and professional competence have resulted in many years of safe operations which consistently exceed industry averages.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED PROCESS:\n\nThe Mogadore Latex Plant produces styrene-butadiene (SB) and styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile (SBA) latex produ"

The endpoint of a vapor cloud explosion is defined as the distance at which the overpressure from the blast reaches 1 psig.\n\nOMNOVA considers this worst-case scenario to be highly improbable; in fact, it may be physically impossible due to the array of active mitigation systems in place to prevent such an occurrence.  These include deluge systems around the storage tank, flammable vapor sensors for early detection, and diking to reduce the release's surface area and evaporation rate.  Additionally, the atmospheric conditions required as inputs to the model are unlikely, if not impossible.  For example, the temperature used must equal the highest area temperature in the last three years, usually occurring in the afternoon, yet the wind speed must be very low, with very stable air, which usually occurs shortly after midnight.\n\nToxic Materials:\n\nOMNOVA's Mogadore Latex Plant has two regulated toxic materials on-site:  29% ammonium hydroxide solution and acrylonitrile.  EPA regulations require one worst-case scenario to represent all regulated toxic materials.\n\nOMNOVA's worst-case toxic scenario assumes the release of the entire contents of an ammonium hydroxide storage tank into the containment dike beneath the tank, with the additional assumption that the material stays in the containment area without any mitigation measures to limit the amount that is evaporated to the atmosphere.  Again, OMNOVA does not think this worst-case scenario is likely, and it may not be possible due to the conservative assumptions required by the regulation.  An array of mitigation systems are in place to reduce the severity of any potential release.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nApplicable EPA regulations also require facilities to submit one alternative release scenario to represent all flammables and one to represent each toxic m"

      "SummaryText": "aterial.\n\nFlammable Materials:\n\nOMNOVA's alternative release scenario for flammables is the instantaneous release of 45 pounds of 1,3-butadiene as a result of an unloading hose failure.  The distance to endpoint, or 1 psig overpressure, from this scenario is 123 feet.  Although this endpoint extends beyond the nearest facility boundary, there are no public receptors within this radius.\n\nToxic Materials:\n\nOMNOVA's alternative release scenario for 29% ammonium hydroxide solution involves the loss of the contents from a four-inch diameter transfer pipe approximately 400 feet long.\n\nOMNOVA's alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile involves a release into secondary containment for ten minutes before the release flows to a tertiary containment vault.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nOMNOVA began a formal PSM program at its Mogadore Latex Plant in 1992 after OSHA promulgated regulations found at 29 CFR 1910.119.  The effectiveness of the PSM program, in conjunction with high-quality engineering design, employee safety programs, Responsible Care(R) implementation, EPA's RMP requirements, and emergency response programs, make up OMNOVA's Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:\n\nOMNOVA's overall safety efforts at the Mogadore Latex Plant consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials, as well as programs to mitigate the effects of an actual release.  The Mogadore Latex Plant has a trained and properly equipped team of volunteer emergency responders capable of handling most foreseeable emergency situations.  Importantly, coordination with local safety forces is a key element of the emergency response planning process.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the Mogadore Latex Plant.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nIntrinsic safety is a key element in the design of all process equipment at OMNOVA's Mogadore Latex Plant.

In addition, formal accident and incident investigation procedures are in place so that causes of even the smallest failures are identified and corrected."
