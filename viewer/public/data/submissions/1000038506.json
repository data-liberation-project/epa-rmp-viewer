              "Description": "I.    Employee Participation\n\n\n\nEmployees will be expected to participate in various elements of our Process Safety Management Program, including the development and implementation of operating and maintenance procedures.  Employees will be consulted about and will have input into the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and the development of the other elements of Process Safety Management. The findings and recommendations of the process hazards analyses will be made available to all affected employees through postings and safety meetings.\n\n\n\nII.    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nFor new plants, the engineering/construction company building the plant will provide most of the information. The project manager is responsible for insuring all process safety information is compiled prior to the process hazards analysis.\n\n\n\nThe facility manager is responsible for insuring this process safety information is compiled, maintained and utilized in subsequent process hazards analyses. Process hazards analyses documents will be kept current and up to date with respect to changes being made in the plant consistent with management of change guidelines.\n\n\n\nIII.    Process Hazards Analysis\n\n\n\nA process hazards analysis shall be performed on all new process facilities. A formal process hazards analysis shall be performed on all process units that have undergone significant modification. Significant modifications would include conversion of unit service, major reconstruction, or total change in chemical process. Other, minor process unit modifications may be handled through procedure provisions of management of change.\n\nProcess hazards analyses shall be performed on all existing facilities regulated by the process safety management and risk management plan programs. Process hazards analysis requirements shall be reviewed, revalidated and updated on a periodic basis as changes are made to regulations, or new information is provided through industry experience.\n\n\n\nResponsibility for developing, implementing, scheduling and managing the process hazards analysis program in accordance with this guideline resides with the facility manager.\n\nFor new facilities, the project manager is responsible for initiating the process hazards analysis process by, contacting the appropriate facility manager. The initial process hazards analysis should be performed as soon as sufficient process safety information is available and prior to major construction.\n\n\n\nAfter the initial PHA, the facility manager is responsible for initiating the management of change related process hazards analyses and ensuring operating and other facility personnel are available to participate in process hazards analyses as team members.\n\n\n\nFor revalidations of existing facilities, the facility manager will be responsible for initiating the process hazards analyses. The revalidation team shall verify that operating conditions noted in the original study are still valid for the current operations. The revalidation team shall also review each incident that had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, which occurred since the previous study. The revalidation shall document that safeguards are in place to prevent the incident from recurring. The revalidation process also entails a review of the management of change records since the previous study. Changes that have affected engineering controls, facility siting, human factors, or process safety information should be scrutinized for their impact on the process hazards analysis. The revalidation process hazards analysis shall be kept for the life of the facility. The revalidated process hazards analysis action items shall be addressed in the same manner as the original process hazards analysis.\n\n\n\nIV.    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures will provide specific instructions or details on what steps are to be taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures. Operating procedures are an essential component of the training program at each plant.  However, they cannot be the sole means of qualifying employees to operate a facility because, not all the need-to-know information is contained within the procedures to safely operate that facility. Caliber Midstream Training Program is designed to allow an employee to safely operate a facility according to clear, concise operating procedures. Any new employees or employees who change jobs must be trained in the operating procedures before operating a covered process. The procedures must be implemented and managed at each facility, and must be consistent with the facility's processes and process safety information.\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the facility manager to ensure that written procedures are developed prior to initial startup of the facility. It is also the responsibility of the facility manager to ensure that operating procedures are maintained and are certified annually.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the project manager to ensure that the process safety information is available for developing operating procedures prior to initial startup of a new facility.\n\n\n\nV.    Training\n\n\n\nAll employees involved in the operation of a covered process must be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures. For employees in jobs operating a covered process under the risk management plan standard, the operator training certification form will be completed by the appropriate facility manager. A file containing these forms will be maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nEach employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment shall be trained in an overview of the process and its hazards and the applicable operating procedures to ensure that the employee is qualified to perform the job tasks in a safe manner. Contract personnel involved in operating a covered process must meet the same training standards as company personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility manager is responsible for ensuring that a process safety management training plan is developed and implemented at their facility. This training program must include: procedures for administering the training plan, job analyses, job specific training curriculums, initial training, refresher training, and supplemental training, procedures for maintaining training documentation.\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of each employee to: participate in the training program, apply the training appropriately to their job and provide input on the frequency of refresher training.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the environment health and safety department to: assist with performance of job analyses and develop the level 1 curriculum and training material.\n\n\n\nTraining must take place and be documented to ensure that employees have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities applicable to their job tasks.\n\n\n\nThe environment health and safety department and the facility manager have the responsibility to ensure that job specific training curriculums are identified, developed, and utilized to train and qualify employees who work in the facility. The facility manager may delegate these duties to employees who will serve as facility process safety management training coordinators.\n\n\n\nAll tests content shall be representative of the content of the training material. All tests shall be current and shall be kept in a secure location. Each module of training within each level shall be tested. All tests shall be administered under conditions that are conducive to successful performance.\n\n\n\nVI.    Contractors\n\n\n\nCompliance with this element of OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and EPA?s regulations shall be achieved through the application of the programs defined in Caliber Midstream Safety Policies.  \n\n\n\nVII.    Pre-Startup Review\n\n\n\nCaliber Midstream shall perform a Pre-Startup Safety Review for new process safety management facilities and for modified process safety management facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n\n\nThe designated project manager is responsible for making sure that the initial Pre-Startup Safety Review for new projects and modifications to existing facilities is initiated. The facility manager or his designee is responsible for the conduct of this Pre-Startup Safety Review. The designated project Manager will ensure that necessary technical support is available to the facility manager to allow him to conduct the Pre-Startup Safety Review.\n\n\n\nTheir responsibility includes the assignment/recruitment and supervision of appropriate personnel to carry out the Pre-Startup Safety Review process. Team members may include persons from Operations, Safety, Engineering and other departments as necessary. The facility manager or his designee will be a member of this team. The team shall make recommendations concerning startup and these will be documented.\n\n\n\nFor all new facility startups, facility turnarounds, and major modifications: Final authorization to startup shall be granted by the general manager.\n\n\n\nVIII.    Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nIt will be the responsibility of each facility manager to implement a site specific Mechanical Integrity Program.  The facility manager may assign an individual to coordinate the Mechanical Integrity Program at the site. The environment health and safety department is responsible for providing a scope document that will give guidance for selection of inspection/testing contractors as well as selection of inspection/testing methods. Proper documentation is a vital part of a mechanical integrity program. Therefore, it is imperative that all activities within this guideline be documented.\n\n\n\nEach facility shall prepare and maintain a critical equipment list. Critical equipment is defined as any individual item, device, or system that is directly or indirectly responsible for the containment and/or control of a flammable or other highly hazardous material.  Types of critical equipment may include, but not be limited to:  Pressure vessels, piping systems, tanks, pumps, emergency shutdown devices, safety interlocks, and fire suppression equipment.  Critical equipment must be maintained and included in an overall preventative maintenance program.\n\n\n\nIX.    Hot Work Permit\n\n\n\nA hot work permit form must be issued before hot work is performed within the bounds of facility fences or outside of designated safe welding areas. This requirement applies to plant.  \n\n\n\nThe supervisor or their designate, has the direct responsibility for verifying that the necessary steps are taken to assure that hot work is performed safely.   Only then will a properly completed permit be issued.\n\nThe supervisor in charge may delegate authority, but not the responsibility, for the inspection and issuance of the permit to qualified Company personnel.  A list of authorized permit writers for each facility should be maintained at the respective facility.  Personnel must receive formal training in order to be qualified to issue permits.\n\n\n\nA Job Safety / Hazard Analysis should be conducted for all hot work jobs and documented by the person supervising the hot work prior to starting the work.  \n\n\n\nInspection of the hot work program will be conducted to ensure employees are following the provisions of the hot work program.  Inspections shall be conducted at least annually.   This inspection shall be done on a random basis.\n\n\n\nX.    Management of Change\n\n\n\nThe intent of the Caliber Midstream Management of Change process is to ensure that any approved ?not-in-kind? modifications made to covered equipment, systems, chemicals, operating procedures, maintenance procedures or any other covered items are done safely and in accordance with good operating practices.\n\nThis process is intended to be used solely for the purpose of ensuring safe implementation and documentation of ?not-in-kind? changes associated with previously approved projects and/or procedures at process safety management governed facilities. The management of change process is not intended for economic screening or evaluation of new projects. However, following this process for initial management of change screening of proposed projects can aid in their development and planning. The management of change process may also add value by assisting the conceptual studies to determine if the change is technically feasible, safe and environmentally sound.\n\n\n\nThe management of change is intended to control changes to process safety management governed facilities by systematically subjecting them to technical reviews, authorizations, proper implementation and follow-up procedures. Each of these changes shall be documented and communicated, and training shall be provided to all affected employees and contractors. A successful management of change program will ensure that changes will not result in unsafe situations and that employees will be aware of all changes and their implications.\n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager shall evaluate the complexity of the change and assure appropriate personnel are assigned to a management of change committee to assist in the review of the change. The following five aspects of the change must be evaluated; Safety, Operations, Engineering, Maintenance and Environmental. The quantity of people to be assigned to the committee shall be left to the discretion of the facility management of change coordinator. Committee members should have expertise in an area that the change involves.\n\n\n\nThe committee will either, determine what actions should be taken to safely implement the change or reject the change and issue an explanation for their rejection to the originating party. When a management of change has been approved by the management of change committee, it will be the responsibility of the facility management of change coordinator to provide the final verification that all of the review processes required to implement the change have been completed prior to submittal of the change for final approval by the facility manager.   The change cannot be implemented without the final authorization and signature of the facility manager on the management of change form.\n\n\n\nXI.    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe policy of Caliber Midstream to report and investigate all incidents with the intent of identifying basic causes and taking proper corrective actions. Investigations will be conducted with the premise of finding the basic factors relating to the incident, and not to assign blame. Disciplinary action generally will not be imposed as a result of the information provided during an investigation, unless, for example, there is clear evidence of negligence or disregard of a company rule or procedure or misrepresentation of the facts.\n\n\n\nXII.    Emergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nCompliance with this element of OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and the EPA regulations shall be achieved through the application of the programs defined in Caliber Midstream Emergency Action Plan or Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nXIII.    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nCaliber Midstream is responsible for audit team training and scheduling, monitoring and maintaining the PSM Audit Programs.\n\n\n\nResponsibility for implementing corrective actions to address findings identified in the PSM Audit\n\nPrograms rests with the Operations.\n\nCompliance audits function to provide the following:\n\n\n\n?     Provide review of asset PSM management programs\n\n?     Provide feedback to management on the effectiveness of those programs\n\n?     Assist assets in maintaining compliance with government requirements and standards\n\n?     Identify best practices and facilitate continuous improvement\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nCaliber Midstream is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors. The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.    \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant is located near Alexander in McKenzie County, North Dakota. It is comprised of two (2) processes:  Natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction and crude oil polishing / purification.  The crude oil polishing process is the removal of water from a crude oil inlet stream and the capture of hydrocarbon gas during handing and stabilization.  The process involves an exempt substance and is therefore exempt from the rule.  The extraction of natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas stream occurs with propane refrigeration.  NGL is stored in three (3) product storage tanks for transportation off site.  These tanks are each above the threshold quantity of a mixed flammable substance.  The remaining natural gas (primarily methane) is transported off site by pipeline.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Hay Butte Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific PSM program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. Since this facility is a Program Level 3 facility, a prevention program has been developed and implemented that complies with RMP.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in of"

      "SummaryText": "fsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCaliber Midstream believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Caliber continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Caliber also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority.\n\n"
