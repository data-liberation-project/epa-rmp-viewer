The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.    \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant is located near Alexander in McKenzie County, North Dakota. It is comprised of two (2) processes:  Natural gas liquids (NGL) extraction and crude oil polishing / purification.  The crude oil polishing process is the removal of water from a crude oil inlet stream and the capture of hydrocarbon gas during handing and stabilization.  The process involves an exempt substance and is therefore exempt from the rule.  The extraction of natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas stream occurs with propane refrigeration.  NGL is stored in three (3) product storage tanks for transportation off site.  These tanks are each above the threshold quantity of a mixed flammable substance.  The remaining natural gas (primarily methane) is transported off site by pipeline.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Hay Butte Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific PSM program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. Since this facility is a Program Level 3 facility, a prevention program has been developed and implemented that complies with RMP.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Hay Butte Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in of"

The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCaliber Midstream believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Caliber continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Caliber also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority.\n\n"
