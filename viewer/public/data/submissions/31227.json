      "SummaryText": "At all three facilities owned by Smith Bros. Farm Supply, Inc.  the following policies are performed on March 1 of each year. The CEO and all three Branch Managers, independent of each other, review and inspect all ammonia equipment and facilities at each of the three locations. Notes are made and discussed on March 5. If there are any deficiencies noted by anyone a follow-up inspection is again performed by the same personnel on March 20 at which time the deficiencies will have been corrected. On April 1 the CEO gives one last inspection insuring that all equipment is in proper operating order before the season starts on approximately April 10. All employees are required to attend an ammonia safety training class during March of each year. All long-time employees are observed by the CEO and Branch Managers filling ammonia nurse tanks and other related activities concerning ammonia. New-hires, if there are any, are not permitted to work at the facility by themselves. A senior person must be present for them to even touch the loading equipment until such time as they are deemed to be totally competent. We have not had any accidential releases at any of our three locations within the past five years. In fact, I cannot recall a time when we have ever had a release. Should a release occur our first call will be made to the Fire Department and the next call to our LEPC.  Anyhydrous Ammonia is a very important farm input product. It is by far the most economical form of nitrogen that today's farmer can use. It is unfortunate that is has the properties is has but we have lived with Anyhydrous Ammonia for almost firty years without a serious mishap."
