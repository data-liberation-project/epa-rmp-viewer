      "SummaryText": "The Appleton Papers Inc., Spring Mill  (Spring Mill), Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania pulp and paper mill has been in operation at its current location since 1865. Appleton itself was founded in 1907, and has earned a reputation as an innovative producer of carbonless and thermal papers used in a variety of commercial printing and specialty applications. Our 485-employee workforce is comprised of production, maintenance, engineering, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us for 25 years.  We are proud of our facility and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nSpring Mill has two chemicals, chlorine (Cl2) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2), that are currently used to bleach pulp.  These chemicals meet the toxic chemicals TQs, and thus, these must be included in a Risk Management Program for their respective operations.   The TQ for Cl2  is 2,500 pounds and the quantity contained in our process exceeds the TQ.   Plans are currently underway at the facility to eliminate the use of Cl2 by October, 2000.\n\nThe TQ for ClO2 is 1,000 pounds and the quantity contained in our process exceeds the TQ.  As part of Spring Mill's commitment to the environment, in 1997 a 2 million dollar air pollution control system was installed as an upgrade to the former pollution control system to control process emissions of Cl2 and ClO2 at the Roaring Spring facility.\n\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112(r"

The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of our program is fully and effectively completed.  The Mill Manager accepts overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program elements.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios as appropriate to the operations.  From the release scenarios, facilities are then to determine offsite impacts using specified offsite consequence analysis (OCA) parameters for worst-case releases and more realistic parameters for alternative releases.\n\nAs described by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) the worst-case scenario involves the release of the largest quantity of a listed toxic substance that is estimated to generate the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint defined in the 112(r) regulation.  The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of such a release are not considered.\n\nAlso, the alternative scenario involves an accidental release that is \"more likely\" to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Scenarios to consider include transfer hose splits or uncoupl"

Approximately 203 pounds of chlorine is released, which is the quantity contained in \n        piping.  Safety systems limit the release duration to 1 minute.\n\n     -  For ClO2, we assumed a failure in the chlorine dioxide solution piping between the supply pump and \n        the end use points in the bleach plant. Approximately 167 pounds of chlorine dioxide is released from \n        a height of approximately 20 feet. Manual safety systems limit the release duration to 5 minute.  The \n        release quantity is based on the supply pump's discharge capacity against almost zero head.\n\nThe OCA of the chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  Air dispersion modeling is the use of a computer to simulate the spread of air pollutants.  Dispersion modeling can be used to determine the movement and concentration of toxic gases emitted from an accidental release. \n\nTo determine the OCA of worst-case and alternative releases of Cl2 and ClO2, Spring Mill used the most-recent version of USEPA's RMP*Comp modeling software.  RMP*Comp is based on the USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 1996) that provides rough estimates of offsite impacts from evaporating pools of chemicals and vapor clouds.\n\nThe OCA for our worst-case rele"

The OCA for our Cl2 alternative release scenario indicated that the Cl2 piping failure could impact an area with an estimated population of 80.  The area of impact was determined to be that area which could experience a Cl2 concentration above the Emergency Response Planning Guideline - Level 2 (ERPG-2).  According to USEPA documentation, this level represents the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe OCA for our ClO2 alternative release scenario indicated that the ClO2 piping failure could impact an area with an estimated population of 1,300.  The area of impact was determined to be that area which could experience a ClO2 concentration above one tenth the \"Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health\" level.\n\nPopulations were determined using Landview III, a computer program which incorporates U.S. Census data.  Population estimates for the two alternative release scenarios were refined based on a windshield survey of the area surrounding the mill.\n\nShould an accidental release occur that has potential for offsite consequences, plant-wide alarms will sound.  Trained plant personnel will take immediate and rapid action, and emergency shutdowns systems and procedures will be activated.\n\nModeling Limitations and Assumptions\n\nAir-dispersion models are limited in their ability to accurately predict the impact of a chemical release.  Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  In general, the USEPA-recommended models used for the Spring Mill worst-case and alternative release scenarios have likely over-estimated the impact distance, because of several complicating "

      "SummaryText": "conditions:\n\n     -  Surrounding the Cl2 rail cars, ClO2  storage tanks, and associated system piping are large industrial\n        buildings and structures.  These features disrupt and redirect air flow, but the models used assume \n        winds are steady and moving in a straight line.\n\n     -  Beyond plant property, buildings, structures, vegetation, and terrain features also serve to disrupt \n        and redirect air flow.\n\n     -  The chemicals emitted are assumed to have no reaction with the ground, other chemicals, or other \n        potential release conditions. However, it is likely that a release of Cl2 and ClO2 will deposit on the \n        ground and other surfaces as it disperses from a ground-level source. Cl2 and ClO2 may also react \n        with other chemicals or with fire.  In each case, the resulting impact distance is likely to be less than \n        the distance predicted by the models.  Note that a \"synergistic effect\" can occur from two chemicals \n        interacting during an accidental release.  Such synergism results when the effect of two substances \n        acting together \"is greater than the sum of their individual effects.\"\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release. The completion of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements essentially satisfies the 112(r) Prevention Program requirements for Cl2 and ClO2 in the Program-level 3 processes.\n\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an important component of the 112(r) rule.

Operations are continuously monitored by \n        computer. Written procedures are in place and followed by operators.\n\n     -  Operations Auditing:  Internal and Independent audits of the Cl2 and ClO2 systems are performed.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, one RMP reportable accidental release occurred at Spring Mill.  On September 21, 1996 an accidental release of an estimated 35 pounds of chlorine from the bleaching process caused an injury to an employee working at the wet end of No. 2 Paper Machine.  The employee suffered from a sore throat and coughing following an exposure to the chlorine release.  The employee sought treatment from his family doctor following the exposure.  His physician treated the symptoms, and subsequently performed a chest x-ray to check for any serious or lingering effects of the chlorine exposure - none were indicated.  The employee's chlorine exposure did not result in any lost time or long-term health effects.  This injury was the only onsite impact of the release"

      "SummaryText": ", and there were no known (or expected) offsite impacts.\n\nTwo corrective actions were taken following the accidental release.  The direct cause of the release , a malfunctioning automatic valve, was repaired.  Also, two additional sensors were added to the mill's existing chlorine/chlorine dioxide detection and alarm system.  These sensors improve employee safety in the No. 2 Paper Machine wet end area, and allow quicker bleach plant operator response (shutdown of chemical feed, etc.) in the event of any future incidents of this nature.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan is in place at Spring Mill and will be implemented as required for the purpose of protecting our employees, the public and the environment.  Spring Mill is also included in the Emergency Response Plan maintained by the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan consists of training and planning to prepare for, prevent and mitigate the release of chemicals from the covered processes.  As it applies to our two covered processes and chemicals, the program makes use of our multi-point chemical detection and alarm system and our Bleach Plant operating personnel.  Bleach Plant personnel were chosen for this task for two primary reasons:\n\n     -  There are three Bleach Plant personnel in the mill at all times, and they work in the immediate vicinity \n        of the covered processes and chemicals.\n\n     -  They posses more training on, and working knowledge of, the covered processes than anyone else \n        in the mill.\n\nThe plan dictates the nature and extent of our actions based on the magnitude of the release, as indicated by the detection system (for Cl2) or by use of an MSA \"Kwik-Draw\" Sampler (for ClO2).  All Bleach Plant personnel have been trained in the procedures called for in the Emergency Action Plan, as have all Pulp Mill Shift Supervisors.\n\nIn addition to in-plant activities, the Emergency Action Plan contains provisions to notify ou"

All necessary assistance (hazmat, fire, ambulance, police, etc.) would be contacted by dialing 911 and would be coordinated by Blair County 911 Emergency Operations Center.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSpring Mill is in the midst of making comprehensive changes to its bleaching process which will result in significant environmental and safety improvements.  Upon completion of these changes, currently planned for October 2000, we will eliminate the use of Cl2 in our bleach plant. \n\nWe are committed to the safety and well being of our employees, our community and the environment.  To that end, we will continue to explore measures aimed at reducing the risks posed by our processes."
