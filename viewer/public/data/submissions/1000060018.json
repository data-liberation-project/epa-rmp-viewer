      "SummaryText": "This is an executive summary of the policies, procedures and activities for compliance with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements - Risk Management Program pursuant to 40 CFR 68 for Tesoro Logistics Robinson Lake Gas Plant. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the individual RMP/PSM procedures which detail the RMP / PSM program requirements as well as how Tesoro Logistics will comply with the applicable requirements. The site is not a responding facility for releases of the RMP listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n\n\nLocation:\n\nThe Robinson Lake Gas Plant is located in Mountrail County, approximately seventeen (17) miles south of Stanley, North Dakota, or 4 miles south of Belden, immediately east of HWY 8.  The legal location is in NW1/4 NW1/4 of Section 23, Township 153N, Range 91W. \n\n\n\nGeneric Process Description:\n\nThe plant processes raw natural gas delivered from wells.  The plant processes consists of separation of natural gas liquids (NGL) from the natural gas delivered from the wells.  Processed natural gas is sold via pipeline.  The NGL product separated from the natural gas is stored in three (3) 90,000 gallon tanks.  The NGL product is then fractionated into propane, butane and natural gasoline.  Product propane is stored in four (4) 90,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks and sold via truck.   Product butane is stored in three (3) 90,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks and sold via truck.  The natural gasoline is stored in four (4) 400 bbl. tanks and is sold via truck. \n\n \n\nDetailed Process Description:\n\nCurrently, the Robinson Lake Gas Plant has the physical capacity to process up to approximately 130 MMscf/day of field natural gas.  The field gas is sweet and contains trace am"

      "SummaryText": "ounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S).  This field gas enters the facility and passes through an inlet separation process where entrained liquids are separated from the raw gas stream.  While most of the oil production occurs at the wellhead locations, any additional oil/condensate production at the plant inlet is routed to condensate storage.  Oil/condensate flows into a 400 bbl. separation tank where water is separated from the oil/condensate.  The water flows into a 400 bbl. produced water storage tank.  Oil/condensate flows into a sales condensate tank.  Water and oil/condensate is loaded out by truck as needed.  The condensate storage system operates at atmospheric pressure and all vapors are routed to a tank flare system.\n\nThe inlet gas stream from the inlet separator is routed to the inlet compressors.  The inlet compressors are driven by electric motors.  These units compress the inlet gas to a pressure of approximately 500 psig for processing.  The compressed gas can be directed to one of two processing skids. The processing skids are alike in operation and use similar equipment.  The following process description includes both of the processing skids.  The compressed gas is routed through a series of heat exchangers and a gas chiller for NGL recovery.  The cooling/chilling for processing is accomplished using electric driven refrigeration compressors and associated refrigeration system vessels.  Ethylene glycol (EG) is injected into the heat exchangers and gas chiller to remove water from the gas stream.  The gas stream and injected EG is routed to a low temperature separator.  The main components separated in the low temperature separator consist of: processed gas, natural gas liquids, and water/EG.  \n\nProcessed gas from the low temperature separator can either flow through the Triethylene Glycol (TEG) system or is directly routed back to the 4th stage of the inlet compressors.  The processed gas is compressed using the 4th stage of the compressor for discharge"

The pipelines are known as the 6\" residue and the 10\" residue.  \n\nNatural gas liquids collected in the low temperature separator flow into a De-Ethanizer tower for further processing.  The De-Ethanizer is used to separate lighter hydrocarbons from the NGL liquid.  The lighter hydrocarbons combine with the process gas from the low temperature separator and either flow through the Tri-Ethylene Glycol (TEG) system or are directly routed back to the 4th stage of the inlet compressors.  The remaining NGL in the De-Ethanizer flow to storage tanks and is now known as Y-Grade.  Y-Grade is primarily: propane, butane, and natural gasoline.  Currently there are three (3) 90,000 gallon y-grade storage tanks.\n\nWater/Ethylene Glycol (EG) separated in the low temperature separator is routed to the dehydration still column and heated with hot oil to regenerate the EG.  The regenerated EG will be re-used in the injection process.  The vented stream from the still column consists primarily of water vapor and CO2, which is vented to a condenser system to recover liquid from the stream.  Non-condensable gas from the EG Vent stream is routed to flare.\n\nThe following process description includes the Fractionation Skid.   Y-Grade held in storage is pumped via Frac Feed Pumps into the Fractionation Skid. Y-Grade is separated into propane, butane and natural gasoline using two fractionation towers; the De-Propanizer and De-Butanizer.  The processed liquids are routed to a series of pressurized NGL storage tanks.  Currently, there are four (4) 90,000 gallon propane tanks, three (3) 90,000 gallon butane tanks.  The products are removed daily from the tanks by pressurized truck load out.  Tesoro Logistics also anticipates up to 130,000 gal/day of stabilized condensate (natural gasolines - RVP 12 psi) associated with the fractionation process.   Stabilized condensate (natural Gasoline) is comprised of C5+"
