      "SummaryText": "VeraSun Energy will operate an ethanol fuel production plant located Aurora, in Brookings County, South Dakota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, VeraSun Energy completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds for pentane and anhydrous ammonia and to cover general duty planning for less than 2,500 pounds of chlorine.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nVeraSun Energy is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as the anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.   The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Chlorine is used for water treatment of the cooling tower.  It is the policy of VeraSun Energy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including a significant quantity of a release of anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, or denaturant, it is the policy of VeraSun Energy to notify the Brookings/Aurora Police & Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and process by-products known as dry and wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,268,000 pounds (total pentane is 507,200 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel e"

      "SummaryText": "thanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 100,800 pounds.  Chlorine is used for treatment of cooling tower water.  Two one-ton tanks will be on-site with only one in use at a time (2,000 pounds).  One tank of chlorine is less than the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds) for this regulation, however for general duty planning purposes, it has been included.  VeraSun Energy has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to each of these reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  VeraSun Energy has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, VeraSun Energy has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nVeraSun Energy does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
