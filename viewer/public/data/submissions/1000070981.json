It is MRD's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility. As part of this policy, MRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at MRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP rule (40 CFR part 68). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at MRD. This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at MRD.\n\n\n\nOn August 1, 2017, MPC transferred ownership of certain logistics assets, including various storage tanks, unloading/loading operations, docks, and ancillary equipment at its petroleum refinery located in Detroit, Michigan (Detroit Refinery) to a separate operating company, Detroit Refining Logistics LLC (DRL). Both MPC and DRL are wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of MPC. Accordingly and consistent with EPA's RMP regulations, both the parent company and owner/operator of the RMP subject assets at the Detroit Refinery were updated to MPC to reflect that the logistics assets owned and operated by DRL and the refinery assets owned and operated by MPC remain a single stationary source for purposes of the RMPlan and that the RMPlan covers RMP affected assets owned by both DRL and MPC.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMRD has a long-stand"

One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery. MRD utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures to reduce the probability of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, the MRD has a well-trained emergency response team (ERT) to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The emergency response team is an industrial fire brigade fully trained for firefighting, hazardous material releases and spill response. A dedicated air monitoring team (AMT) exists to provide perimeter and community air monitoring in the event of a release. MRD evaluates each situation, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, requests assistance from outside emergency responders including local fire departments to help control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of a release. In conjunction with the Wayne County and Detroit local emergency planning committees (LEPCs), the refinery has the ability to notify the local community through media broadcasting systems.\n\n\n\nThe Michigan Refining Division Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at MRD. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager. Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division's process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division's Environmental, Safety and Security Manager.

In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n1.2 Michigan Refining Division Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nMRD is a petroleum refinery and petroleum products facility located principally in Detroit, Michigan with a tank farm in Melvindale, Michigan and a marine terminal located on the Rouge River in Detroit, Michigan. MRD uses crude petroleum as its primary feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane. Many of these products are flammable mixtures with components that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in the refinery process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. MRD has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nMRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. MRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the refinery. We have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA.\n\n\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MRD.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in the operation manuals for each process unit. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating pro"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nMRD has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are led by a person trained in the HAZOP methodology utilizing a team comprised of individuals who have experience in operations, operations supervision, engineering, technical services, and mechanical integrity. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Hazards are also risk ranked to provide a basis for further management of these items.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The PHA Team has considered offsite effects of potential releases as part of all PHA updates completed after August, 1996. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nMRD maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by qualified operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the refinery operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MRD has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nMRD uses contractors to supplement its work force especially during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform MPC personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
