      "SummaryText": "A.  Describe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nSouthern Foods Group, LLC d/b/a Borden Dairy recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Company has a Plant Safety Program.  The primary objective of the Plant Safety Program is to achieve maximum efficiency and saftey performance.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in preventing the accidental releases of refrigerant and minimizing the impact of any release, the facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management program to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency Response programs have been reviewed as well.  The objectives of the PSM/RMP programs are to prevent accidental releases through use of good operating procedures and mechanical intregrity of the refrigeration system.  The Plant Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nBorden Dairy operates a milk processing facility where milk products, juice,and juice drinks are processed, packaged, sold and distributed from this facility.  An important part of the processing and handling involves the refrigeration system to provide cooling during processing and storage at the facility. \n\nThe refrigeration system is a closed loop system whereby the liquid refrigerant from the high pressure receiver is piped in special piping to refrigeration equipment used for cooling.

      "SummaryText": " During cooling, the pressure of the refrigerant is reduced so that the refrigerant can take away heat from the milk being cooled or the cold storage rooms being cooled.  The refrigerant returns in vapor form at a low pressure to the compressors where the vapors are compressed and piped to the condensers.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors in the lines.  From the condensers, the refrigerant flows by gravity back to the high pressure receiver, thus completing the loop.  The refrigerant is a non-corrosive material; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, lines or valves.  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compresssors.  All vessels containing the refrigerant are ASME pressure rated above the maximum operating pressure.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe program consists of the following elements:\n\na.  Employee Participation:  All maintenance employees participated in developing the Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and other elememts of the program.\nB.  Process Safety Information:  Piping and Instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been developed where all vessels, lines and valves are numbered on the drawings.  All valves (except small guage valves) are numbered using a yellow tag with the valve number written in black on the tag.  Information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the MSDS.\nC:  Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies with maintenance personnel participating were conducted using the What-if/Check list Technique to look at the system and indentify potential hazards.  The PHAs are maintained on a Dyadem's computer program for easy and accurate management.\nD.  Operating Procedures:  Written procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Although the "

Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\nF.  Contractors:  Contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the refrigeration system.\nG.  Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review will be completed for all new projects involving a change to the system to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, operating procedures developed, P&IDs developed, PHA completed, and construction has been completed according to the design specifications.\nH.  Mechanical Integrity:  Annual inspections of the refrigeration system including lines and valves by a team of management and hourly personnel.  Any recommendation are resolved promptly.\ni.  Hot Work Permits:  Procedures to be followed to ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning in any area other than one designated as hot work.\nJ.  Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nK.  Incident Investigation:  All incidents or near misses will be investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\nL.  Compliance Audits:  Audits will be conducted every three years to ascertain whether or not the program is in place and working properly.\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo incidents were identified for the facility in the previous five years.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to refrigerant spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Tusla Fire Depart"
