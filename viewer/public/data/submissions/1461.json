The Indian River County Emergency Services Division will be conducting release drills on a biannual basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nPeriodic reviews and evaluations by plant staff and engineers insure up to date procedures and equipment. Currently, Indian River County Utility Services is conducting a feasibility study to determine the possible use of an alternate form of water disinfection."

      "SummaryText": "In this water treatment facility we handle chlorine, considered a hazardous chemical by the environmental Protection Agency. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary exposure, reduce the threat to the community and co-workers. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, safety devices in the design of the facility, safe handling procedures and training of personnel\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the facility's chlorine standard operating procedures, emergency procedures and the Indian River County Emergency Plan for Hazardous materials. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of the potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide potable water to the surrounding community. Chlorine gas is used during the treatment process to disinfect the water. Chlorine is delivered to the plant by semi truck and unloaded.  Plant operators then load the cylinders by stationary crane, the cylinder onto a scale. The cranes are tested and certified on an annual basis. Plant personnel are the only authorized people to enter this area. The facility currently has an inventory of 24,000 lbs. of chlorine.\n\nWorst case release scenario.\nThe worst case of a chlorine leak would be a complete failure of a 1-ton cylinder. The release would be the entire contents or 2,000 lbs. in a ten minute period.  It is assumed that all chlorine released would be in a gaseous form.\n\nThe alternate release scenario\nThe alternate release scenario is one in which a more likely type of failure could occur. For this facility it would involve a vacuum line break.\n\nAccidental Release prevention program.\nThis wate"
