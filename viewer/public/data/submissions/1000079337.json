The purpose of the Process Hazard Analysis and the methods to be used were discussed.  Prior to starting the actual PHA of the acetylene storage process, the team reviewed all process safety information.  Additionally a review of human factors with respect to the covered process and facility siting factors were considered.  Members of the HAZOP Team were selected on the basis of those who might offer the most experiences and resources to conduct an accurate analysis of the process.  The PHA was conducted the July 18, 2017."
