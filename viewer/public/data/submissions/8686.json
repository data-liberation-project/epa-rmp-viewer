This has been a very effective program.  We have been inspected by various Government units, and are working very hard to replace, repair, and generally get into complete compliance.  Our employees have had extensive training both on the job and in the classroom in safe operating procedures.  We are a very small company with 5 employees, which 3 have been with us for 11 years.  We are proud to say that in the 11 years that I have been with this company we have had no accidents with the Anhydrous Ammonia, either by employees or the customer.  We have a onsite training in Anhydrous Ammonia safety for our local Fire Department volunteers."
