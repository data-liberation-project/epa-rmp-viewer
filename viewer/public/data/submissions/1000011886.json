The Santa Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the employees, surrounding community, and the environment.  The Facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n  \nThe Santa Maria Facility processes crude oil into intermediate products for further processing at other locations to produce gasoline and diesel.  The Facility receives crude oil from many sources via pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and processes the crude oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, and truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into four products: gas oil, naphtha (pressure distillate), sulfur, and coke (solid carbon based material).  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce gasoline.  The gas oil and naphtha products are also stored in the Facility's Storage Tanks prior to shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and solid coke are shipped offsite by truck or railcar.  The Facility also has the utility and support systems required to provide for safe operation of the plant, including a power generation facility to make use of gas generated in the Refining Process.\n    \nThe RMP effort at the Facility was divided into three phases.
