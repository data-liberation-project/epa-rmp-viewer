              "Description": "The Conroe Plant consists of several co-located and interconnected production units that share loading/unloading, transfer, and storage facilities.  \n\n\n\nThe Alkylmorpholine Unit (AMU) is a continuous process where hydrogen, alcohol and morpholine are reacted to form morpholine product.  The AMU consists of a feed preparation system, reaction system, hydrogen removal system, alcohol removal system and purification system.\n\n\n\nSAU/AAU Units are continuous processes where raw materials are reacted to form specialty amines and alkanolamines.  The SAU Unit consists of a feed system, a reactor system, intermediate product storage, hydrogen removal, ammonia removal, lights removal and purification.  The AAU Unit consists of feedstock storage, reactor section, distillation section, process vent section and product storage.\n\n\n\nThe Carbonates Unit takes in oxide, carbon dioxide and catalyst to produce carbonate product.  The Carbonates Unit consists of a reaction system and evaporator system.  The reaction system is where the catalyst, oxide and carbon dioxide combine.  The evaporator system is where the crude carbonate is purified.\n\n\n\nJAU  I, II, III Units are continuous processes where raw materials are reacted to form amine products.  The Units consist of a reactor feed section, a reactor section, a hydrogen recovery section, an ammonia recovery section and a purification section.\n\n\n\nThe Kettles Units consist of batch processes where an initiator, catalyst and oxide are converted to product.  The Kettles Units consists of a reactor, neutralizer and filtration system.\n\n\n\nThere are three main loading/unloading areas within the plant: W-E-1 (rail car loading and unloading), W-E-2 (tank truck unloading and unloading), and W-E-3 (rail car unloading).",

Additionally, during a recent internal audit, it was discovered that the overall structure of this plan was incorrect.  Only one program level can apply to a process, and the previous version had one process with multiple programs (although all listed as Program Level 3).  The content is the same, there are no new covered processes, but the previous several programs have all been combined under one to better match the intent of the regulation.  The plan is now simply one \"process\" (consisting of several co-located and interconnected units) with one \"program level\".  Clarification has also been added to the program description to include major unloading/loading areas, which have always been considered part of the covered process, but not explicitly identified in previous submissions.  Maximum intended inventories have been updated, but the adjustments did not impact any worst case or alternate case scenarios.\n\n \n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the processes and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.

      "SummaryText": " pertaining to:\n\nHazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\nThe technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\nEquipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nHuntsman's Conroe Site Plant has performed a process hazard analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The Conroe Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Conroe Site assigns employees to the HAZOP teams who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific processes.  The HAZOP teams develop recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Conroe Plant completes a PHA Revalidation for each covered process every 5-years (or less) meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nHuntsman Conroe Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and/or revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nHuntsman Conroe Plant provides ini"

The training emphas safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHuntsman Conroe Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nHuntsman Conroe Plant has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedure assures that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\nHuntsman Conroe Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in pla"

Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nHuntsman Conroe Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Conroe Plant establishes an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.
