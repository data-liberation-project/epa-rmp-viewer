If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Saline County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Faclility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilize product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3.  Accidental Release prevention Program.  This facility follows the provisions of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.

There have been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammoina during the past five years that have not caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site  deaths,  evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facilty, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no specific safety  recommendations regarding the storage or the"
