These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations.

Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n2.   Valves (both manual and automatic) to permit isolation of the process.\n3.

      "SummaryText": "BRIDGEPORT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\nand contain the release.\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant, located 3= miles west of Bridgeport, Texas, operates a variety of\nprocesses to produce pipeline quality natural gas and natural gas liquids (such as ethane, propane\nand butane). The processes used include glycol dehydration, amine sweetening to remove CO2,\npropane refrigeration, fractionation, cryogenic processing and related utilities. Some of the\nchemicals produced or used include methane, ethane, propane, butane, triethylene glycol and\ndiethanolamine.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nNo H2S is stored, used or processed at the facility. There are no toxic chemicals stored at the\nBridgeport gas plant above the EPA Threshold Quantity. The threshold quantity is the level set by\nEPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if stored at the site requires compliance with the\nEPA's Risk Management Program regulations. Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include methane, ethane, propane and\nbutane. The worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the 75,000 gallon storage tank containing\npropane. Based on EPA analysis, the distance away from the plant affected in this wors"

      "SummaryText": "t-case\nscenario would be approximately 0.55 miles. \n\nA more probable release scenario would involve the release of propane from a transfer line during\nloading operations. Based on loading a truck in one hour, we would release approximately 1500\ngallons in 10 minutes, at which time our operators would detect and isolate the line or gas\ndetection would shut down the plant. The affected distance based on EPA guidance is\napproximately 0.15 miles, or approximately 790 feet. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based\non the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain\nsafe operation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all\nchemicals on-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all\nvessels and equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with\nwritten procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure\nthat safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated\nwith the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined\nto identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\nHAZOP analysis technique and the what-if/checklist methods are used to perform these\nevaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance,\nengineering and safety experience. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as\nw"

      "SummaryText": "is in place to\nprotect worker and public safety. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release,\nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition,\nthe Bridgeport gas plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of\nemergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency\nresponse equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their\nspecific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary,\nbased on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Bridgeport gas plant is coordinated with the\nlocal emergency response organizations and the emergency planning committee. This coordination\nprovides a means to notify the public in case of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating\nquick response to an incident. The Bridgeport facility recently had a simulated emergency drill,\nwith participation from the local emergency planning coordinator of the county and numerous\nlocal response agencies. Not only did we learn more about their capability, but they became more\nfamiliar with our operations and how to respond in case of an incident.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Bridgeport gas plant has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility\ncontinually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. The\nfollowing changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit and the\nsimulated emergency drill findings:\n\n     Upgraded control system to use distributed computerized contro"
