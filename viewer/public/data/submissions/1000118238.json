      "SummaryText": "1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nMcCain Foods USA in Plover, WI takes many precautions to prevent and/or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include equipment safety controls, such as the automatic refrigeration control system, pressure and temperature monitoring systems, pressure control devices, alarm notification systems, and automatic shutdown systems which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel. All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. The facility utilizes multiple safety control systems, such as  ammonia detection systems, alarm notification systems, automatic ventilation systems, automatic shutdown devices, and manually activated ventilation and shutdown switches to minimize the consequences of an unintended chemical release and prevent a catastrophic incident. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\nThe McCain Foods USA, Plover, Wisconsin plant is a food manufacturing facility that makes frozen potato products. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for food processing and preservation. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, an integrated safety management program has been established to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, sho"

The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n- Employee Participation Program\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training Program\n- Contractor Safety Program\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n- Emergency Planning and Response\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\nThe Plover facility has an emergency action plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that activate notification alarms to a monitored location if ammonia is detected. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing equipment specific isolation valves. Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system. McCain Foods emergency plans are coordinated with the Plover, WI Fire and Police Departments and Portage County Emergency Management through an off-site emergency plan, on-site tours, and discussions. In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Plover Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be mad"

Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). The facility emergency action plan includes procedures for handling small releases. The facility refrigeration technicians are trained how to respond to ammonia releases up to 300 ppm. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. Coordination with the local fire department and outside emergency responders is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nMcCain Foods expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of its PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  McCain Foods expects to evaluate each PHA and compliance audit recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release. \nThe facility has recently performed a table-top exercise with the local emergency responders and LEPC. During this exercise it was discussed to do a full response exercise in the near future (2025 or 2026) as time and schedules permit. \nThe facility is in the process of hiring a compliance specialist to assist with ensuring the PSM and RMP standards are properly maintained and implement recommended improvements as identified. \nThe facility has recently installed a new facility-wide annunciation system to provide ammonia related alarm notification. \nThe facility is currently working to update the ammonia refrigeration pressure relief design"
