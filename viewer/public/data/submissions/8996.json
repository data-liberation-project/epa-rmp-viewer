The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via barge, truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees, and visitors is controlled by fencing and security checkpoints.  One of the chemicals utilized in the corn milling process at the Memphis facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.   The Process department stores and maintains sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is present at or above threshold amounts for regulated substances. The Process Department contains the only process at the facility that is subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.  \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \"significant\" release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). The Cargill Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this Cargill facility under 40 CFR Part 68.

      "SummaryText": "ent\n\nThe corn milling process at the Cargill Memphis facility is designed to extract useable starch and sugars from corn kernels in order to produce various end-products. The first step in the corn milling process involves steeping the corn kernels in water tanks, into which vaporized SO2 is injected. The SO2 and water form a dilute solution of sulfurous acid that helps to soften the kernel, breakdown proteins and remove soluble constituents. The steeped corn then travels through degerminating mills and separation processes designed to remove the germ and separate out the starch from the gluten.  The starch slurry is then rinsed in water into which additional vaporized SO2 is injected.  This starch slurry is utilized in the production of corn syrup and starch.  \n\nThe Process Department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is utilized in the corn milling process. The SO2 is stored in an exterior storage tank as a pure liquefied gas at ambient temperatures.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 25,300 gallons.  Administrative controls prevent more than 21,500 gallons (262,300 lbs) from being stored in the tank at any time.  The storage tank is filled approximately every two weeks via 90-ton railcar.  \n\n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst-cases\" defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believ"

The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case, and alternative cases, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For toxic gases such as SO2 stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified \"toxic endpoints\", is considered the worst-case release for each facility. Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established \"toxic endpoints\" for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n\"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Con"

      "SummaryText": "sequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG) lists a number of refined dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  Sulfur dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than the ambient air.  Therefore, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such cases, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  The Dense Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1) was developed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to model dense gas releases and its use has been approved by the U.S. EPA.  The model is used to predict the dispersion of dense gases from ground level releases over flat, level terrain.  For these reasons, DEGADIS was used to model the worst-case release scenarios.\n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG provides a basic approach to estimating endpoint distances based on an ambient air temperature of 770F.  However, the RMP rule requires that if dispersion techniques other than the OCAG are applied, the maximum daily temperature over the last three years be used.  A review of National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) climatological data for the National Weather Service reporting station at Memphis, TN, indicated a recorded high temperature over the least three years of 1020F. \n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies \"surface roughness\" as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to \"toxic endpoint\". The surface roughness used in determining the distance to \"toxic endpoint\" should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural"

For modeling purposes, an \"urban\" surface roughness value of 50 cm, which is consistent with the urban and mixed land use of the surrounding area, was utilized.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of two years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Memphis, TN indicates that these dispersion conditions occur approximately 9% of the time (or about 2 hours per day, on average). The most predominant directions of transport are to the north. \n\nThe \"toxic endpoint\" for SO2 is 0.0078 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the \"worst-case\" SO2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, the regulated process at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility is subject to Program 3 requirements. \n\n3.1.1 Worst-Case Release: Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Memphis facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 262,300 lbs of stored SO2, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  The modeling results indicated the worst-case SO2 release would result in a distance to \"toxic endpoint\" of 9.8 miles.  The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 370,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Memphis area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas.

The closest environmental receptor is the Fuller State Park.  \n\nCargill notes that it is impossible to release 262,300 lbs of SO2 in 10 minutes because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid SO2 would not be available.  Even if the storage tank were to breach, liquid SO2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  However, Cargill evaluated this 10 minute release to comply with the noted regulation.\n\n3.2 Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors. In accordance with the EPA's OCAG, a single alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated substance. \n\nCargill performed a thorough review of the Process Department utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts. Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Cargill has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest \"toxic endpoint\" distance for each r"

The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Memphis, TN, confirmed that conditions of D stability and wind speeds of 3 m/sec and greater are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.  Alternative dispersion modeling was conducted using EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG).\n\n\n3.2.1 Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe alternative SO2 release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break in the SO2 unloading assembly at the delivery railcar. A break of this type would result in a hole in the unloading assembly of approximately 1.0 inches in diameter.  The pressurized release of SO2 through hole of this size would result in two-phase flow (vapor and liquid) as the pressurized SO2 flashed to the vapor state.  The modeling showed that SO2 would be released at a rate of 1600 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the sulfur dioxide would then be dispersed as a heavy gas and the excess flow valve on the railcar would not engage.  Cargill has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of SO2, resulting in a total release of 48,000 lbs.  This alternative SO2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the \"worst-case\".  \n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG indicates that under 'urban' conditions, the distance to \"toxic endpoint\" would be 0.6 miles."

The incident information is reviewed and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are notified.\n\nDuring the past 5 years (June 1994 to June 1999), there has been no accident involving any RMP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This means that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment.\n\n\n\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\nCargill's Memphis plant has established an Emergency Action Plan that is designed to address foreseeable emergency situations at t"

Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb threat, weather emergencies and other natural emergencies.  Due to the ongoing risks that are presented by weather emergencies, the plant has in place an emergency plan to protect both the plant operational integrity and the safety of its workers and neighbors from weather emergencies.  In regards to chemical releases, Cargill has developed a command structure and specific procedures that must be adhered to in the unlikely event of a chemical emergency.  These procedures define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying the appropriate emergency response staff of potential emergency events. If a chemical release is detected on-site, the emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of response is determined by the Incident Commander, with support from available emergency response (HAZ-MAT) teams and technical advisory staff.  Each Department in the facility must also follow a specific Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control Plan in the event of a chemical release. \n\nPlant operations at the Memphis facility can present various types of potential hazards and Cargill recognizes the need to have a well trained and prepared work force to safely and effectively deal with any emergency situation.  The Cargill Memphis facility provides training of responsible staff and the exercise of important communication links with the community, in order to maintain an appropriate state of readiness for emergency situations.

Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are documented so that information about the safe handling of chemicals present at the facility is available to all employees, and can be interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Incident Commander. This is especially important when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at the Memphis plant lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even safer tomorrow.\n\nCargill Memphis' safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of on-going evaluations of in-plant safety and program effectiveness.  \n\n\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\tJune, 1999"
