To strive for a coordinated and affective program, particular individuals have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element. However, there is a single person identified who has overall responsibility for the PSM and RMP. Program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements. The entire program is scheduled to be reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review. A follow-up report of the audit is created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements. A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years. A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from the hazard analysis are addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. It is Enfield Farms, Inc. intent that the PSM/RMP for the facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment. It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental releases of ammonia will occur due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear.\n\nThis facility is used for processing IQF raspberries and blueberries. \n\n\n\nRelease Considerations\n\nFollowing program guidelines a \"Worse Case\" release of ammonia was analyzed. Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered. Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report. The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in the \"Process H"

      "SummaryText": "azard Analysis\" of the system and facility. The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThis system has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five-year period. If an actual release occurs (or even a near miss), an incident investigation is done to determine the cause and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nEnfield Farms, Inc. has a written \"Emergency Action Plan\" that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release. Company personnel have been trained in notification and evacuation procedures. The refrigeration operators will perform only \"defensive\" actions to control and contain an ammonia release without endangering themselves. Enfield Farms, Inc. has also coordinated with the Whatcom County LEPC and with the local emergency responders (Lynden Fire Department).\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n\nEnfield Farms, Inc. holds quarterly safety committee meetings with all management staff, lead personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment. There is also a weekly staff meeting for all staff supervisors. Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon. Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated; in many cases annually, to assure that all operations are being done in a safe and effective manner and operating procedure will continue to be developed and improved.\n\n"
