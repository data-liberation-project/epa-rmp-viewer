Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Youngstown Grape Distributors has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Youngstown Grape Distributors, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Youngstown Grape Distributors has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical         | Process Quantity (lbs.)\n\nEast System              Anhydrous Ammonia          16,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. \n\n\n\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regul"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nYoungstown Grape Distributors is a packing and cold storage facility for various varieties of tree fruit and grapes.  The facility has one (1) RMP ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold storage rooms.  The rooms use evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  System safety devices provide substantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nThe East and West refrigeration systems utilize pumped liquid recirculators where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.  The system uses water to defrost the coils.\n\n\n\nYoungstown Grape Distributors was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechani"

The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion system (North and West system) or to the atmosphere (East system) if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains valves to vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nYoungstown Grape Distributors has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processeses. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processeses at the Youngstown Grape Distributors facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The East System ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performin"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nYoungstown Grape Distributors has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Youngstown Grape Distributors continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Youngstown Grape Distributors ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Youngstown Grape Distributors management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nYoungstown Grape Distributors has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, "

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Youngstown Grape Distributors has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Youngstown Grape Distributors now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Youngstown Grape Distributors employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Youngstown Grape Distributors will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. "
