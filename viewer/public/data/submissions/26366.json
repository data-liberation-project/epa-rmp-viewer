THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT WOULD BE 1.1 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 700 AREA RESIDENTS. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WOULD HAVE A RUPTURE OF A TRANSFER HOSE, RELEASING 11,908 POUNDS AND HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .41 MILES AFFECTING NEARLY 350 CITIZENS.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS EMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF ANSIK-61, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 AS WELL AS THE KANSAS DEPT OF AGRICULTURE. THE STATE ENSPECTS OUR PLANT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN GENERAL SAFETY, THE HAZARDS OF AMMONIA, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES OF A TYPICAL FACILITY. THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR THE APPROPIATE GLOVES AND GOGGLES DURING LOADING OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ON HAND DURING NURSE TANK FILLING OPERATIONS. SINCE THIS FACILITY IS NEW IT IS  EASY TO REPORT THAT NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES HAVE OCCURED AT THIS LOCATION WITHIN THE LAST 5 YEARS. \n\nTHIS FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT.\n\nTHE OTTAWA COOP IS COMMITTED TO SAFETY. THERE ARE MANY HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH AMMONIA. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A PROPANE STORAGE TANK IN THE AREA OF THE AMMONIA PLANT, WE AT THIS TIME FEEL THAT IS POSES NO THREAT TO THE AMMONIA PLANT OR THE AMMONIA PLANT TO THE PROPANE STORAGE. WE REQUIRE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE THAT LOADS AMMONIA BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AT A STATE SPONSERED TRAINING SCHOOL AND YEARLY TRAINED IN OPERATING AND SAFETY PROCEED"
