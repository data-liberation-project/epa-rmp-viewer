The Southwest Water Treatment Plant stores chlorine in quantities in excess of the 2,500 pound Risk Management Program threshold.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR A? 68.150, the Southwest Water Treatment Plant is required to submit a single Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes the information required by A?A? 68.155 through 68.185.  The Southwest Water Treatment Plant is also required to provide an executive summary in the RMP.  The following is a brief description of various elements of the facility's Risk Management Program, as required by 40 CFR A? 68.155:\n\n(a)    THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) operate five water treatment plants in the Southeast Michigan area.  While the production of potable drinking water is vital to the welfare of the community, DWSD recognizes that the safe handling of the chlorine used in the water disinfection process is also critical to the welfare of the community.  DWSD recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nDWDS is committed to the implementation of stringent safety precautions for chlorine handling at all of its water treatment facilities.  These safety precautions are necessary to prevent accidental releases of chlorine that could threaten the health of DWSD employees, DWSD contractors, and the members of the community DWSD serves.  To this end, DWSD implements routine equipment maintenance and process improvements, operational procedures, employee training programs, and emergency response procedures, and is committed to compliance with all "

The plant typically produces 65 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated water.\n\nThe plant adds aluminum sulfate (alum) to the water to aid in the removal of particulate matter.  The alum produces a precipitate that binds to fine particles; the resulting larger particles settle out.  On an as-needed basis, the plant uses its carbon system to add activated carbon to the water.  Activated carbon can remove tastes and odors that may exist in the influent water.  The plant uses its fluoride system to add fluoride to the water.  The fluoride provides water consumers with protection against tooth decay.  The plant also adds phosphoric acid to the water to minimize the leaching of lead from water distribution piping.  The plant's alum, carbon, fluoride, and phosphoric acid systems do not contain chemicals that are designated as regulated toxic or flammable substances pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nWater disinfection using chlorine occurs at the beginning of the treatment process (pre-chlorination) and as a final treatment step (post-chlorination).  The primary components of the plant's chlorine system include a maximum of twenty eight (28) 2,000 pound containers of chlorine, two (2) evaporators, eight (8) chlorinators, and the associated chlorinated water distribution components (e.g., polyvinylchloride piping).  The facility is also equipped with a chlorine abatement system (scrubber) that is capable of neutralizing the contents of one (1) 2,000 pound container of chlorine.\n\nChlorine is designated as a regulated toxic substanceA? pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.  The Southwest Water Treatment Plant has more than the threshold quantity (2,500 pounds) of chlo"

The Southwest Water Treatment Plant has established a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM).  The information contained within this PSM Plan establishes the protocols needed to safely handle and use chlorine.  The plan is designed to prevent and minimize the effects of an unplanned, sudden or non-sudden incidents involving chlorine.  This plan is designed to meet the regulatory requirements of MIOSHA, Rule #40819102 Process Safety Management Program.\n\nSpecifically this plan protects the community using a combination of operating procedures and safe work practices, equipment design, emergency operations and shut-down procedures, building design, containment, chlorine scrubbing equipment, and employee training and education.\n\nThe requirements of the Process Safety Management Plan will be implemented as an on-going compliance policy to ensure that chlorine is safely stored, handled, and used by the Southwest Water Treatment Plant.  This plan provides direction for the current and future use and handling of chlorine, and ensures that any release of chlorine can be safely contained and neutralized so as to minimize its impact on the community.\n\n(d)    THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five (5) years at the Southwest Water Treatment Plant, there has been one(1) reportable release of chlorine or chlorine release that has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nA minimal quantity of chlorine was released during the incident.

The worker fully recovered from their injuries and returned to work. Training and operating procedures were reviewed and updated after the incident to reduce the likelihood of future incidents.\n\n(e)    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Southwest Water Treatment Plant has a documented Chlorine Emergency Response Plan.  The Southwest Water Treatment Plant is also included in an Emergency Response Plan that was developed for all Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) facilities.  The DWSD Emergency Reponses Plan has an appendix that specifically addresses accidental releases of chlorine.  The plans address the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, emergency first aid and medical treatment, response strategies and incident command, and specific procedures for responding to chlorine releases.\n\nSouthwest Water Treatment Plant personnel that have the potential for responding to accidental releases of chlorine have received formal emergency response training (e.g., 40-Hour HAZMAT training). In addition, the personnel receive 8 hour HAZMAT refresher training annually.  \n\nThe Southwest Water Treatment Plant is equipped with electronic chlorine detectors.  If the detector senses chlorine at a concentration of 1 part per million or greater, an audible alarm will sound and flashing red lights will be activated at the detector, dock, hallway adjacent to the chlorine storage room, chlorine storage room, and laboratory.  Three operators are on site at all times to respond to an alarm.  During off shifts, a fourth person is on call. The external notification of local emergency response agencies and the public would be conducted on an as-needed basis, in accordance with the facility's Emergency Response Plan.\n\nIn the event of a release, the Southwest Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a scrubber that is capable of neut"
