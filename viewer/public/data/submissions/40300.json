Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nCompleted in 2000, Sea-3 of Florida?s Tampa Terminal provides a vital energy service to homeowners, commercial businesses, and industry.  The facility has an excellent safety record and its employees are key players in achieving that safety record.\n\nSea-3 of Florida is committed to safe and reliable operation for the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment.  Sea-3 of Florida is proud of its operating record.  There has never been an incident that resulted in any offsite impacts to neighboring industries, residents or the community at large. This record has been achieved through consistent attention and total dedication by management and staff to safe operating practices and preventive maintenance.  Sea-3 of Florida continuously stays abreast of the latest technology and practices in operating and maintaining their Tampa Terminal.  These practices form the backbone of Sea-3's dedication to keeping the facility and the community safe.\n\n\n2. Description of the Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThe Sea-3 of Florida Tampa Terminal imports and stores fully refrigerated liquid propane (also called liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) at -45?F.  The terminal processes this product by heating it to +40?F for shipment to its customers by truck.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorizing agent, is added to the LPG distributed from the terminal.  Both propane and ethyl mercaptan are regulated flammable substances.  The terminal has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n\n3. Release Prevention Program\n\nThe terminal was designed and built in accordance with provisions of the following three recognized standards for LPG facilities:\n\n*  NFPA 58, Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases, (National Fire Protection Association).\n\n*  API 2510, Design and Construction of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Installations, (American Petroleum Institute).\n\n*  API 620, Design and Const"

Ultraviolet flame detectors are used to detect fires.  The plant is attended by at least two operators at all times.  They log field operating data at two-hour intervals and monitor plant equipment and operations using the following monitoring and control systems:\n\n*  The main control panel, located in the central control room, displays pressures, temperatures, valve positions, and flow rates and provides for remote operation and manual or automatic shutdown of valves and equipment.\n\n*  The emergency control panel, also located in the central control room, displays readings of combustible vapor detectors and fire detectors.  It provides fire department notification and manual and automatic activation of water deluge and emergency shutdown systems.\n\n*  A closed circuit television (CCTV) system, with displays located in the central control room, is used for surveillance and security of all portions of the terminal.\n\nWritten policies and procedures for safe operation are contained in the following Sea-3 of Florida manuals:\n\n*  \"Sea-3 of Florida Standard Operating Procedures Manual,\" covering normal startup, operation, and shutdown of plant systems and equipment.\n\n*  \"Sea-3 of Florida Safety Standards and Procedures Manual,\" covering safe handling of the product and other materials used in the plant.  It covers safe work practices and permitting requirements for such activities as hot work, electrical work, confined space and vessel entry, excavation, and other hazardous activities.

Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the four years since the plant began operating, there have been no propane or mercaptan releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nEmergency planning and preparedness are covered in the \"Sea-3 Contingency Plan,\" which details responses by facility employees, Hillsborough County Fire Rescue, Hillsborough Sheriff's Department, and the US Coast Guard.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 2000.  Safety reviews have been undertaken periodically since that time.  Many recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented through equipment and procedural changes.\n\nThe most recent review was a process hazard analysis (PHA) completed in March 2000.  All issues identified during that review were dealt with by the end of that year.  Sea-3 of Florida will update their PHA by March 2005 and will deal promptly with any recommendations for changes and improvements that result from that review."
