      "SummaryText": "Paulsboro Refinery Risk Management Plan - NJ\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, including fuels and lubricants, from raw crude oil. The refinery produces several regulated flammables; most are components of flammable mixture streams.  The refinery also produces hydrogen sulfide, which causes the removal of sulfur compounds from the refined products.  Three other regulated chemicals, hydrofluoric acid, ammonia and chlorine, are used in the refining processes.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the refinery is a failure of the toxic material storage drum, releasing its contents in ten minutes.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures were used when developing this hypothetical scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20-PPM (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this WCS was calculated and is reported in the tables.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario (ACS) for each toxic chemical (names listed in tables) was performed and consequence results are listed in the tables.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of th"

Using methods prescribed by the EPA, the entire tank inventory of material is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS was calculated and is reported in the tables.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures is allowed when developing this hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ACS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE, resulting from a leakage during handing of flammables mixtures, was performed and the consequence results are listed in the tables. The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this event was calculated and is reported in the tables.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Paulsboro Refinery.  Processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, as well as New Jersey chemical safety regulations.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  The refinery Joint Health, Safety and Environmental Committee facilitates much of the refinery safety communications. The refinery employee participation procedure outlines how employees participate for each process safety e"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address chemical safety concerns. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Standard Operating Procedures manuals.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., alarms, interlocks and automatic shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating, of equipment, etc.  The refinery also maintains process flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams along with plot plans and electrical classification drawings. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards as"

      "SummaryText": "sociated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Paulsboro Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a refe"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by reviewing them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nOperator Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Paulsboro Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees and unit transfers receive basic operator training in refinery operations related to the process to which they are being assigned.  After successfully completing this training, a newly assigned operator receives on the job training from a qualified operator to learn unit specific duties and tasks. Operators demonstrate required qualification requirements through written tests, demonstrative skills and oral testing.  Once the Unit Supervisor has reviewed the qualification of the Operator, their progress is documented and they are released to perform their job responsibilities.  There are additional qualified operators working at the process unit for operator support.  In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Operating procedure review and job rotation is performed every year.  Additional refresher testing, on all jobs for which an operator is qualified, is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force.

Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Paulsboro Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and those proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Paulsboro Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices"

In October 2001, there was a Hydrofluoric Acid containing Hydrocarbon stream release from the Alky unit. An operator became ill due to HF exposure.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Paulsboro Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Paulsboro Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.
