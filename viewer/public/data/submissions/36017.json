The base is \r\nowned and operated by the United States Air Force Air Combat \r\nCommand and is home for the 49th Fighter Wing.  The size of HAFB, \r\ncombined with its primary combat support mission and presence of base \r\nhousing for permanent party and temporary duty personnel, requires that \r\nthe base provide services and support an infrastructure similar to those \r\nthat may exist in a medium-size, non-military municipality.\r\nThe base operates a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for treating \r\nwastewater produced on-site.  The WWTP uses a mixture of chlorine gas \r\ndissolved in water for chlorinating plant effluent, influent, and an \r\nactivated sludge stream.  Chlorine, required to perform the chlorination \r\ntasks, is received and dispensed from standard one-ton chlorine \r\ncontainers that meet or exceed the U.S. Department of Transportation \r\nspecifications for design and testing.  The inventory of chlorine exceeds \r\nthe threshold of 2,500 pounds, specified in the Risk Management Program \r\nregulation, and therefore, triggers the submission of a Risk Management \r\nPlan (RMP) at least every five years.  This submission represents the first \r\nupdate or revision, of the original RMP that was prepared and submitted \r\nJune 1999.\r\n2.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the endpoint distances \r\nthat may result from a worst-case and alternative-case (i.e., more likely) \r\naccidental release of chlorine from a one-ton container and the human and \r\nenvironmental receptors within the impact area.  The results of the hazard \r\nassessment are included in attachments to this Executive Summary.  \r\nEndpoint distances were determined by applying the Environmental \r\nProtection Agency's recommended approach that is contained in their \r\nmost current guidance document"

The \r\nprogram employs a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process \r\nincluding process design, process technology, process changes, \r\noperational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine \r\nactivities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, \r\ntraining programs, and other interrelated elements that effect the WWTP \r\nchlorine system.\r\nThe various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design \r\nand operation of the WWTP system to prevent or mitigate a chlorine \r\nrelease are evaluated and strengthened through the prevention program \r\nto ensure their effectiveness.  The prevention program proactively \r\nidentifies, evaluates, and mitigates chlorine releases that could occur as a \r\nresult of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment. Some of the key \r\ncomponents of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n?\tThe development, documentation, and operator availability of \r\ncritical process safety information regarding the hazards of chlorine \r\nand the design of the system and equipment.
