      "SummaryText": "At BASF Corporation's Hannibal Plant, we manufacture several agricultural products.  At this plant, we are very concerned with protecting our employees and our environment. We are also concerned with protecting our families that live in nearby communities.  We have designed our facilities to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facilities. It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations.  We have developed and implemented the following to help achieve our goals:\n \n* State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\n* Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\n* An extensive safety, health and process safety management system\n* Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\n* An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\n* Plant site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\n\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the plant's policy to maintain an up-to-date emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The plant works closely with area community emergency response agencies providing them with information on plant operations and response programs in addition to conducting periodic training with members of the local emergency response agencies.\n\nBASF's Hannibal facility has seven substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.

All of these are used as raw materials to produce agricultural products.\n\nLiquid, anhydrous ammonia is received by tank truck (approximately 26,000 pounds per truck) and is stored in a single steel tank at ambient temperature and under its own vapor pressure. This tank is located within a concrete secondary containment system.  The tank is equipped with overpressure protection and is rated to withstand full vacuum. The total ammonia inventory is 41,000 pounds. This includes the amount in the storage tank and associated piping that handle anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling system consists of an unloading station with secondary containment system,  storage tank, two pumps and piping.  As for all operations at this facility, this system is governed by well-established operating procedures.\n\nBromine, a liquid, is shipped to the plant by tank truck (about 44,000 pounds per truck). During unloading, the truck is stationed in a containment area designed to hold 110% of the truck's contents. Bromine is unloaded via top unloading system into its storage tank. A unique tank truck and unloading station are used to ensure that only the correct raw material is unloaded into the storage tank. The storage and handling system design minimizes potential leaks by eliminating all tank bottom nozzles and by using the latest control devices.\n\nThe bromine storage tank is housed in a diked area. It is pumped to the chemical processing equipment to make the agricultural products. All fumes from the unloading operation, the storage tank and the chemical processing steps are destroyed by a scrubber. The  total plant inventory is about 100,000 pounds. This total includes the maximum allowable bromine in the storage tank and the amount in the chemical process.\n\nEthyl mercaptan is typically received by railroad tank car (abo"

The maximum total inventory for the eight tank cars is 1,100,000 pounds.  When needed, a tank car is moved to the unloading area using a Trackmobile operated by trained, plant personnel.  The railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and is then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload. Ethyl mercaptan may also be received by tank truck in quantities of approximately 5,000 gallons.  Trucks are also unloaded in concrete secondary containment systems provided for unloading.\n\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system. The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product. The total inventory for the storage tank, chemical processing equipment and pipes is about 330,000 pounds. Transportation, unloading, and use of mercaptan are managed under plant operating procedures.  \n\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl)  is shipped to the plant in cylinders. Each cylinder contains 600 pounds of liquified HCl under its own vapor pressure. A maximum of sixteen cylinders is allowed on the plant site at any one time. A maximum of four cylinders are located near the HCl dispensing system which is designed to handle one cylinder at at time. The total plant inventory (cylinders plus chemical process) of hydrogen chloride is about 11,000 pounds.\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride and phosphorus trichloride are also transported to the plant via tank truck.

(Active mitigation systems were not considered according to EPA guidelines for worst cases.) Although the storage tank is designed to store approximately 110,000 pounds, plant administrative controls limit the amount to 95,000 pounds.  For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire tank contents (at 100 degrees F) are released to the secondary containment area (diked area). The distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint (0.0065 mg/liter) is 11 miles.

The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint was estimated to be 0.8 miles using RMP*Comp (tm) version 1.06.\n\nAlternative scenarios - bromine (Br2), phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) & phosphorus trichloride (PCl3): The same release scenario was assumed for each of these materials. It was assumed that while unloading a tank truck, the unloading hose fails due to the movement of the tank truck due to improper job set up. It was assumed that the emergency stop system was not activated immediately and the release was permitted to continue for ten minutes. It was also assumed that a continuously evaporating pool form in the diked area. The distances to the toxic endpoint were estimated using RMP*Comp (tm) version 1.06.

It was further assumed that the total inventory (1,100,000 pounds) is vaporized and undergoes a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to an EPA endpoint of 1 psi overpressure was estimated to be 0.7 miles using RMP*Comp (tm).\n\nAlternative scenario - ethyl mercaptan: For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that a fully loaded tank car is derailed and rolls over.  It was further assumed that manway on the railcar was improperly secured. The manway fails releasing the entire tank car load of ethyl mercaptan (140,000 pounds). It was also assumed that ethyl mercaptan forms a pool that is ignited forming a pool fire.
