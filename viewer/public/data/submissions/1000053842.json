Winfield Solutions, LLC owned and governed by Land O'Lakes, Inc. \n\n\n\nThe St.Joseph Omnium facility is located on approximately 56 acres in the southern industrial area of St.Joseph, MO.  Nearly 20 acres are developed with the remaining area leased to a local farmer for the purpose of growing crops.  The facility formulates and packages crop protection products used to grow crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families throughout the world.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases, especially hazardous materials.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this plant, the safety of its employees and safety of the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, Omnium is committed the following:\n\nA knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n\nA well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n\nImprovements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n\nExcellence in safety programs and practices, and an outstanding safety and accident record\n\nPreparation and training for emergency response.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy\n\nOmnium has a written Emergency Response Plan, as required by RMP and other EPA and OSHA rules, and is committed to respond to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the LEPC and emergency response agencies.  Omnium personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the facility.  In addition, employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and poss"

      "SummaryText": "ible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nCurrently Three listed chemicals are kept at the facility.\n\nAqua Ammonia is a toxic substances, regulated by EPA's RMP rule, that is stored and used at the Omnium facility.  \n\nAqua Ammonia solution, at 30% ammonia or less, is a liquid stored in pressure vessel designed for this purpose and is kept under a nitrogen blanket for the suppression of ammonia vapors.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Isopropylamine in a 70% solution is stored and utilized in a process.  This is a flammable substance and is listed in Table 3 of Section 68.130 List of Substances.  This liquid is stored in a pressure vessel designed for this purpose and also maintained under a nitrogen gas blanket for suppression of flammable vapors.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Dimethylamine is stored and utilized in a process.  This is a flammable substance listed in Table 3 as well.  This liquid is stored in a pressure vessel designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure without taking into account active mitigation controls.  The release distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to the public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a AA?public danger zone.AA?  Possible causes of the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nOmnium's hypothetical worst-case scenario regarding a toxic substance involves a 115,558 pound Aqua Ammonia release from a Storage vessel.  The worst-case assumes, as required by RMP, that the entire contents of the vessel are released"

This worst-case scenario has off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release: however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\n\n\nIn the facility's hypothetical alternative release scenario for Aqua Ammonia (a toxic substance), a flange leak for a duration of one hour results in a 1 inch puddle of Aqua Ammonia solution covering 40 square feet of the floor of the secondary containment area around the storage vessel.  This alternative release scenario has no off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nOmnium's hypothetical worst-case scenario regarding a flammable substance involves a release and instantaneous ignition of 36,500 gallons of 70% Isopropylamine.  This worst-case scenario has off-site consequences up to 759 yards from the point of origin.\n\n\n\nIn the facility's hypothetical alternative release scenario for Isopropylamine (a flammable substance), a flange leak for a duration of one hour results in a 345 pounds of material escaping.  The threat zone is measure at 13 yards from the source for this scenario.  There is no resulting off-site impact.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOmnium is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Elements of the PSM rule are included in the Program 3 Prevention Program under EPAAA?s RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, or process hazardous chemicals.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of facility operations.\n\n\n\nOmnium adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention"

      "SummaryText": " Program requirements.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in the programs throughout its years of operation.\n\n\n\nDue to the variety of substances Omnium handles in the normal course of doing business, several separate spill prevention programs and operating procedures are in place as an effort to reduce the risk or consequence of an accidental release.  A section in the plant's Emergency Response Manual is devoted to general chemical spill prevention while a separate program is in effect for preventing spills of petroleum products.\n\n\n\nSafety showers and eye washes are readily available\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires inclusion of the facility's five-year accident history for all accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant proper or environmental damage on or off site.\n\nWe have had one accidental release of dimethylamine in the past five years.  Less than 1 pound, under pressure, was released and resulted in one employee injury.  There were no offsite consequences.\n\nIn addition, an accidental release of less than 1 pound of Methyl Mercaptan for several seconds resulted in on employee injury.  Methyl Mercaptan has now been evacuated from the facility and is no longer being stored or utilized at the facility in any fashion.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOmnium's emergency response plan is designed to prevent individual injuries, damage to the environment, and damage to property, both on site and off site.  The plan is also to be used as a guide in coordinating activites with police and fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and state and local response teams.  As part of this summary, a general overview of Omnium's Emergency Response Plan (the Plan) follows.\n\nThe plan consists of 12 sections: table of contents, several lists of relevant telephone numbers, specific guidelines and procedures regarding fire, human rescue, spill or release, sever weather, evacuat"
