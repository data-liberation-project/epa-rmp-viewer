The tanks are located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A facility provided SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of one of the denaturant tanks, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.5-mile radius.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth. An un-named tributary to Cowskin Creek and Colwich Memorial Park Pond would be affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\nAlternative Scenario:\n1.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to end point; the model results were 0.1 miles. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Population data was unavailable for a radius of 0.1 miles so 0.2 miles was used instead. Public receptor information ("

The new facility began operating in August 2019. ELEMENT is updating the existing RMP for their operations.\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\nELEMENT has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nELEMENT has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nELEMENT's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe ELEMENT ethanol plant is located in Colwich, Sedgwick County, Kansas. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\nWORS CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n1.
