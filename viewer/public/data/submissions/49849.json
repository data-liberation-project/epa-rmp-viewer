Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of AgVantage FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  Miles  Fire Department,    \nJackson County  Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.      The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at,  Miles   is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \nhandling system consists of storage tanks, loading risers associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 460,000              \npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.      The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4.      The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 "

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n5.      Historical information on this facility.\n\nThere have been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years, with a release of 17,400 pounds.  The release was contained to our property and offsite property or people were involved.\n\n6.      The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility has:\n\n-A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,\n 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n             \n          In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify Miles  Fire Department and Jackson County  LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated                 \nwith both  the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance \nof safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
