The combination of the Company's herbicides, seeds and related genetic trait products provides growers with integrated solutions to more efficiently and cost-effectively produces crops at higher yields, while controlling weeds, insects and diseases. We are committed to pursuing these goals in sustainable ways that meet people's needs without compromising future generation's ability to meet their needs.\n\n\n\nOne of the locations contributing to this vision is Monsanto's Luling manufacturing plant, located at 12501 River Road in Luling, Louisiana. This facility manufactures Roundup brand herbicide and ACL brand active chlorine. As part of operations, the facility handles sufficient quantities of chlorine, formaldehyde, phosphorus trichloride and isopropylamine to require compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.\n\n\n\nThe major elements of the RMP prevention program are very similar to OSHA's PSM regulation. OSHA has audited our facility under their Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and has awarded their highest rating -\"Star\" to Monsanto Luling Plant three times. Receiving of these awards demonstrates our commitment to the safety and health of employees and the surrounding community as well as protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nOur location has a documented Emergency Response plan which includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events, including inclement weather, fire and toxic chemical releases.  There are personnel responsible for implementation of this procedure on site at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. "
