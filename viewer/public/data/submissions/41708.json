Ross manufactures infant formula and adult medical nutritutional products.  None of the materials used in the manufacture or packaging of these food products are considered to be regulated substances under Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  The sole regulated chemical at the facility is ammonia, used in a refrigeration system.  All Federal requirements of  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program and U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program are adhered to.   The Ross Products facility operates a single, closed loop ammonia system.  All of the ammonia handling equipment and piping, except for the ice makers (2), condensers (2) and associated piping are located in the site's Energy Center Ammonia Room.  The ammonia system is used to chill water to 33-38 degrees F.  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool equipment and product storage tanks.  At no time does the ammonia come in contact with the water.  A description of the ammonia refrigeration process is included in Section 7, under the \"Prevention Program Description.\"  There have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  This may be attributed to the facility's accidental release prevention program that combines the newest equipment technologies with detailed operational procedures, preventive maintenance procedures, training and sound ammonia system management practices. In-plant emergency response procedures have been developed that incorporate both Abbott resources and emergency response services available within Casa Grande and Pinal County.  The site maintains a highly trained workforce that is extremenly  familiar with the ammonia system and able to respond to any contingency.  The site's Emergency Response Team (ERT) is available on all three shifts, and is trained to OSHA's \"Hazardous Materials Technician\" level.  The ERT is also train"

Energy Center operators are also trained in ammonia emergency response and assist the ERT with any situation that may arise.  Implementation and maintenance of systems and programs discussed in this report have the full support of Abbott management.  Abbott has a global environmental, health, and safety policy that applies to all Abbott locations worldwide.  The policy explicilty requires all locations to\"?maintain a safe and healthy workplace and environment; 'and,'?comply with all applicable laws?designed to protect human health, safety and the environment.\"  The site's general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: 1) High level of training for Energy Center Operators, 2) Preventive Maintenance Program, 3) State-of-the-art process and safety equipment, 4) Accurately written operating procedures, written with the participation of  employees, 5) Regular hazard reviews of equipment and procedures, and 6) Ongoing auditing and inspection program.  Ammonia specific exposure prevention steps include: the availability of self-contained breathing apparatuses for operators and emergency responders; controlled access to the ammonia room; ammonia detectors; computerized process control with graphics; and a Process Safety Management program.   To ensure continuing proper operation, each piece of ammonia equipment is monitored through the preventive maintenance (PM) program.  The PMs are generated automatically from a computer database at set intervals (daily to annually).  Equipment is inspected and/or serviced during these scheduled PMs. Equipment condition and the work performed is documented.  Annually, a certified contractor performs a complete inspection of each compressor.  Instrument Maintenance perform PMs on alarms and control systems.

All safety valves are piped in to a common relief piping system that has both a rupture disk and an ammonia detector in the piping at the discharge point.  The detector is tied in to the site's monitoring system and will sound an alarm at 35 ppm.  All safety relief valves are replaced every five years.  There have been no major changes since the implementation of the PSM Program.  However, there have been some minor changes which were documented by the \"management of change\" procedures of the PSM program.  Process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted in April of 1999 and April of 2004.  The most recent recommendations are currently under review and an action plan is being developed.  Abbott is proud of it's overall safety and environmental compliance records.  Our careful operation of the ammonia system is an integral part of safety and spill prevention planning."
