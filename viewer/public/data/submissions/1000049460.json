This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management acitivities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\r\n* The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\r\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nOur facility produces chlorinated dry bleaches which are used extensively as sanitizers and disinfectants in detergents, cleansers, water treatment, and swimming pool and spa water treatment. The manufacture of our products utilizes a variety of chemicals and processing operations. One of our primary raw materials is chlorine, which EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. Chlorine is the only chemical at the Clearon Corp that is classified as a hazardous chemical. Manufacturing Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios:\r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenario:\r\nOur worst-case accident scenario involving chlorine would occur in the highly improbable event that the walls of a full 90-ton railroad tank car catastrophically fail, releasing the entire liquid chlorine contents within 10 minutes.  According to EPA's RMP*COMP program, the distance to the endpoint of the cloud is 14 miles.  \r\n\r\nAlternate release scenario:\r\nOur alternate release accident scenario involving chlorine would entail a puncture or other failure in a steel reinforced pipe system used in the chlorine railcar unloading process, with the 250 pound liquid chlorine contents within the common Cl2 line being released within 10 minutes.  According to EPA's RMP*COMP program, the distance to the endpoint of the cloud is 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\nWe are using this information to help ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation. The plant has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management Planning organization with management systems in place to ensure that all elements of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations are followed. All new facilities are subject to thorough hazard reviews during design, construction and startup utilizing a program called Safety in Engineering, Technology, Construction, and Operations (SETCO). This program is intended to eliminate or mitigate any possible releases of hazardous chemicals in the workplace or environment. The entire chlorine process was studied during a comprehensiv"

Cars positioned at the unloading station are protected by derail switches and monitored by video surveillance cameras.\r\nAlternate release scenario:\r\n* The chlorine unloading area is monitored by video surveillance cameras, periodic personnel inspections, and equipped with a number of highly sensitive chlorine detection instruments with alarms.\r\n* A computerized operating system automatically monitors the chlorine system at all times.\r\n* The chlorine unloading system is equipped with automatic shutoff valves and a railcar angle valve closure system.  When the Emergency Shutdown System is activated from any of the three locations, the emergency shutoff valves will close and previously opened angle valves will close from attached air motors to ensure total isolation.\r\n* The chlorine railcars are equipped with Railcar Motion Detectors.  In the event of accidental movement of connected railcar(s) to the process, the Railcar Motion Detector will activate the emergency shutdown system, thus closing the emergency shutoff valves and closing all previously opened railcar angle valves to ensure total isolation.  \r\n* The system is equipped with pressure relief valves, which will vent chlorine to a scrubber in the event of an overpressurization.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe had one accident in November 2013 involving chlorine that resulted in a reportable quantity release.
