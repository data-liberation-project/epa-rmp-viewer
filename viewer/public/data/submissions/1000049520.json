This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Propane loading and storage system.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nOxy Ingleside LPG Terminal, LLC covered process is the equipment and piping associated with the propane loading and storage system located at 1450 Lexington Blvd., Building 300 in Ingleside, TX. The regulated substances is propane. The main operation is described below:\n\npropane is received through a pipeline, where it is then filtered and dehydrated before being stored in storage spheres. It is then chilled and sent to ships for loading. No reactions or conversion are taking place at Oxy Ingleside LPG Terminal, LLC, therefore process chemistry does not need to be accounted for. The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 15,000,000 pounds of propane.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined for the covered process. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment report, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment, which is included as part of the RMP documentation.\n\n\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough the storage and transfer of propane has inherent potential risks and the worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community, Oxy Ingleside LPG Terminal, LLC has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the"

In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance:\n\nThe system has alarms.\n\nThe system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\nDetection is in place to notify individuals if a leak occurs.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Oxy Ingleside LPG Terminal, LLC to manage process safety issues associated with the use of propane. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis is a new facility and as such there have been no accidental releases within the last five years."
