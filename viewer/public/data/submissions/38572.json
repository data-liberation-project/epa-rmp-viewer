      "SummaryText": "   This location was opened in the spring of 1999, and as with our mother company, the Kensal Farmers Elevator of Kensal, ND which has been in operation for over 20 years with no accidental discharge or injuries as a result of operations, the Bordulac plant will also be operated with the utmost care, concern and training.  This will be accomplished by a rigid maintenance program on both the storage facility and the application equipment.  We will also provide training to all employees who are involved in the operation of the facility.  These employees in turn are qualified to inspect customer owned application equipment as well as instructing the end users on the proper handling.  We have also hired an independent Safety and Health Director to provide regular facility inspections and employee training sessions.  Through these training sessions, our employees are reminded of the need for preventitive maintenance, and the proper response in an emergency.  We are also coordinated with our local emergency management department.  In the remote case of a hose leak, or the complete loss of product from our largest container, we are prepared to handle it as safely as possible for everyone."
