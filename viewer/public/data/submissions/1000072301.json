This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant located in Loving County. Incoming gas enters the Mentone Plant and goes through an inlet slug catcher to remove liquids. Liquids from the slug catchers are heat stabilized using circulating hot oil to separate condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL). Stabilized condensate is sent to fixed roof storage tanks and then shipped offsite by pipeline or truck. NGL is sent to bullet tanks for storage then pipeline for sale. The gas is transferred into three gas treatment trains. Each of the three gas trains consists of an inlet separator with inlet heater and an amine contact tower for sweeting. Each contact tower feeds a common 600-gpm amine regenerator.  The amine regenerator overhead gas is controlled by a thermal oxidizer (TO) with a backup acid gas flare. The amine flash tank is routed to the low pressure gas gathering system, but is routed to the plant main flare if the gathering system is unavailable. A portion of the sweetened gas can be treated in a triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydrator and compressed to gas sales. The dehydrator flash tank is routed to the low pressure gathering system, but is routed to the main plant flare if the gathering system is unavailable. Sweetened gas enters cryogenic separators that remove methane and ethane which is compressed, "

      "SummaryText": "and sent to sales via three gas-fired outlet compressors. The NGLs are removed from the stream and sent to the NGL bullet tanks prior to pipeline.  \n\n\n\nFIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant is a newly constructed facility. There have been no accidents within the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Mentone Gas Plant is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The Mentone Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n"
