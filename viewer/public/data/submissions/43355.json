      "SummaryText": "Solo Cup is located at 4425 Mitchell Street in North Las Vegas and manufactures disposable food containers, including those consisting of polystyrene foam.  This foam production process uses Difluoroethane (CAS # 75-37-6).\n\nSolo Cup is dedicated to the safety of our employees and our community.  Our corporate safety policy reinforces Solo's commitment to providing a safe environment for our employees and our neighboring community.\n\nThe N. Las Vegas Solo Plant occupies 196,500 square feet of space on a 8 acre lot.\n\nThe worst case scenario listed depicts the release of 54,770 lbs of the subject material.  RMP Comp software was used to model this release.  There is potential for offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario listed depicts a 15 minute release of the subject material.  Excess flow detection control devices will mitigate any further release.\n\nThe emergency response program includes coordination with local emergency reponse.  Our emergency reponse plan includes notification procedures, emergency contacts, etc.  Employees are trained on emergency response annually.\n\nSafety training at Solo Cup is an ongoing process.  Safety review and evaluation is part of our company's day to day operations."
