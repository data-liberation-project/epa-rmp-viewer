Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the federal Accidental Release Prevention (RMP) Program requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nThis facilit"

Glanbia is responsible for running the plant production, warehousing, and distribution, while SMP and DFA will guarantee the milk requirements of the plant, which will be approximately 6.6 million pounds milk per day.  The 300,000 square foot facility lies on a 3,000-acre site southwest of the town of Clovis, New Mexico.\n\nConsidered to be North America\u00bfs largest cheddar cheese production plant, the facility will produce blocks of cheese weighing as much as 640 pounds.  It is expected that annual production will reach 250 million pounds of cheese and 16.5 million pounds of whey proteins using 2.3 billion pounds of milk.  The new facility will employ 205 workers when it reaches full production.\n\nProject design was provided by Power Engineers of Hailey, Idaho and E.A. Bonelli & Associates of Oakland, California.  Dahlgren Group of Seattle, Washington and the Carlisle Group from Minnesota are constructing the plant.  Applied Process Cooling Corporation (APCCO) of Modesto, California is providing the design and installation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe SouthWest Cheese Company plant is located at 1141 Curry Road 4 about six miles south of Clovis and Highways 60/84 and about two miles west of Highway 70.  The Clovis site was chosen for its proximity to a large, well-developed dairy producing region.  The plant is surround"

There are approximately 35,000 people living in Clovis, which was incorporated in 1909.  Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThe SouthWest Cheese Company facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a heat transfer fluid in the plant refrigeration system.  The system is a single-stage mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes direct liquid feed to glycol heat exchangers, which provide chilled glycol to the evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for production and storage of the product.\n\nThe heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporative condensers.  The condenser drains high-pressure liquid to the thermosiphon vessel for screw compressor cooling, which in turn, transfers high-pressure liquid to the high-pressure receiver (HPR).  Liquid from the HPR is transferred to the recirculator package (RP01) as needed for heat exchange and cooling in the evaporators via the glycol system.\n\nPRIMARY SYSTEM COMPONENTS\n\n(4)   Screw Compressor Packages\n(3)   Evaporative Condensers\n(1)   Thermosiphon Receiver\n(1)   High-Pressure Receiver\n(1)   Liquid Transfer Unit\n(3)   Plate and Frame Heat Exchangers\n(1)   Recirculator with ammonia pumps \n(1)   Oil Pot\n(3)   Glycol Pumps and Glycol Expansion Tank\n(13) Evaporator Coil Units\n\nAdditional system components include:\n\nInterconnecting piping; and\nControl valves\n\nSafety systems include:\n\n\t   Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels;\n\t   Compressor safety cutouts and control panels to shut down the compressor operation if safe operating conditions are exceeded;\n\t   Liquid level float switches;\n\t   High level vessel alarms;\n\t   Ventilation system for continuous and emergency ventilation;\n\t   Emergency Control Station with emergency ventil"

Some maintenance activities are contracted to a qualified refrigeration contractor.\n\nThere will be a trained maintenance crew on site during all hours of operation, and the ammonia refrigeration system will not be manned 24 hours.  The system is controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller and compressor microprocessors, which provide an advanced and reliable level of automated operation.
