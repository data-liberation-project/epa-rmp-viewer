The tank system consists of one, 30,000-gallon, aboveground tank and associated piping, which will hold 101,760 pounds of propane when filled to 80 percent of capacity. The purpose of the propane system is for the storage and sale of propane through redistribution to customers.\n\nThe worst case release scenario contained in this Risk Management Plan assumes that the 30,000-gallon tank fails resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the end-point is 0.38 mile. There are public receptors within this radius, with a total population of 11 based upon Landview III, an EPA and Bureau of Census software program.\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nSince the installation of the tanks in 1986, there has been no accidental release(s) of propane that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or any known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nIt is the policy of Schroeder's LP Gas, Inc., to notify the Town of Norwood Volunteer Fire Department  in the event of an emergency involving the 30,000-gallon, propane tank system located at this facility. A copy of this Risk Management Plan, and other appropriate system information is on file with the Town of Norwood Volunteer Fire Department. A representative of the Town of Norwood Volunteer Fire Department inspects this facility every six months and is aware of the facility layout. There are no safety improvements planned for this facility."
