This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Howard Glasscock -Acid Gas Injection /HG - AGI Plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nHoward Glasscock Acid Gas Injection Facility Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe Howard Glasscock Acid Gas Injection Facility is located approximately 8.1 miles east of Forsan, TX. The plant is designed to remove the H2S from 5 MMSCFD of natural gas at maximum capacity. The H2S gas is removed through amine treating and injected into well on location.  The treated gas is de-hydrated and sent to sales.  No liquids from the process are stored on the location. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\r\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program. Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\r\nChemical-specific steps Include:\r\n1.\tHydrocarbon Detectors; Carbon Dioxide Detectors; Hydrogen Sulfide Detectors\r\n2.\tProcess Safety Relief Valves;\r\n3.\tAutomated Plant Shutdown System.  The plant will be automatically shut-down should key process parameters vary from specified ranges;\r\n4.\tManual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process;\r\n5.\tAppropriately pla"
