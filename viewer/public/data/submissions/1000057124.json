It receives crude oil from multiple sources, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils. In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application. The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits.  \n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires Phillips 66 Company, Ferndale Refinery (Phillips 66) to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above threshold quantity (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery. The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the surrounding community, employees, and the environment. The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur. The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products. The facility receives oil from many sources via ship, pipeline or rail, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge or truck. The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil and sulfur. The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant "

The fuel products are stored onsite prior to shipment, and any non-hydrocarbon products (e.g. sulfur) is also stored prior to shipment. The facility has the utility and support systems required providing for safe operation of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe RMP contains two parts required for submittal:\n\n- RMP Executive Summary, Prevention Program Summary, and Management System Summary\n\n- RMP Data Elements\n\n\n\nThe original 1999 RMP effort at the facility was divided into three phases. First, the facility determined which processes were covered by the RMP regulation. The results of this study are published in the report titled \"Phase I: Inventory Determination\" which measured the quantities of regulated substances to determine which processes are subject to RMP. Next, the facility conducted the required hazard assessment as defined by the regulation.  The hazard assessment modeled accidental release scenarios that provided the refinery with insight into the potential for onsite processes to affect the surrounding community and the environment. Finally, Phase III of the RMP effort is provided in this document. It contains the executive summary of the overall RMP effort at the facility, a synopsis of the prevention program, a five-year accident history and summary of the management systems in place to implement and maintain the facility's risk management measures.\n\n\n\nIn June 2009, the covered refinery processes were divided into separate processing units, the Toxic Worst Case Release Scenario was revised to reflect current operations, stored railcar inventories were added, and another railcar Flammable Alternative Release Scenario was added. \n\n\n\nIn June 2014, equipment included in each covered processes was revised to better align with process flow, Maximum Intended Inventory (MII) data was updated based on revised process equipment listings, four (4) covered units were added per the "

The alternative release scenarios allow the facility to present scenarios that assume the use of administrative and actual controls in place at the facility. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for this and other hazard scenarios, and assumptions made, are provided in the Alternative Case Release Scenarios section of the 2016 RMP Update Report. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe RMP rule requires facilities to compile a 5-Year Accident History for all RMP regulated substances in covered processes at the facility. As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n- Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n\n- Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\n\n\nThe Facility has not had any RMP reportable incidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery.

Specific safety equipment and procedures, known as safeguards, are in place at the facility. These safeguards are listed as part of the process hazard analyses, process safety information, and in the operating procedures. Some examples of general safeguards are presented below:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n- Hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen fluoride and hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n- Facility alarm system to notify personnel in case of emergency\n\n- Ambient SO2 Monitoring Station\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n- Pressure Safety Valves (PSVs) to protect all pressure vessels\n\n- Operating materials recovery system with process flare to incinerate excess materials from the process\n\n- Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters\n\n- Excess flow valves that prevent product loss if a loading line should fail. \n\n- \"Fail-Safe\" valves to isolate equipment in case of unplanned events such as power failures and earthquakes\n\n- Containment around all tanks and process areas to contain liquid materials\n\n- Backup power supply for critical process equipment\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n- Deluge system for specific equipment\n\n- Trained emergency response personnel\n\n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n- Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\n- Backup fire protection equipment\n\n\n\nOther specific safeguards include:\n\n- Acid Inventory Management System (AIMS) for the hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which minimizes the potential release in the case of a leak or damage to equipment.\n\n- Perimeter monitors for hydrofluoric acid allow for rapid detection and response in the unlikely event of a leak of hydrofluor"

The Facility is a contributor to the community by protecting the plant and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations. The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur. In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control. The emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects. Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this emergency plan (ICP) is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating effective response procedures by all plant personnel so that danger to employees, contractors, the general public and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency. The emergency response procedure covers the entire facility, including refinery units that handle or produce regulated substances. It includes, but is not limited to: first-in response, evacuation, emergency shutdown, decontamination and medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\n\n\nTraining for emergency response is handled through the HSE Department, and is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and live exercises. As the facility continues to expand, the Emergency Response Plan (ICP) is updated to include the new refinery units and changes to operations. \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n\nThe Refinery Manager is ultimately responsible for imple"

The PSM Lead is responsible for upkeep of the Risk Management Plan and Hazard Assessment, and all supporting documentation. The individual departments assigned above implement each element of the Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS TO SAFETY\n\nThrough the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis program, Phillips 66 is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur. All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations from PHAs relating to safety and environment are prioritized by a risk matrix designed to address highest risk scenarios first. All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThe following are examples of the types of modifications made to the facility during the period from 2014 to 2016:\n\n1. Flare Upgrade Project: A new, higher capacity flare has been installed.\n\n2. Additional improvements have been made to pumps to prevent seal failures, such as pump replacements, seal modifications, safety interlocks, etc.\n\n3. Additional Safety Instrumented Systems interlocks have been installed in the Unit 1 Crude, Unit 4 FCC, Unit 5 FCC Gas Plant, Unit 18 Reformer, Unit 17 HF Alky.\n\n4. Upgraded seals were installed on compressors in Unit 5 FCC Gas Plant.\n\n5. Egress lighting was installed around the process units.\n\n\n\nThe following future projects will be implemented to enhance safety:\n\n1. Additional atmospheric PSVs will be routed to the flare system.\n\n2. A new Safety Instrumented System will be installed for the LPG area in Unit 9 Offplot.\n\n3. Existing Safety Instrumented Systems will be upgraded.\n\n4. Additional improvements will be made to pumps to prevent seal failures, such as pump replacements, seal modifications, safety interlocks,"
