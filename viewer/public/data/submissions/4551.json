The raw materials utilized by the plant include water, salt, and electricity. Several of the chemicals manufactured and stored at the facility are present at or above threshold amounts for regulated substances and are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68. The substances subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases, are chlorine  (Cl2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a \"significant\" release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect \"public receptors\" (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the HoltraChem facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). The HoltraChem Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this HoltraChem facility under 40 CFR Part 68.  Program 3 related information is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n2.1  Chlorine Production System \n\nChlorine is produced at the HoltraChem Orrington facility as part of an electrolytic process in which a strong electrical current is passed through a mixture of salt and water (brine).

Chlorine is then transferred to 90 ton capacity railcars for shipping.\n\n\n\n\n2.2  Hydrochloric Acid System\n\n\nHydrochloric acid is produced as part of the same electrolytic process used in the chlorine production system. Sodium atoms created in the electrolytic process are converted through chemical processes to caustic soda and hydrogen.  The hydrogen is then burned with chlorine to form high strength 230Be hydrochloric acid (38% HCL solution in water). The HCl solution is stored at ambient temperature in a tank farm, which is surrounded by a concrete dike.  The HCl is then pumped into tank trucks for shipment.\n\n\n\n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions, which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worse-cases\" defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by HoltraChem to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented.

For toxic gases such as Cl2 stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period. Toxic liquids, like HCl, are assumed to spill instantaneously and spread to a depth of 1 cm in an undiked area or to cover a diked area.  The duration of the release is based on the evaporation rate of the toxic liquid and the amount spilled. The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic \"endpoints\", is considered the worst-case release for each facility.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established \"toxic endpoints\" for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n\"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute concentration averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifi"

The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. \n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the HoltraChem Orrington facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is 'urban' in nature, due to the buildings, tanks and structures at the site.  At greater distances, although the area is heavily vegetated, the surface roughness becomes more 'rural', especially along the river valley.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, HoltraChem has elected to model the worst-case release scenario assuming 'rural' surface conditions. However, it should be noted that under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces located near the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG) was utilized to determine distance to toxic endpoint values for the worst-case release scenarios. The OCAG guidance lists a number of refined dispersion models that are also available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  Both chlorine and hydrochloric acid have molecular weights that are substantially greater than the ambient air.  For this reason, concentrated plumes of these substances resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such a case, near-field dispersion "

One of the models listed in the OCAG  commonly used for heavy-gas releases is SLAB.  SLAB, developed by Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, can be utilized to model scenarios that are not directly addressed in the 1999 Revised OCAG.   For these reasons, the OCAG was used to determine the endpoint distances for the worst case releases, while SLAB was used to determine the endpoint distances for the more complex alternative release scenarios.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of four years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at the Bangor International Airport, ME, indicates that these dispersion conditions occasionally occur in the area.  The most predominant directions of transport are to the north and southeast. \n\nWorst-case dispersion modeling conducted with EPA's RMP 1999 Revised OCAG indicates that, among the two regulated substances, chlorine would result in the greatest distance to toxic endpoint. The toxic endpoint for Cl2 is 0.0087 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the \"worst-case\" Cl2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the HoltraChem Orrington facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  40 CFR Part 68 requires that the substance with the largest distance to toxic endpoint be reported in the Worst-Case Release section of the Risk Management Plan.   Therefore, only the Cl2 release results are included in the Data Elements section.\n\n3.1.1    Worst-Case Release: Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Orrington facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 300,000 lbs of stored Cl2, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  A gaseous release of this magnitude over such a short t"

Even if the storage tank were to breach, liquid Cl2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  The selection of the worst-case release for Cl2 should, therefore, be viewed as a regulatory required program element, rather than a realistic representation of a worst-case release event.\n\nThe modeling results indicated that under 'rural' surface conditions the worst-case Cl2 release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of greater than 25 miles.  The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 130,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local area (DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. Several environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) are also located within the worst-case impact zone.  The closest environmental receptor is the Black Woods.  \n\n\n3.2    Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the "

In accordance with the EPA's OCAG, a single alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated substance. \n\nHoltraChem performed a thorough review of the facility utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts. Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, HoltraChem has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for each regulated substance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Bangor, ME, confirmed that these conditions are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the SLAB dense gas dispersion model.  Because the surface roughness in the immediate vicinity of the Orrington facility is urban in nature, and alternative releases typically result in relatively short endpoint distances, an urban surface roughness value was utilized in the alternative release modeling. \n\n3.2.1     Chlorine\n\nThe alternative Cl2 release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break in the Cl2 loading line to the railcar.

The modeling indicated that Cl2 would be released at a rate of 125 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the Cl2 would then be dispersed as a heavy gas.  HoltraChem has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 6 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of Cl2, resulting in a total release of 750 lbs.  This alternative Cl2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the \"worst-case\".  \n\nThe SLAB modeling indicates that under urban conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 1.0 miles. The hazard impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 900 persons, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated in conjunction with EPA's Landview III database program.  Public receptors in the alternative impact zone include a school, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas.  No environmental receptors would be affected.\n\n3.2.2    Hydrochloric Acid \n\nThe alternative HCl release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves overfilling a tank truck.

The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified.\n\nDuring the past 5 years (June 1994 to June 1999), there has been one accident involving an ARP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68. The accident which occurred on an evening in November 1997,  did not result in any injuries, deaths or property damage, but involved off-site site emergency response, provided by the Orrington Fire Department.  This accident involved collision of a railcar with a chlorine railcar that was in the process of being loaded.  An estimated 1600 lbs of chlorine was released. The release, which was effectively stopped after about ten minutes, was also reported by HoltraChem via telephone to the Maine State Police, Penobscot County Sheriff and the National Response Center.  The subsequent accident investigation determined that operator error was the key factor in the accident.
