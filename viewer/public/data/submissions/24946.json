The Facility Policy\n        The owners, management, and employees of The Yield Co. are committed to the prevention of any\n             accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\n             prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and\n             minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.      Facility Information\n         - The primary activity is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n         - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application and delivered for\n              farmer application.\n         - Prepare mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n         - The maximum quantity stored would be 225,000 pounds in our two storage tanks and two dozen\n              nurse tanks.\n  \n3.       The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n          A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest\n               storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n               15,300 pounds, which represents the volume of the biggest storage tanks at 85 percent capacity\n               as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is \n               .8 miles.\n          B.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\n                potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint\n                (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n4.       The accidental release prevention program.\n          The facility has implemented the provision of \"Safety Requiremen"

The Five-year Accident History\n          A.   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have\n                 caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,\n                 have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or \n                 environmental damage.\n\n6.        The emergency response program.\n           - The facility has:\n           A.    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n                   information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.        Planned changes to improve safety.\n           Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\n                 assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous\n                 ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
