The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM). The PSM program is executed through YEX1's partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a stakeholder in the YEX1 operation and has offices and staff on-site.  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of YEX1 and WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \n\n\n\nYEX1 has adopted a \"non-responding facility\" policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the Yuma Community Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established; coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  One of the ways that emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current is via the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  WPS also supports membership in the LEPC and the now annual Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day (YAASD).  WPS has been involved in YAASD planni"

Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  Ammonia emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  Each company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (production workers contracted by YEX1 are trained for their emergency actions.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Yuma Express facility is located in Yuma, AZ in a commercial/industrial area outside the city.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage prior to shipping distribution throughout the country.  The fresh produce is on-site generally four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April. \n\n\n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to"

The vessels are rated at higher pressure and temperature than the equipment it is transferred out of.  The vessels are provided shade, traffic barriers and a water sprinkler system.  The water sprinkler system reduces pressure and temperature on very hot days in the Yuma area.   \n\n\n\nOperation of the facility is a coordinated effort. Yuma Express Cooling, LLC is an Arizona Limited Liability Company made up of Western Precooling Systems (WPS) - 50 % and a group of individuals and entities affiliated with American Growers Cooling LLC (AGCC) - 50 %.  Yuma Express Cooling, LLC leases the site including stationary refrigeration equipment to Taylor Farms.  Separately, WPS leases portable refrigeration equipment to Taylor Farms.  Maintenance of the entire refrigeration system is the responsibility of WPS which has offices and staff on-site. WPS and Taylor Farms work together to implement the Risk and Process Safety Management Plan which is in the name of Yuma Express Cooling, LLC - Site #1.  Site #2 is at a separate address with a different Lessee, and has its own RMP. \n\n\n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's RMP/PSM Plan.\n\n\n\nWPS is the company that maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.

The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to dis-assembly and moving portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, YEX1 and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its Ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt is apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility uses these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Yuma Express, LLC:\n\n - The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access and to increase the security of the facility from potential \"wrong-doers\".\n\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc.  Training is documented in each employees training record file.\n\n - Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.

Only the Yuma Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.
