To the northeast of the base is the community of Lebanon, to the southeast is Mascoutah, to the west are Belleville and Shiloh, and to the northwest is O'Fallon. MidAmerica Airport lies adjacent to the base to the north and east, and the remaining areas surrounding the base consists of some of the finest farmland within the state. The City of St. Louis is located only 20 miles to the west. Springfield, the capital of Illinois, is just over 100 miles north of the installation.\n\n\n\nThe total SAFB community is made up of more than 30,900 military and civilian personnel and their families living on and off base. SAFB employs nearly 13,000 airmen and civilians. In addition, there are also about 8,500 military retirees that the base serves.\n\n\n\nThe 375 Air Mobility Wing is the host unit at SAFB. \n\n\n\nSAFB is also the home of other groups that include the United States Transportation Command, Air Mobility Command, Illinois Air National Guard 126 AW and the Air Force Reserve 932 Aeromedical Airlift Wing. Major groups under the 375 AW include the 375 Operations Group, 375 Logistics Group, 375 Support Group, and the 375 Medical Group.\n\n\n\nThe 375 AW is host to a number of on- and off-base tenant units. These organizations represent a variety of critical Department of Defense (DOD) activities. \n\n\n\nThere are a more than 1,400 military family housing units at SAFB. Of these units, including multi-unit dormitory style buildings and family housing. \n\n\n\nRisk Management Background\n\n\n\nA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been implemented at Scott AFB for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community from hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with sp"

The Risk Management Program regulations require facilities that store certain chemicals in excess of a threshold amount to prepare a comprehensive Risk Management Program. The Risk Management Program requires facilities to evaluate the consequences of certain accidents involving hazardous chemicals, to prepare a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases, and to have an emergency response program for taking action in the event of a release. Scott AFB's RMP currently covers the chlorine storage at the WWTP, the only location where hazardous chemicals are stored in excess of the RMP threshold. Scott AFB also stores large quantities of propane, which does not exceed the RMP threshold. Chlorine is the only chemical that will be addressed in the RMP. \n\n\n\nScott AFB has examined the elimination of chlorine gas as a disinfection method at the WWTP.\n\n\n\n2.0    RMP APPLICABILITY\n\n\n\nChlorine is the sole hazardous  chemical at Scott AFB that requires Scott AFB to maintain a Risk Management Plan and meet stringent reporting requirements. Chlorine is stored and used at the base Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) (Building 3292) for disinfection of wastewater discharges. Scott AFB currently stores four 2,000 lb. cylinders of chlorine gas at the wastewater treatment plant (Building 3292). Since the last RMP update in 2008, two of the original six cylinders were removed. The cylinders are stored inside Building 3292. The significant quantity of"

      "SummaryText": " chlorine stored in this process exceeds the RMP threshold for chlorine of 2,500 lbs. The cylinders are pigtailed together in pairs, with each pair of cylinders sharing a common control valve. This valve switches over automatically when the flow from one cylinder drops below a specified level. During normal operation, the main valves on all four cylinders remain open.\n\n\n\n3.0    HAZARD (OFF-SITE ANALYSIS)\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\nThis section summarizes the worst-case release scenario and public receptors associated with the chlorine process at the WWTP. Chlorine is stored at the WWTP near the southeast corner of the base property. Although the WWTP is located away from a majority of the base population, there are several public access areas nearby which would be of concern during a worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release scenario or circle of concern as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The worst case release scenario for toxic gases is assumed to be the total release of the single largest container in the process over a 10-minute duration. The worst case release scenario for the WWTP chlorine storage at Scott AFB would involve the failure of a chlorine cylinder containing 2,000 lbs. of chlorine. The chlorine would be released as a gas, and would form a vapor cloud that would travel in a downwind direction. If 2,000 lbs of chlorine gas were released over a 10-minute duration the endpoint would be 1.3 miles from the site of chlorine storage. \n\n\n\nA chlorine gas release from the chlorine storage area at the WWTP would affect public receptors during a worst-case release scenario. A public receptor is defined as \"off-site residences, institutions (e.g., schools, hospitals) industrial, commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time without restri"

      "SummaryText": "ction by the stationary source where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release\" (40 CFR 68.3). For the purposes of this RMP, any building or area on Base where public access is allowed on an unrestricted basis was considered a public receptor. Public receptors at Scott AFB would include residences, recreational areas and a school. \n\n\n\nRMP regulations require an estimate of the residential population within the circle of concern for the worst-case scenario.  For chlorine, approximately 41,000 persons could be impacted.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis (ARS)\n\n\n\nAn ARS event is more probable than a worst-case scenario. The RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants provides a standard table for an unmitigated release rate. The WWTP chlorine storage area is enclosed by a permanent structure. The release of a liquefied gas from a 1-ton cylinder (under 98.5 psig) due to a sheered valve or line would result in a release rate of 10 lbs/min over a 30-minute period. The release would travel a distance of 0.2 miles and would reach the base jogging trail a nearby playground.\n\n\n\n4.0    PROGRAM LEVEL DETERMINATION\n\n\n\nThe EPA outlines three program levels for the RMP Prevention Program. Scott AFB's chlorine storage and usage at the WWTP qualifies as a Program Level 2 Prevention Program under Illinois EPA and the OSHA PSM rule (29 CFR 1910.119) with a threshold of 1,500 lbs.\n\n\n\nScott AFB also stores large amounts of propane.  The amount of propane stored at the Fire Training Facility does not exceed the 67,000-lbs threshold and the RMP rule does not apply to this source. \n\n\n\n5.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nScott AFB currently maintains a Prevention Program for this Program Level 2 process (chlorine) contained in a separate document entitled \"Accident Prevention and Process Safety Management Program.\" This prevention program ensures that:\n\n\n\nProcess safety information is provided to all employ"

Scott AFB reports all releases of hazardous chemicals, regardless of , to local and state regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\n8.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO ELIMINATE CHLORINE STORAGE/USE\n\n\n\nScott AFB currently employs a safety checklist when changing chlorine gas cylinders at the WWTP. \n\n\n\nIn an effort to eliminate RMP requirements and reduce risk of chlorine release, Scott AFB conducted a study to determine alternatives to chlorine disinfection at the WWTP. Three alternatives were developed with a focus on eliminating chlorine storage: (1) changing chlorine storage cylinder  to reduce storage capacity to under the 1,500-lbs threshold, (2) utilize a substitute disinfection chemical and (3) utilize a non-chemical disinfection technology. \n\n\n\nPrudent Technologies interviewed WWTP personnel to identify any solutions to reducing chlorine storage cylinder .\n\n\n\nSubstitute chemicals would require infrastructure improvements. Such chemicals included ozone, peroxone and others.\n\n\n\nThe preferred cost-effective solution to eliminate chlorine use at the WWTP is the implementation of ultra-violet (UV) disinfection technology. If this alternative were implemented, Scott AFB would no longer be subject to RMP regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nScott AFB has no future p"
