      "SummaryText": "the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nIII. Facility Identification\nThe Frozen Assets facility is located at 2635 South Western Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.  The faclity is a cold storage warehouse.\n\nThe NAICS Code for the facility is 49312.  Most areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve finished goods.\n\nThe facility used ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP rule.  One (1) ammonia refrigeration system onsite is used for refrigerating finished food products.\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the ammonia refrigeration system is approximately 20,000 pounds.  The ammonia refrigeration system is used to cool the holding freezer, blast freezers, holding coolers, product re-pack area, and the inspection areas.  This system is a three stage system with two (2) high stage screw compressors for high temperature loads, two (2) low stage screw compressors for the holding freezer, and one (1) ultra low stage booster compressor for the blast freezers. Evaporators in the cooled areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the high temperature accumulator, via an internal pipe.  All of the evaporators are hot gas defrosted and are operated by the refrigeration control system.  The two (2) low temperature compressors discharge to the evaporative condensers.\n\nThe ultra low suction pressure is provided by the booster compressor.  The booster compressor operates as a two-stage system.  The ultra low temperature accumulator is fed make-up ammonia liquid from the low temperature accumulator and provides liquid to the three bottom feed blast freezer evaporators.  The booster compressor discharges into the high temperature accumulator.\n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\n\nIV.

Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nAppendix B contains the RMP Submit Printout and includes additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D contains the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario.\n\nVI. General Accidental Release Prevention Plan\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  However, as discussed throughout this document, Frozen Assets is actively working on improving this program.\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.  The next audit of the PSM program will occur by March, 2009, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM, Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are losted below:\n- Employee Perticipation - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing a process hazard analysis and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.\n- Process Safety Information - Frozen Assets maintains a site specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained.  \n- Process Hazard Analysis - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted, at a minimum, every five (5) years, and whenever required by the written Management of Change program.  In addition, this program ensures PHA's are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations an"

Frozen Assets conducted a thorough PHA study of the ammonia refrigeration system during September, 2004.\n- Operating Procedures - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Frozen Assets developed operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system during November, 2004.  Annually, the operating procedures will be reviewed and certified as accurate.  \n- Training - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n- Management of Change - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review -  Frozen Assets has developed a site specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n- Mechanical Integrity - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  Frozen Assets formalized maintenance procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system during November, 2004.\n- Contractor Qualifications - Frozen Assets has developed a site specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance a"

Emergency Communications\nThe telephone numbers of agencies and plant personnel that may be contacted in case of an emergency are available onsite.\n\nX. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \nChemical safety is an important part of Frozen Assets operations.  Frozen Assets recently conducted a process hazard analysis of their ammonia refrigeration system and will be dutifully implementing the recommendations from that analysis.  Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Frozen Assets.\n\nXI. Management Program\nFrozen Assets has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or positions) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organizational chart or similar document.  Currently, Tom Smith, President of Operations, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program."
