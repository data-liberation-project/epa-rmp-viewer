      "SummaryText": "description and the regulated substances handled\nThe Pinnacle Dos Picos Gas Plant is a natural gas processing facility in which unprocessed natural gas is brought in via pipeline and processed to two main product streams, natural gas(98% methane) and Natural Gas Liquids (this is a mixed stream of the heavier than methane hydrocarbons). The processing of the natural gas also uses a propane refrigeration system which holds 17,600 gallons of propane or 85,712 pounds. In regard to the natural gas and NGLs there are approximately 158,607 pounds of hydrocarbon gasses in the plant at any given time and 512,456 pounds of hydrocarbon liquids in the plant at any given time in addition to the propane refrigeration. These numbers can fluctuate slightly at any given time based on the nature of unprocessed natural gas.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nThe Pinnacle Does Picos Gas Plant fully complies with all 14 elements of the OSHA PSM requirements outlined in 1910.119. Additionally, the plant complies with all 40 CFR 112 requirements for SPCC. All plant employees participate in both monthly and annual trainings as well as a gambit of new hire training upon joining the company. Additionally, the plant is planning to complete annual emergency mock drills once in service. Some of these mock drills will include agencies such as the local fire department. The Pinnacle Dos Picos Gas Plant is manned 24/7 with operators monitoring all systems from the control room as well as completing regular rounds through the plant on every shift.\n\nThe five-year accident history\nThe Pinnacle Dos Picos Gas Plant is new construction and not yet in service at time of RMP filing in August of 2022 so there is no five-year accident history. However, Pinnacle Dos Picos first began building assets in November 2020. In the near two years of operations, Pinnacle has had zero recordable injuries and zero reportable hazardous chemical spills.
