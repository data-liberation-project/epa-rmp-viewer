Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nFXI, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nFXI, Inc. is located at 1750 West Downs Street in West Chicago, Illinois.  FXI, Inc. manufactures and fabricates slab stock polyurethane foam and finished foam products (i.e., mattresses, pads, and pillow) and is classified under the NACIS Code of 326150, urethane and other foam products (except polystyrene) manufacturing. \n\n\n\nPolyurethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in two (2) storage tanks - one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank and one (1) 6,000-gallon storage tank.  At times TDI is also stored in up to four (4) 18,000-gallon railcars until unloading occurs.  Therefore, the total combined maximum physical volume on site at any one time is approximately 108,000 gallons (1,098,360 lbs).\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.

Accidental Release Prevention and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nFXI, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\n\n\nFXI, Inc.'s specific prevention steps include:\n\n   1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n   2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n\n   3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n\n   4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n   5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nD.  Hazard Assessment:\n\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. \n\n\n\nA release from an 18,000-gallon railcar has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.  The catastrophic release would release approximately 183,060 lbs. of TDI. \n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endp"

There are approximately less than thirty (30) people in nearby industrial setting that may be within the potentially affected area.  The railcar unloading area is located on the south side of the building.  At present there is no secondary containment for the railcar unloading area.\n\n\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPComp Model.  The RMPComp model estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.6 miles for the worst-case scenario.  The impact distance extends beyond the facility boundary.  There are no persons residing within the potentially affected area.                    \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  FXI, Inc. has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is a piping release (flange leak or failure in the process line) from the process line carrying TDI from the tank to the pouring head.  The leak would release approximately 1,080 lbs of TDI.  The RMPComp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario.  The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line.  There are no persons residing within the potentially affected areas.\n\n         \n\nE.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: FXI, Inc. has completed a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review has been conducted using the process safety information gathered to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \n\n\n\nHazard Review: FXI, Inc. will update and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and every five (5) years.
