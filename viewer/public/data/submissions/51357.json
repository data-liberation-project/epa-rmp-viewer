The facility was recognized in 1996 by the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) with the presentation of the \u00bfPartnership Award\u00bf.  The award recognizes extraordinary contributions to chemical emergency preparedness and prevention programs.\n\n\u00bf\tConsideration is underway to change from the bulk storage of sulfur dioxide to significantly smaller cylinder volumes.  If suitable, such a change would remove this chemical from the program as the quantity on site would be less than the threshold planning quantity.\n \n\n\u00bf\tWorst case accident scenario: The worst-case scenario is the potential failure of a storage tank containing 25,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide.  In this scenario, sulfur dioxide would be released onto the ground and evaporating sulfur dioxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\u00bf\tThe alternative accident scenarios:  Alternative scenarios for sulfur dioxide and ammonia were selected using the following criteria:\n\u00bf\tReviewing documented facility incident history;\n\u00bf\tReviewing documented Process Hazards Analysis;\n\u00bf\tReviewing published estimated failure rates of equipment; and,\n\u00bf\tReviewing mitigation devices.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, it was decided that the facility would use one alternative accident scenario for each covered chemical.
