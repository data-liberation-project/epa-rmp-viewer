The primary function of this plant is to treat water. In the process of water treatment the District utilizes the use of two regulated toxic substances, chlorine and an ammonia concentration.\n  Chlorine, in the form of a gas and liquid, is received from the manufacture in standard two ton containers. The maximum amount that we will have on site is 48,000 pounds. A 30 % ammonia solution is received from the manufacture, in the form of a liquid, and pumped into one of two 6,000 gallon bulk storage tanks. The maximum amount of ammonia that the District will have on site will be 97,000 pounds (ammonia and water solution).\n  The District is a safety minded organization, having regular safety meetings, with management reviewing and implementing new safety guidelines as needed.\n  The District used the EPA's RMP*Comp to analyze the regulated toxic substances worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n   Worst case release scenario for chlorine:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine, the release was in an enclosed space with direct contact with outside air. The release was in rural surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 3 miles. There would be an offsite impact with this release due to a residential population estimated at 2,000 persons and several recreation parks located at the Lake.\n   Alternative release scenario for chlorine:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 1,000 pounds of chlorine, the release was in an enclosed space with direct contact with outside air. The release was in rural surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 0.4 miles. There would be an offsite impact with this release due to a residential population estimated at 150 persons and two recreation parks located at the Lake.\n  Wors"
