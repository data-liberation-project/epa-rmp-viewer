      "SummaryText": "This risk management plan (RMP) is for Duke Energy Florida, LLC's Hines Energy Complex.  The Hines facility is an electric generating plant that operates combined-cycle natural gas/oil-fired combustion turbines.  The process affected by Section 112(r) requirements is the storage of aqueous ammonia in four (4) separate storage systems. The four (4) tanks are used to store aqueous ammonia for use in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx emissions. Tank 1 serves the SCRs associated with combustion turbines (CTs) 1A and 1B, Tank 2 serves the SCRs associated with CTs 2A and 2B, Tank 3 serves the SCRs associated with CTs 3A and 3B and Tank 4 serves the SCRs associated with CTs 4A and 4B.  The ammonia concentration in water is 30% by weight (wt/wt), and it is stored in four (4) individual 30,000-gallon tanks; i.e., 63,036 pounds of ammonia in each tank; therefore the maximum amount of ammonia stored in each process is 63,036 pounds.  Each tank is surrounded by a concrete containment structure that is capable of holding the entire contents of the associated tank.  The concrete containment structures will provide passive mitigation in the event of a release.   Since the ammonia concentration is less than 44%, this process is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Corrections to this RMP resubmission include changes to the zone of impact based on an increase in the highest temperatures recorded in the last three (3) years at Lakeland, Florida Linder Airport.\n\n\n\nReleases are prevented through the use of well-maintained storage equipment.  There have been no releases of aqueous ammonia at the site during the last five (5) years.  The first tank was installed in September 1998.  Ammonia storage quantities have been reported to, and emergency response procedures coordinated with the District 7 LEPC, which is the Polk County Emergency Operations Office.\n\n"
