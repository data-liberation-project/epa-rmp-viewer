Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWe will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are\r\ncurrent with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection\r\nand maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment.  Authorized personnel will make changes to the\r\nfacility if any audits of the facility identify non-compliance with Section 112 (r)(7), Accidental\r\nRelease Prevention Requirements of the Clean Air Act."
