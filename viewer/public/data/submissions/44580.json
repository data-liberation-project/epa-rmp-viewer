      "SummaryText": "At BASF Corporation's Hannibal Plant, we manufacture several agricultural products.  At this plant, we are very concerned with protecting our employees and our environment. We are also concerned with protecting our families that live in nearby communities.\n\nWe have designed our facilities to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facilities. It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations.  We have developed and implemented the following to help achieve our goals:\n\n* State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\n* Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\n* An extensive safety, health and process safety management system\n* Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\n* An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\n* Plant site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\n\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the plant's policy to maintain an up-to-date emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The plant works closely with area, community, emergency-response agencies providing them with information on plant operations and response programs in addition to conducting periodic training with members of the local emergency response agencies.\n\nBASF's Hannibal facility has eight substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.  These compounds are acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, bromine, chlorine, ethyl mercaptan, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus tr"

All of these are used as raw materials to produce agricultural products.\n\nAcrylonitile\n\nAcrylonitrile, a liquid, is shipped to the plant by tank truck (about 44,000 pounds per tank truck). During unloading, the truck is stationed in a containment area designed to hold 110% of the truck's contents. Acrylonitrile is unloaded via top unloading system into its storage tank. A unique tank truck and unloading station are used to ensure that only the correct raw material is unloaded into the storage tank. The storage and handling system design minimizes potential leaks by eliminating all tank bottom nozzles and by using the latest control devices.\n\nThe acrylonitrile storage tank is housed in a secondary containment area. It is pumped to the chemical processing equipment to make the agricultural products. A scrubber destroys all fumes from the unloading operation, the storage tank and the chemical processing steps. The total plant inventory is about 66,000 pounds. This total includes the maximum allowable acrylonitrile in the storage tank, in pipes & hoses, and the amount in the chemical process.\n\nAmmonia\n\nLiquid, anhydrous ammonia is received by tank truck (approximately 26,000 pounds per truck) and is stored in a single steel tank at ambient temperature and under its own vapor pressure. This tank is located within a concrete secondary containment system.  The tank is equipped with overpressure protection and is rated to withstand full vacuum. The total ammonia inventory is 41,000 pounds. This includes the amount in the storage tank and associated piping that handle anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling system consists of an unloading station with secondary containment system, a storage tank, two pumps and piping.

Unique pipefittings are used to ensure that only the correct material is unloaded into the TMA storage tank. TMA is transferred to the chemical process to make an intermediate for an agricultural product. The total plant inventory is 280,000 pounds.\n\nThe Hannibal plant has a well-established accident prevention program. The primary purpose of the program is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property loss and environmental or community impact. The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure reliable and predictable operations. The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected events. The program consists of four fundamental elements: (1) written procedures; (2) training; (3) auditing; (4) process reviews or evaluation.\n\n(1) The written procedures include personal health and safety, work practices, equipment operation, loss prevention, and related topics. The procedures are implemented using administrative, engineering and personal protective equipment controls. The procedures receive periodic review and are revised as necessary.\n\n(2) The training element includes job specific safety, emergency response and hazard awareness training. Training plans are specifically developed for various employee groups. The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\n\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits.  Internal audits are completed using a wide range of plant resources.  Plant personnel conduct routine general inspections of plant facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Facility personnel conduct extended plant-wide audits at a minimum three-year frequency.   These audits include safety, housekeeping, transportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechani"

This total includes the maximum allowable bromine in the storage tank and the amount in the chemical process.\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is shipped to the plant in one ton cylinders. One ton cylinders are widely available and are used in a variety of industries. Upon receipt, the cylinders are placed into specially designed cradles and transported to a cylinder storage shed for weather protection. When needed, the cylinders are moved to a separate building which houses a chlorine dispensing system which vaporizes the chlorine and conveys it to the chemical manufacturing process where it is consumed. One cylinder is connected to the dispensing system at a time. A maximum of eight cylinders is allowed in the dispensing building including the one being used. The maximum number of cylinders allowed on the plant site is twenty-six.

Ethyl mercaptan may also be received by tank truck in quantities of approximately 5,000 gallons.  Trucks are also unloaded in concrete secondary containment systems provided for unloading.\n\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system. The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product. The total inventory for the storage tank, chemical processing equipment and pipes is about 330,000 pounds. Transportation, unloading, and use of mercaptan are managed under plant operating procedures.  \n\nPhosphorus oxychloride and phosphorus trichloride\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride and phosphorus trichloride is also transported to the plant via tank truck.

Its primary purpose is to guide plant personnel during emergency situations. The secondary purpose is to communicate to the surrounding communities and area response agencies how the facility intends to respond to potential emergency situations. The plan's objective is to provide a coordinated response to potential plant emergencies that could threaten employee health and safety, the local community, the environment or plant property.\n\nThe plant maintains experienced personnel who are fully trained to respond to potential emergencies arising from fires, hazardous material releases, and medical emergencies and confined space incidents. The various teams are equipped to respond to plant emergencies.  The plant recognizes the potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency situations. Therefore, plant emergency response teams work closely with members of the Palmyra, Hannibal, Quincy and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing plant response information, conducting joint training exercises, providing emergency response support to communities for incidents not related to plant activities, and in many areas participating in local voluntary response agencies.\n\nT"
