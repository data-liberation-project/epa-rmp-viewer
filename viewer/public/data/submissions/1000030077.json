              "Description": "Plant 1 Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\n\n\nDear Sirs,\n\n\n\nI have had to duplicate the information entry for the Prevention Programs.  There seems to be a bug from when you choose a program in Section 1 for Prevention Program entry.  The Process ID does not match what was selected.  I can't get the validation errors to go away unless I make more Prevention Programs than we actually have.  We use the same prevention program for both of our ammonia systems, so all three entries will be the same.\n\n\n\nIf there are any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.\n\n\n\nBruce Priestner\n\nCargill Beef\n\n1252 Route 706, PO Box 188\n\nWyalusing, PA 18853\n\n(570)746-3000 ext. 7370",

      "SummaryText": "Cargill Inc. produces beef products at our plant in Wyalusing. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner and the facility has been recognized as an OSHA Star site in the VPP Program.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility as the refrigerant, similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system. Ammonia is used to keep air temperatures in our process areas, coolers, and freezers in specified ranges. We also use ammonia to perform some air conditioning and process cooling.  These temperatures are required to assure food safety. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\n\n\nCargill Inc. takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Utilities Superintendent is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility operates two refrigeration systems with an ammonia inventory of approximately 74,500 and 13,400 pounds respectively. Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Wyalusing plant.\n\n\n\nC. Summary of worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n No Longer Required.\n\n\n\nD. Description of the Accidental Release "

      "SummaryText": "Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n-Employee Participation Program\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Training Program\n\n-Contractor Safety Program\n\n-Pre-Start-up Safety Review Procedures\n\n-Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n-Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n-Management of Change Procedures\n\n-Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n-Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\nE. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable releases for the last five years.\n\n\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Wyalusing plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nThe plant response team utilizes employees who are trained to enter and stop an accidental ammonia release.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to improve Safety\n\n\n\nCargill Inc. is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration systems in a safe and responsible manner. We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective. Recent improvements include upgrading the safety relief systems to meet changes in ASHRAE/IIAR codes.\n\n\n\nThe 2015 Correction is based on using 2010 Census data versus 2000 Census data that was available in 2012, as well as a more modern ALOHA modeling software.  The large change in population is due to the ability of the newer software's ability to calculate a population in an ALOHA modeling area, and not just within a radius of origin."
