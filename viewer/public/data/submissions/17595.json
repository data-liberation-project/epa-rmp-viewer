Chapman Water Recycling Facility in Spring Valley, CA.  The CalARP Program satisfies the requirements of the County and the Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act. The Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility uses chlorine in excess of the threshold quantities under 40 CFR Part 68 and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations. Based on the amount of Regulated Substances (RSs) handled at the facility and the facility's PSM requirements, the facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\n\nTo satisfy the CalARP Program requirements, OWD is submitting this RMP and CalARP Program.  OWD is also submitting a RMP as required under the Federal guidelines using the RMP Submit program.  The program summarizes the processes involving the RS handled at the facility and the potential hazards associated with the handling of the RS.  The approach and technical evaluation methods used to review the RS-handling processes and mitigate the potential hazards are also presented. \n\nThis Program is based on a Process Hazards Analysis, Offsite Consequence Analysis, and Seismic Assessment that were completed to evaluate the processes involving the RS.  The Program also documents recommendations arising from the evaluations and a schedule for implementation of the recommendations.  In accordance with the RMP program guidelines, the Program contains the following elements:\n\n7 Hazard Assessment, including a worst case analysis, an alternative release analysis, and a five-year accident history;\n7 Management Program, including a document management system;\n7 Prevention Program, including process safety information, a"

      "SummaryText": " process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, maintenance programs, incident investigation programs, documentation of compliance audits, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, contractor requirements, employee participation programs, and hot work permit requirements; and\n7 Emergency Response Program, including biweekly drills for the emergency response team.\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility is in compliance with the requirements of the CalARP and RMP programs.  The facility has not had any accidents involving RSs in the past five years.  The facility is committed to operating with management programs that protect both the workers at the facility and the public from accidental release of RSs.  The facility has implemented detailed training, maintenance, and inspection programs that serve to prevent releases of an RS.  OWD has an on-site HAZWOP team and emergency response team that is trained to respond to emergencies involving the chlorine system.  The HAZWOP team is trained to stop leaks and quickly repair equipment to avoid any offsite consequences.  In addition, to reduce the potential impact of a chlorine accident, OWD has committed to installing a scrubber system that will prevent chlorine from being released to the environment.  The OWD has also implemented an Emergency Response Plan and conducts drills with the Fire Department and County of San Diego HMD to ensure proper response and coordination in the event of a release of chlorine.\n\nThis RMP and CalARP Program documents all of the required information and provides a summary of the OWD's plans and programs to manage risks associated with the handling of chlorine at the Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility."
