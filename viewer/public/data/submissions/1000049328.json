Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BRADLEY NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant, located at 4065 County Street 2970, Bradley OK 73011in Grady County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration compression to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas-primarily methane-and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n    \n\n?    Condensate Flash Tank PV-0130, comprised primarily of methane-plus (NGL) mixture\n\n    \n\nThis process vessel was selected due to having t"

It is noteworthy that the Bradley Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this Program Level 3 Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the methane-plus NGL mixture.  For the Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory capacity (100% maximum tank capacity of 92,560 gallons) of this tank are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.61 miles or 3,244 feet.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant.\n\n    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant is a VCE resulting from a release of 114,889 pounds of ethane-plus NGL mixture over a sixty (60) minute period, resulting from a seal failure at the NGL Pipeline Pumps, P-302A/B/C.  This hypothetical release is expected to be isolated by an operator in less than sixty minutes.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.39 miles or 2,072 feet.  This event was selected as being the most statistically credible scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Although the Bradley Natural Gas Processing"

Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n    \n\nEmployee Participation\n\n    \n\nThe Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Operations personnel also participate in the development and review of operating procedures, process safety information (PSI), and training and mentoring of other personnel.\n\n    \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n    \n\nThe Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant develops a"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n    \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.
