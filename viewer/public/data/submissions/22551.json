This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Marshall County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Plymouth Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that is used as Packaging material. We have a flammable mixture of Butane/isobutane present at our facility. These regulated substances are used as a blowing agent at our facility.\n\nThe maximum inventory of the flammable mixture at our facility is 111000 Ibs. This consist of a blend of Isobutane and Butane\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and alterative release scenario, we have used equations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) RMP*Comp (TM). The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a catastrophic release from the Butane/Isobutane flammable mixture storage tanks. The scenario involves the release of 111000 Ibs. of of the flammable mixture. Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have not been considered"

For this scenario, it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under the worst case weather conditions, the consequence distance from the explosion of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) is 0.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a release of butane from an overfilled storage tank. The scenario involves the release of 9700 lb. of butane which is assumed to result in a pool fire. The maximum distance from the center of the pool where people can potentially receive second degree bums from a 40-second exposure is 0.10 miles.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit IDT099-5696-00028 from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
