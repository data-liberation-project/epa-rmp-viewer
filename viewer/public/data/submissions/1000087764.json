The management and employees of the Linde Wacker facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Hydrogen.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA.  \n\nThe facility's primary- operation is the storage and distribution of hydrogen to Wacker Polysilicon North America, LLC. There is one covered PSM/RMP process or regulated substance-liquid storage and distribution of Hydrogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nOur safety, health and environmental policy calls for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment.  This policy is the basis for engineering, construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Hydrogen. The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation. Employees will serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They will be frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n\n\n\nWritten process safety information has been developed for the Hydrogen system.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA for the Hydrogen system will be updated at least every 5 years.  Detailed operating procedures have been developed by"

      "SummaryText": " employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise and knowledge of the process.  The procedures have been reviewed at a minimum annually and revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\n\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained.  A contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public. Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) will be used for new or modified processes.  An on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Hazardous work or nonroutine work will be controlled in a consistent manner. The hazards identified will be communicated to those performing the work including safe practices for hot work. Management of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent and or temporary changes made to the process. \n\nThe facility will have an emergency preparedness/response plan. The Emergency Action plan outlines what actions employees are to take if there is a release of Hydrogen and is integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued periodically to ensure that it is current. \n\nSafety improvement are an on-going process at the facility.  There are no additional specific Hydrogen safety recommendations for implementation at this time\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accident reportable under the RMP regulation in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nAs a part of this five-year re-submittal, it was determined in 2015 the Alternative Release Scenario should have been reported as 85 lbs in 5 minutes (or 17 lbs/min for 5 minutes).  The endpoint distance is still the same, 0.03 miles. In addition when the correction was made in 2018, line item 7.4.a. Date of last PHA or PHA update was entered as"
