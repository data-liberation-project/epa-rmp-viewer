We are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures are needed.\n\nDescription of the Facility Information and Regulated Substances handled\n\n(b)\tFXI-Foamex Innovations, Inc. is located at 154 Lipford Rd in the Lee Industrial Park South in Verona, MS.  The facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, primarily for the furniture and bedding industry, and handles mixed isomers of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  TDI is regulated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments.\n\nThe same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance. TDI is considered a toxic substance and associated safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as fire, explosion, or toxic release of TDI is possible. \n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Specific Prevention Steps\n\n(c)\tFXI uses this RMP and FXI best management practices as the primary programs for defining and guiding the Accidental Release Prevention Program for the facility.  The facility has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Program (Level 2) due to the following factors:\n\t1.\tTDI is listed on CAA 112(r) and our process"

Consequently, our covered process is not subject to Program Level 3.\n\nOur accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following seven (7) functions:\n\n\t1.\tControl the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment.\n\t2.\tConduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, process, and procedures.\n\t3.\tCreate, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that used regulated substances.\n\t4. \tProvide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs.\n\t5.\tMonitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes.\n\t6.\tConfirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule.\n\t7.\tEnsure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the company to help prevent recurrence.\n\nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities. Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n\t\n\tThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination included participation in periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives. The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency organizations such as the fire department.  This provided a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an accident.  The plant also conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local Fire Department and emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n(f)\tWe strive to continuously improve the safety of our plant TDI process through periodic safety reviews and a program of soliciting proactive safety suggestions from employees.  Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the processes.  The following change"

      "SummaryText": "s are currently planned for implementation:\n        1.\tMagnetic Site gauge cleaning for our two indoor tanks has been added to our preventative maintenance procedures.  This will allow the gauges to provide to reliable level detection before any contamination inside the magnetic gauge could occur and lead to an overfill condition or an inaccuracy in measuring the TDI in-house inventory for the facility.\n\t2.\tAdditional magnetic site gauges are planned on both of our indoor tanks to give redundant readings.  This will further assist in determining if a magnetic gauge has developed a problem before an accident or an inventory inaccuracy occurs.\n        3.\tAdditional protection using a remotely controlled outdoor camera is planned to further enhance our quick detection capabilities in the event of a release of TDI or other chemical being unloaded.\n        4.\tLiquid Flow detection in the tank vent systems is planned to provide a  form of quick detection which could also automatically stop a liquid release resulting from an overfill condition."
