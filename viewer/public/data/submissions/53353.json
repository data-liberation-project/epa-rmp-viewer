      "SummaryText": "New Jersey - American Water Company is New Jersey's largest private water utility, providing drinking water to over 300,000 people.  To disinfect this water, New Jersey - American uses chlorine gas and ozone.  In order to protect our neighbors New Jersey - American has had a comprehensive written risk management program in place for over 10 years.  Furthermore, NJAWC has recently installed a chlorine scrubber that has the capacity to neutralize 1 liquid ton of chlorine. This program addresses all aspects of process safety from operations to emergency response.\n\nThe program starts with employee training at NJAWC.  A new employee must first meet the basic job requirements before they are even considered for a job handling hazardous chemicals.  After an individual is accepted into a position they undergo 90 days of on-the-job and classroom training.  During the entire training process, written and verbal tests are administered to highlight any deficiencies in the training progress.  At the end of this training period a comprehensive verbal test is administered to evaluate the associate.  All associates continually attend annual refresher training to maintain their skills and knowledge.\n\nStandard operating procedures (SOPS) have been developed for all processes involving chlorine and ozone.  These procedures are taken directly from manufacturer's equipment manuals or recognized industry standards. The SOPs describe the normal operation of the equipment, any abnormal conditions and the response to this type of condition in order to bring the equipment back into normal operating parameters.  All employees are trained on the SOPs and review them annually.   \n\nA comprehensive preventive maintenance program exists at NJAWC in order to assure the proper operation of the equipment.   Every piece of chlorine and ozone equipment is included in the PM program.  Equipment is inspected and maintained on a schedule based on manufacturer's recommendations or industry standards.  In t"

      "SummaryText": "he absence of any written recommendations all equipment is inspected on an annual basis.  Employees responsible for maintenance are trained on procedures before they are allowed to perform any work on the equipment.\n\nA hazard analysis is conducted every 5 years to determine if there are any realistic release scenarios for the site.  This analysis evaluates every possible leak location and what protective measures are in place or could be implemented to prevent such a release. The hazard analysis is done with individuals who are familiar with the equipment and work with it on a daily basis under the guidance of a Production Manager. Recommendations are reviewed internally for implementation. \n\nAny change in policy, procedures and equipment goes through an exhaustive review before implementation.  This review insures that all aspects of the change are studied and understood before any modification of the system is undertaken.  Corrections are made to SOPs, drawings, emergency response and training before the change is implemented to insure that all operations are done properly with the new equipment.  A procedure is also in place to guarantee that there is always someone in charge of the RMP program in the event of supervisory changes in NJAWC.  \n\nIn the rare event that despite the above procedures there is a leak or release of chlorine or ozone employees at NJAWC are trained in emergency response actions.   Individuals first go to 40 hours of training in emergency response and chemical hazards.  This training includes instruction on the proper personal protective equipment and tools to stop a release.  Employees then attend an 8-hr. refresher class ever year to keep their skills sharp.   Drills are held annually in to insure that the emergency response program works as it is designed.  The drills are evaluated and if corrective actions needed they are implemented.  The plan is distributed to the local emergency planning committees (LEPC) and they are invited to atten"

The accident investigation is conducted by the responsible manager who will follow-up on any corrective actions necessary.      \n\nThe risk management program is formally audited annually to insure that there are no deviations from all the policies and procedures involved in the handling of chlorine and ozone.\n\n\nThere have not been any chlorine or ozone releases at the facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\nThe facility is currently installing one change to further improve safety at the facility.  A scrubber is being installed that is designed to treat chlorine vapors before they are released to the atmosphere."
