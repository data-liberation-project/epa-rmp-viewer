It is located one mile southwest of Gordonsville in Louisa County, Virginia.  The facility, nominally rated at a 240 MW capacity, has two duel fuel-fired combustion turbines and heat recovery steam generators with supplementary duct burners.  Each unit is equipped with dry low nitrogen oxides (NOx) combustors, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), and water injection in order to comply with NOx emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's NOx CAIR, as implemented through Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule (9 VAC 5 Chapter 140) and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  One hazardous material is stored in a reportable quantity, 29.4% aqueous ammonia.  The SCR process injects aqueous ammonia into the flue gas stream, where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of aqueous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is stored at the facility in a 25,000 gallon tank limited to 80% of maximum capacity (~20,000 gallons) through administrative controls.  The tank, piping system, and safety devices are designed and constructed to comply with applicable federal codes and regulations.  The tank is enclosed by a concrete berm and contains chemical sensors to detect small releases.  The tank is also equipped with other safety devices: pressure/vacuum relief valve set at 12 psig / 3 oz/in. sq., and level indicators.\n\n\n\nGordonsville Power Station has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program. Gordonsville Power Station's operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of aqueous ammonia.  In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is furt"

      "SummaryText": "her trained in emergency operations.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, and piping system.  These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Furthermore, Gordonsville Power Station ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur.  Gordonsville Power Station has taken great care to ensure the aqueous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.  Chemical safety training through first aid, emergency contingency plans, Hazard Communication, and PPE programs reinforce the criticality of chemical safety to operations personnel.  Operations personnel conduct inspections on every day to minimize the consequences of potential leaks or process problems. The emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility.  Gordonsville Power Station has a qualified contracting agency on standby that will respond to chemical spills and cleanup operations, and we have confirmed our inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nGordonsville Power Station has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does have an emergency response plan which meets OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER) and accidental releases are expected to be corrected immediately by employees of Gordonsville Power Station.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Louisa County's local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  In the event of a release, the plan includes immediate notifications to local responding agencies, state and federal agencies, and plant management.  The plan also includes evacuation procedures"
