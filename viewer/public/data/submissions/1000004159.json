      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power CompanyA?s Plant Miller, located near Porter, Alabama, is a 4 unit steam electric generating plant.\n\nIt is the policy of Plant Miller to provide and maintain safe and healthful working conditions and to implement and adhere to operating practices that will safeguard all employees, resulting in safe working conditions, and an efficient and environmentally safe operation.  The plant has a safety program designed to ensure that the employeesA? working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instruction.\n\nPlant Miller has two (2) cooling towers to help reduce the temperature of the water that is discharged into the Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River.  In order to treat the water prior to returning to the river, chlorine is injected into the cooling tower system.  A 1 ton cylinder of chlorine is attached to a manifold at each cooling tower for this purpose.  Additional cylinders are kept as spares in this location.  The total quantity of chlorine on-site exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 lbs.\n\nPlant Miller also has a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system at each of the 4 units to control the emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning coal to produce electricity. As part of the system, vaporous ammonia is injected into the flue gas and aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to harmless nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on the plant site for use in the SCR system.  The total quantity of ammonia on-site exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs.\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) program under OSHA is in effect for Plant Miller, therefore Program 3 applies.\n\nThe hazard that would be associated with the chlorine at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard.  The most likely event is a leaking of the manifold attached to the cylinder.  The cylinders are protected from traffic around the plant by open-sided steel framed sheds.  When it is necessary to replace empty cylinders, trained personnel remove and conne"

Therefore, a rupture that would result in the rapid release of the gas is unlikely.\n\nThe main hazard that would be associated with anhydrous ammonia at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard.  The Degadis model was used to determine the worst case scenario for the release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nPlant Miller did not exceed the threshold amount for flammables.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at Plant Miller is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system and the use of chlorine used on the two cooling towers.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: accessibility, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations are conducted including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\nPlant Miller is included in the Birmingham/Jefferson County LEPC emergency response plan.  In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia or chlorine.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan, recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm systems; training; and pre-emergency coordination with the Jefferson County LEPC.\n"
