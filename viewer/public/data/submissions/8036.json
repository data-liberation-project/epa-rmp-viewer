Chlorine equipment and related procedures are designed to maintain the safe handling and use of chlorine.  In the Fort Madison WTP five-year accident history, no off-site accidental releases of chlorine have occurred.\n\nChlorine is stored in quantities up to 8,000 pounds in a Program 3 process.  The Fort Madison WTP operates with two chlorine ton containers connected to the chlorine manifold.  Also, located in close proximity are two additional ton containers.  The chlorine process, as defined under RMP requirements, includes vessels that are interconnected and co-located.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that 2000 pounds of chlorine are released from a ton container as a gas in a ten minute period.  However, the release rate of chlorine from the chlorine building is estimated to be 55% if the release rate from the container due to the passive mitigation of the chlorine building.  The released plume is estimated to travel 0.9 miles before no longer posing a hazard to the public.\n\nThe alternative scenario assumes the release of chlorine from a ton container due to a valve failure, bad flexible tubing connection, or flexible tubing failure.  Any of these events could release chlorine gas  through the 5/16 inch diameter valve body opening.  Over a 60 minute period, 318 pounds of chlorine are estimated to be released.  This release is predicted to travel 0.31 miles before no longer posing a hazard to the public.\n\nThe Fort Madison WTP uses a variety of equipment and procedures to prevent accidental releases.   The process is a vacuum system for gas feed of the chlorine.  Among this equipment are monitors to detect releases, vacuum regulators on the chlorine flow from the chlorine containers, the chlorine building with its fire prevention design, and chlorine containers in conformance with ASME code.  Procedures include the safe storage of chlorine containers, periodic inspe"

These procedrues and more have been developed through the OSHA PSM abd RMP Program 3 requirements.\n\nRecent chlorine process equipment replacements at the Fort Madison WTP signficantly improve the potential for safe plant opertions.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Fort Madison WTP has coordinated and pre-planned response activities with offsite responders.  Fort Madison WTP employees will evacuate the site and notify these responders according to the Fairfield WTP emergency action plan."
