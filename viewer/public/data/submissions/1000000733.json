If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the New Albany Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a mushroom fertilizer manufacturer.  We blend and package soy flour by products treated with formaldehyde for delayed nutrient release.  The formaldehyde is stored in a 4100 gallon capacity tank. The tank is located in a diked building adjacent to the main warehouse.  The normal maximum fill is 3600 gals.\n\nOur worst case scenario is tank failure resulting in full release.  The release rate to outside air would be .00323 pounds per minute - much lower that the lowest amount allowed to enter in submit program.  And the estimated distance to toxic endpoint would be .1 miles.  Even though topography would be considered urban it is a very sparsely populated area to the endpoint.  \n\nOur alternate release scenario is a .5 square inch hole or puncture in the tank leading to a 5 minute release.  The release rate would be even lower at .00277 and estimated distance to endpoint is same as worst case.\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable accident prevention codes and regulations.  The formaldehyde system was designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with all recommendations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving formaldehyde.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the formaldehyde, it is our policy to notify the New Albany Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our facility.  We also notify the Floyd County LEPC."
