Senior management's commitment to safety has been made evident by a number of safety policies and procedures which have become the basis of our company's \"safety first\" ethic.  The company safety policy includes a section on proper procedures concerning the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  An extension of this policy is the risk management plan, which has been implemented at Wheeler Brothers Grain Company's Kingfisher, Oklahoma facility to provide a contingency plan in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Due to the nature and inherent dangers associated with anhydrous ammonia, this plan has been developed to prevent accidental release through responsible handling and proper storage of the product, ensure proper training and safety equipment are provided for our employees, and to make the surrounding community aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\n\n\nWheeler Brother's Kingfisher facility is primarily a grain elevator as well as a fertilizer and chemical dealership.  The only regulated substance which qualifies under the Clean Air Act of 1990 in quantities above the minimum threshold is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient.  Two 11,000 gallon storage tanks are located at this site which never contains anhydrous ammonia at more than 85% of capacity.  Anhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas and liquid (liquid under pressure).  The vapor is toxic and irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and skin.  It may cause a running nose, coughing, chest pain, cessation of respiration and death if inhaled.  Anhydrous ammonia is toxic and may be fatal if large amounts are absorbed through the skin.  Skin exposure to high concentrations of the gas may cause burning and blistering.  Contact with liquid may cause severe s"

      "SummaryText": "kin burns.  Exposure to the eyes may cause temporary or permanent blindness.  Also, anhydrous ammonia is harmful to aquatic life in very low concentrations and may be hazardous if it enters water intakes.  Ammonia does not concentrate in the food chain, therefore the hazards to wildlife are limited to acute exposures similar to humans.\n\n\n\nWheeler Brother's accidental release prevention program at the Kingfisher location falls under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards at 29 CFR 1910.111 for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  This facility has also implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,      \n\n K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.  Maintaining our facilities, equipment and employee training program in accordance with these guidelines is merely a starting point.  We have taken additional steps to prevent accidental releases.  These include the installation of valve locks and a security fence around the storage tank and fill station to prevent unauthorized access.  Also, all nurse tanks are stored in a fenced area to prevent theft and vandalism.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at this location in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAs part of our emergency response program, this facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\nand has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  Our policy is that we are a non-responder in that we do not provide HAZMAT training to any of our employees nor do we expect them to respond to an accidental release other than the"

      "SummaryText": " steps outlined in our emergency action plan.  Each year prior to anhydrous ammonia season, all employees that have direct contact with anhydrous ammonia, receive training at our annual anhydrous safety meeting.  Items covered include:  proper starting and stopping procedures, emergency shutdown and protocol, use of personal protective equipment, safe handling and first-aid.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations and/or drills are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and safety procedures.  In 2003 Wheeler Brothers participated in a FEMA sponsored  \"Comprehensive HAZMAT Emergency Response-Capability Assessment Program\" (CHER-CAP) exercise at our Canton, Oklahoma location.   The final phase of the exercise was a full-scale response, by emergency personnel, to a mock disaster involving an anhydrous ammonia release similar to the worst-case scenario depicted in Section 2 of our Risk Management Plan.  The objective of this exercise was to expose planning shortfalls and to co-ordinate with local emergency responders to improve their ability to respond to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This drill provided training for emergency responders covering our Watonga, Canton and Greenfield, Oklahoma locations.  Our future goal is to participate in similar drills at all of our locations handling anhydrous ammonia\n\n\n\n     \n\n    \n\n"
