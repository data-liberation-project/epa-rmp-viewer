The only chemical on-site exceeding the Federal Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The following Executive Summary covers Release Prevention, Immediate Notification & Evacuation, Emergency Response Protocols & Clean-up Procedures, Worst & Alternate Case Scenarios, Compliance, and New Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention:\n\n      The main storage area is elevated from ground level by a concrete slab, fenced and covered. It is located away from the operation and separated from drains, gutters, property lines, roads, alleys, etc. Materials are supplied by the suppliers in proper containers clearly marked with proper warnings against hazards and instructions on how to handle the product. The products are stored at designated areas for each product to eliminate the likelihood of delivering and using the wrong material for the wrong purpose.\n      The other smaller storage areas, as designated on the site map are located close the place of usage and are also elevated from ground level by concrete slabs, fenced and covered. The person in charge Heriberto Castro delivers materials from the main storage area to the storage areas as they are needed.\n      Purchasing agent (Jack Ventura) takes inventory on a weekly basis and at the same time inspects the containers for leaks, seepage, drainage and general housekeeping. Materials are transferred from one container to smaller containers in accordance with manufacturer recommendations or industry standards. The purchasing agent obtains this information from suppliers as the materials are purchased. The purchasing agent is in charge of supervision and training of the employees handling the materials.\n\n      Training includes the following:\n\n            1.Use of equipment\n            2.Ha"

When evacuation of employees is required for their safety, the supervisor of the area will instruct his employees to evacuate. The evacuation routes have been mapped out on the site plan, utilizing emergency exits, routing to the staging area located at the parking lot to the west of the main office. Employees are not to remain calm and not to run. Following evacuation, supervisors will determine if their personnel have all been accounted for and report to the office.\n      Immediate reporting is not required if there is a reasonable belief that the release poses no significant present or potential hazard to human health and safety, property, or the environment.\n      The maintenance supervisor will assign maintenance personnel to shut off utilities before evacuation. These employees are to approach shut-offs with caution, and not endanger themselves to shut off the mains.\n      Following shutoff, each person will follow the nearest evacuation route to the staging area."
