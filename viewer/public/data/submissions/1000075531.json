Within the past five years, the process(es) has (have) had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process(es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.

The program consists of procedures for safely responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency action response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a flammable release occurs. Company personnel are also available to assess post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency action response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency action response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary and is based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Enable Midstream Partners gas plant facilities.\r\n\t\r\nThe overall emergency action program for the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Roger Mills County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\t\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\t\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at the Roger Mills Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\t\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant has safety features on many systems to help: (1) contain/control an unintentional release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of an unintentional release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\t\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\u00bf\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms and shutdowns\r\n\u00bf\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\r\n\u00bf\tPlant is on a 24-hour Gas Control callout system\r\n\t\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\u00bf\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a safe location.\r\n\u00bf\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n\u00bf\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature, high level).\r\n\u00bf\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptable power supply for process control system).\r\n\u00bf\tAtmospheric relief devices.\r\n\t\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\u00bf\tFire extinguishers.\r\n\u00bf\tPersonnel trained in company emergency action procedures.\r\n\u00bf\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant has an excellent record of accidental release prevention.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\t\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\t\r\nEnable Midstream promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n\t\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\t\r\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\t\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\t\r\nEnable Midstream has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each Operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\t\r\nContractors\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
