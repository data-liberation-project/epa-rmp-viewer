If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Pike Township and Indianapolis Fire Departments and the Marion County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service. Medical emergencies will require notification of Pike Township Fire Department EMS Division via 911 for ambulance service. The primary hospital response is provided through St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital (Level II Trauma Center). The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency. \r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Zionsville Terminal is a refined product storage and distribution Terminal, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the gasoline truck rack lines). The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including one horizontal storage vessel and the associated piping, one blending skid, a single sample analyzer along with a gasoline fast loop, and one truck off-loading point.\r\n\r\nThe Facility's worst case scenario is the complete failure of one liquefied butane vessel filled to 85% capacity (automatic shut-off limited) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site and includes both public and limited environmental receptors. The Facility's alternate (potential to impact off-site populations) scenario is a BLEVE involving storage vessel. The resulting distance to endpoint extends off-site and affects both public receptors and limited environmental receptors.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Zionsvill"

Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119). \r\n\r\nThis Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane blending system resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Zionsville Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Pike Township Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Pike Township Fire Department and the Marion County LEPC. The Pike Township Fire Department is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.  The Zionsville Terminal maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the butane vessels.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\r\n\r\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety. Also, Buckeye is considering a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles."
