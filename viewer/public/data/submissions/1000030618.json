The site has 19 employees.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant is covered by EPA RMP regulations and subject to OSHA PSM standard. The summary below discusses the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAt the Washington Plant, employees are expected to participate in accidental release prevention program (PSM/RMP). Plant employees are trained on and provided access to the plant Process Safety Information.  The specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan.  The employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed. The employees are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe Washington Plant keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters.  The PSI provides key operating limit information to the process operating procedures.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified an"

Local and corporate management review the PHA team findings and a resolution action plan for each item is documented, tracked and ultimately closed in tracking system.  The most recent revalidation of the Washington CO2 plant ammonia refrigeration process PHA was completed in June of 2016. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Washington CO2 Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of ammonia refrigeration process operations, such as (1) Unit Startup, (2) Unit Normal Operation Procedures, (3) Unit Shut-Down, (4) Emergency Shutdown, and (5) Startup following an Emergency Shutdown.  These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the CO2 Plant's ammonia refrigeration process. All employees receive training on plant orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and the emergency response plan.  In addition all operators are required to attend periodic refresher training. Training is documented locally and in the Matheson electronic document system. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant uses contractors to supplement its own work force when maintenance activities exceed the capabilities or time available for their own operators.

Once contractors are approved, they are periodically evaluated to insure that both their safety performance and training required for work on the Washington CO2 plant meet the safety standards of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Matheson Pre-startup Safety review (PSSRs) program is intended to re-enforce process safe through the review and confirmation of: (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; (2) safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; (3) process hazard analyses (PHAs) have been performed and recommendations resolved before startup of new plants or processes; (4) management of change (MOC) requirements have been satisfied for modified facilities; and (5) training has been completed for affected employees.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant has established a preventative maintenance program with procedure and interval frequencies for the PSM covered process equipment and associated systems to inspect, test and maintain the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration process as a whole.  The Mechanical Integrity program provides for the verification of suitability of new and/or modification of existing equipment, as well as, the quality control of spare parts.\n\n\n\nSafe and Hot Work permit system\n\nThe Washington CO2 plant has a safe and hot work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
