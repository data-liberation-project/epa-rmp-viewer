Through review and analysis of the following elements, BTQCL-Escalon Cellars has examined methods to reduce the likelihood that employees or the community may be exposed to hazardous chemicals due to catastrophic release:\n\n\n\nElement 1: Hazardous Chemical Process Review - examined the hazardous chemicals employed, mechanical systems' integrity and design, employee training, standard operating procedures, and auditing and inspection techniques employed.\n\n\n\nElement 2: Hazard Analysis Techniques - examined the potential hazards present, consequences of the failure of engineering controls, human factors, and failure siting. The \"What If\" technique was chosen and employed for this purpose.\n\n\n\nElement 3: Review of Past Accidental Releases and Consequences.\n\n\n\nElement 4: Off-site Hazard Assessment - determined the off-site impacts of release based on worst-case and alternative release scenario analyses. The vulnerable zones for the release covered by highly hazardous chemicals were estimated using the PMP*Comp modeling program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe BTQCL-Escalon Cellars is located at 21801 Highway 120, in Escalon, California, which is approximately 8.2 miles east of the 99 Freeway.\n\n\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and/or Cal-EMA's CalARP requirements are typically triggered by manufacturing, handling, using, storing, processing, or on-site movement of certain quantities (referred to as threshold quantities) of chemicals deemed as hazardous. At the BTQCL-Escalon Cellars facility, anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide are the regulated substances. Anhydrous ammonia is employed as a refrigerant in a closed-loop process. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approxima"

The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide is approximately 4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nThrough hazard analysis techniques, BTQCL-Escalon Cellars has updated and refined its standard operating procedures and process and instrumentation diagrams for all covered processes under RMP requirements. This information has been employed for providing more comprehensive training and a better understanding by operators.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history showed that there have been no releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide that exceeded the federal reportable quantities during the five year accident period: October 2009 to October 2014. In addition, there was one injury resulting from an ammonia release.  There were no injuries due to sulfur dioxide release. Six reports of ammonia vapor caused internal incident investigations.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nBTQCL-Escalon Cellar's Emergency Planning and Response Program is included in the winery's Hazardous Materials Management Plan.  For emergency release of hazardous materials, employees have been instructed to evacuate the area and notify their supervisor. The supervisor will assess the situation and notify the in-house emergency response team and the local fire department to respond, if warranted.\n\n\n\nThe local fire department can contact the Ripon HAZMAT Team to respond to hazardous material releases in a safe and timely manner. The local fire department is invited to tour the winery's hazardous material storage areas.\n\n\n\nEmployees are notified to evacuate by: 1) winery siren, 2) verbal instructions, and/or 3) two-way radio communication.\n\n\n\nIt is primarily the Safety Manager's responsibility to make the proper notifications in case of an emergency release.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe BTQCL - Esc"
