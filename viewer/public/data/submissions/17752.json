Ammonia, which is used in the process handling of vegetables\nis the AHM of concern and the focus of this study Eckert Cold Storage utilizes two refrigeration systems that contain a total of 27,600 pounds of ammonia. Both systems are closed systems that\ncycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. \nThese systems have a low pressure low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates,\nand a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant gives off heat as it is condensed back to a liquid. ( In operation the system basically moves heat from  the low side to the high side.) Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulating enclosure where goods are processed, chilled, or frozen.\nEckert Cold Storage Company has operated in Escalon since 1996, there has not been a release of\nammonia in the three years of operation.\n Eckert cold Storage company annually trains their employees.  The training includes\noperating procedures emergency response, prevention programs, and the business emergency\naction plan."
