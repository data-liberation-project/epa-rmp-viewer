      "SummaryText": "Clorox Products Manufacturing Company, Aberdeen, MD\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Clorox Products Manufacturing Company, (Clorox) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment has led us to develop a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on site to control and mitigate its effects.  We have coordinated our emergency procedures with the Harford County LEPC and the Aberdeen Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\nTo learn more about The Clorox Company please visit our web page at:  WWW.CLOROX.COM.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity involves the manufacture of Clorox household cleaning products.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility -- chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the production of sodium hypochlorite, which is the active ingredient in Clorox bleach.\n\nThe largest single container of chlorine at our facility is 180,000 pounds -- the capacity of the railcar in which the chlorine is received.  The covered process at this facility as defined by the EPA is the chlorine handling system that includes storage and use of this regulated substance in the production of sodium hypochlorite.\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 by the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  Our chlorine handl"

Our facility is also subject to the notification requirements of Section 302 of the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\nControl Systems\nOur facility manufacturing systems are designed with multiple safety features to avoid any problems that could be caused by failure of a specific device or control system.  The automatic portion of our normal bleach facility operations are designed for \"fail-safe\" operation in the event of a control system failure or a power outage.  Critical functions are additionally protected by battery back-ups.  Finally, we have over-riding controls that are hard-wired to an emergency stop (\"E-stop\") system.  This E-stop system is also designed for fail-safe operation, and it requires manual intervention to reset and start the system.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nClorox maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazardous Operability Studies (HazOps).  The study is conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Per EPA and OSHA requirements, the HazOp is revalidated at least every five years or whenever the process is significantly changed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorine handling process, Clorox maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, operations (normal and emergency), and shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operat"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually or more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nClorox carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Clorox to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start-up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Clorox.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nClorox conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Although EPA required that these audits are conducted every three years, Clorox audits its chlorine-handling f"

Corrective actions resulting from the audit findings are addressed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nClorox promptly investigates any incident associated with the chlorine process, including false alarms and potential and actual releases of chlorine regardless of the quantity.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nClorox believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Clorox has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractorA?s work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of chlorine occur.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nClorox has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release as defined by the EPA during this period at this facility or any similar Clorox facilities across the United States.  \n\n5.
