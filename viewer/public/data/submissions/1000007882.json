The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Trupointe Cooperative, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A?Storage And Handling Of Anhydrous AmmoniaA?.  The facility has also complied with the A?Regulations For Storing And Handling Fertilizer Anhydrous AmmoniaA? as regulated by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.\n\n\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.  The release was due to attempted theft of product during early morning hours.  To our knowledge, there were no offsite injuries or property damage.  Several houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  Since the release, additional security measures have been implemented to prevent future thefts.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know info"
