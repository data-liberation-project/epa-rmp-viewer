If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Star Volunteer Fire Department as well as the Mongtomery County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the First Health Ambulance Company and Montgomery Memorial Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to small the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Texon, L.P. - Star Terminal is a butane transfer facility (specifically, rail car to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank (railcar).\n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the transfer system's one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.4 miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenario is a pull away accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends to 0.01 miles but does not effect public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe Texon, L.P. - Star Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Aministration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

The facility currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate departments include Biscoe and Troy) and the Montgomery LEPC.  The Star Volunteer Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system."
