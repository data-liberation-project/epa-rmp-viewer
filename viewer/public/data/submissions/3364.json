However, the maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia which may be stored is 4,300 pounds. Therefore, Anhydrous Ammonia is not regulated.\n\nThe Maximum quantity of Chlorine which may be stored is 16,000 pounds.  Chlorine is regulated by 40 CFR 68 \u0016 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nCarroll \u0016 Boone Water District certifies that they have had no reportable accidents within the last five (5) years.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered is a full 2,000 pound container of chlorine released in 10 minutes.  The distance to worst-case toxic endpoint is 2.23 miles.  Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/outside air \u0016 shed w/1 side open\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered, is a full 2,000 pound container released through a broken 5/16 inch container valve in 133 minutes.  The distance to alternative toxic endpoint is 0.20 miles. Calculations by RMP Comp with Mitigation considered is that containers are in enclosed space in direct contact w/outside air \u0016 shed w/1 side open.\n\nThere are public receptors, residencies and U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Recreation Areas, within the worst case toxic end point.  Therefore CBWD Freeman \u0016 Raney Water Treatment Plant Program Level is Program 2.\n\nThe Program 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program is directed toward reduction of the probability of accidental releases of chlorine at this location.  The program addresses management, the adequacy of chlorination equipment and operator proficiency to eliminate or reduce such accidental chlorine releases.\n\nThe Freeman \u0016 Raney Water Treatment Plant is included in the"
