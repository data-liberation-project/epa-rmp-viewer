This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Semi-conductor grade hydrochloric acid and zinc diakyldithiophosphates.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride], Hydrogen and Furan.  Chlorine is used for Making hydrochloric acid..  Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] is used for shipments to customers.  Hydrogen is used for  making hydrochloric acid .  Furan is used for making pyrrole and n-methyl pyrrole.                                       .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 180000.00 lb. while Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride], Hydrogen and Furan are present at our facility in quantities of 157500.00 lb., 100000.00 lb. and 40000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.
