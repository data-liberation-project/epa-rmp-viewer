In the event of an emergency, the operator can use one of these buttons to shut off the ammonia flow.

There is no containment around the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Programs\r\n\r\nOperational and preventative maintenance programs are in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the ammonia ammonia processes at the facility to ensure workplace and off-site receptor safety.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nPhibro-Tech facility has not had an accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Phibro-Tech has an emergency plan in effect at the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.

The process that uses the regulated substance is the Aqueous Ammonia Etchant System.  \r\n\r\nAqueous Ammonia Etchant System:\r\n\r\nThe facility stores a maximum of 58,000 pounds (10,200 gallons) of anhydrous ammonia in the bulk anhydrous ammonia tank. The facility also stores etchant product solution that is an aqueous solution of ammonia (concentration is less than 20 percent). ns. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, water, carbon dioxide (CO2), and other additives are combined with ammonium chloride solutions in mix tanks (reactor vessels) to produce product (etchant). The process is a batch process. The ammonium chloride solutions are produced in the cupric chloride and copper ammonium chloride systems elsewhere in the facility. The product solutions created in the mix tanks are transferred to storage tanks for holding. These solutions are then transferred to drum, totes and tankers for shipment to customers. Prior to filling, all drums and totes are washed to remove the remains of prior etchant solutions. A scrubbing system removes ammonia vapors from the exhaust of all process vents. A system of ammonia sensors is in the process area and at strategic locations along the fence line to detect accidental releases of ammonia. A process logic controller, in conjunction with various sensors, interlocks, and the electronically controlled anhydrous ammonia valves, ensures safe operation of the process.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Phibro-Tech facility, including each chemical recovery system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of chemical recovery systems. These safety features include ammonia sensors, automatic shutdown buttons, and scrubbers, each of which is described below.\r\n  \r\nAmmonia Detectors\r\n\r\nThe ammonia sensors ar"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.)\tTo save lives.\r\n2.)\tTo minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.)\tTo protect the environment.\r\n4.)\tTo minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nPhibro-Tech maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, anhydrous and aqueous ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia process at Phibro-Tech is a Program Level 3 process under PSM, RMP, and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP). \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Phibro-Tech facility is located at 8851 Dice Road in Santa Fe Springs, California.
