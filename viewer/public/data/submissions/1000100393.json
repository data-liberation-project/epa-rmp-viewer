The facility is part of Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag), headquartered in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Brenntag is an advanced distribution company serving customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials. The company ranks among the top chemical distribution firms in North America. \n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to handle materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk. This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution program of the Association of Chemical Distributors (ACD). The Community Outreach and Emergency Response Plan of Responsible Distribution brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communication and cooperative emergency planning. It is also company policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. \n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC Chicago facility is located at 4801 South Austin Ave. in an unincorporated area of Stickney Township, near Chicago, in Cook County, Illinois. Brenntag employs approximately 42 people at this location. The primary purpose of this facility is the distribution (including repackaging and storage) of industrial and fine chemicals. The regulated processes at this location include the storage and distribution of \"factory-filled containers\" of Cyclohexylamine and lsopropylamine, and the repackaging and storage of Aqua Ammonia. These chemicals are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are distributed to numerous customers who utilize these compounds for many \napplications ranging from water treatment, other chemical manufacturing, to pharmaceutical applications. The same properties that make these chemicals valuable, also makes"

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. \nIn accordance with the RMP Submit User\u0092s Manual 2004, the following elements and their descriptions have been included in this Executive Summary:\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBrenntag -is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as; design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the various processes at the facility. It is Brenntag's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Brenntag has thoroughly coordinated response efforts with the Local Fire Dept., which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Brenntag facility's primary activities encompass distribution of chemical products. There are currently three (3) regulated substances present at the facility. These substances include Cyclohexylamine, lsopropylamine and Aqua Ammonia. The Cyclohexylamine and lsopropylamine are received prepackaged and are only handled for resell to customers and the containers are normally not opened on site. Aqua ammonia is repackaged from a DOT \"in-transit\" tanker truck to DOT totes.\n\n3. \tWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.

      "SummaryText": "CFR Part 68) 3/09 was used as a guideline for determining the worst-case release for each of the regulated substances.\nThe weight of the volume of liquid contained in the largest container of each regulated substance was used to determine the release rate. LFA, LFB and DF values were taken from Exhibit 4-5a tables. A temperature correction factor (Exhibit 4-6) was chosen for a temperature of 101 deg F, which is the highest daily maximum temperature for the local vicinity over the past five years. A non\u00addiked pool was calculated to be 224 square feet assuming the spilled liquid forms a 1 cm deep pool. This information was used, along with Exhibits provided in the guidance manual, in order to determine the distance to the endpoint. Based on site topography and satellite photos of the surrounding area, an urban topography was chosen for this facility. \nThe worst-case release calculations for isopropylamine indicate that there are no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint. This, in addition to no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the last five years, classifies this process as a Program Level 1 regulated substances. As such, an alternative release scenario (ARS) is not required. \n\nThe worst-case release calculations for cyclohexylamine and aqua ammonia indicate that there are potential public (industrial) receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint. This, in addition to no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the last five years, classifies both of these processes as a Program Level 2 regulated substances. Alternative release scenarios (ARS)'s were calculated for each chemical and resulted in less of the distance to the toxic endpoints than the worst-case scenarios. \n\n4. \tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps The Brenntag facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of th"
