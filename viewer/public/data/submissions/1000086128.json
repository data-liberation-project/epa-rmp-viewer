      "SummaryText": "The Mennel Milling Company of Michigan operates a large mill in Dowagiac, Michigan, that processes wheat into many\ndifferent grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour to achieve a\ndesired pH. In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to inhibit microbial\ngrowth.\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton containers. The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the\nsite via truck. The containers are unloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the use of an overhead crane rail hoist.\nMennel Milling staff connects the ton containers to the feed system. The maximum number of ton containers is 6 (12,000\npounds).\nMennel Milling Co. uses vacuum feed systems that are inherently safe. These systems involve the use of air or water flowing\nthrough an eductor that creates a vacuum. This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping\nsystem. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the\nvacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co.(REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and\ncorrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\nPOLICIES AND PROGRAMS\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive environmental, safety, and health management system that includes\nPSM/RMP.
