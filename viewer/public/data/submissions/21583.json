      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at ATOFINA's Calvert City production facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n-Introduction;\n-ATOFINA policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n-Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n-Hazard Assessment;\n-Prevention Program;\n-Five-Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\n-Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nATOFINA Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nATOFINA's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager, the HES Manager, and the Plant Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nThe ATOFINA Calvert City facility is located at 4444 Industrial Parkway, Calvert City, Kentucky.  The facility manufactures refrigerants by continuous chemical reaction and purification processes and premium plastic resins through a combination of continuous (monomer"

Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.  These substances include:\n\nHydrogen fluoride (HF) - 1,734,000 lbs;\nChlorine - 194,000 lbs; \nVinylidene fluoride - 649,000 lbs.\n\nHF and chlorine are used as process reactants.  Vinylidene fluoride is both a product for off-site sale and a reactant in a polymerization process.\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic chemicals is a catastrophic failure of one of the HF storage tanks in the AHF Storage and Handling facility.  HF is received as a liquid in pressurized rail cars and unloaded into 3 storage tanks, each of which has nominal capacity of 365,000 pounds; this quantity was assumed to be released over 10 minutes in the worst-case scenario.\n\nHazard assessment modeling shows that, under worst-case weather conditions, the worst-case release for toxic chemicals could produce an HF plume that could travel more than 25 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable chemicals is a catastrophic failure of the vinylidene fluoride storage tank (230,000 lb capacity) in the Monomer unit.  Hazard assessment modeling results in a distance to a 1 psi overpressure of 0.30 mile.  The worst case scenario does not result in a direct offsite impact.\n\nIt should be noted that the worst-case scenarios are extremely unlikely events due to the extensive safeguards in place.  This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA to reduce the risk of this type of event.\n\nWorst-Case Release Mitigation Measures\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive measures make it very unlikely that a significant release will occur.  In addition, in the unlikely event"

Passive mitigation systems include diking to limit the spread of HF and, consequently, the release impact.\n\nActive mitigation systems cannot be considered in modeling worst-case scenario impacts, but the significant investment that ATOFINA has made in active mitigation measures should effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP incident.  These include:\n\n-HF could be pumped from a damaged tank into another storage tank to reduce the amount potentially released.\n\n-Diking system is provided with an open drain to a trench with a pumping system that can be manually activated to contain and collect spilled HF.\n\n-HF tanks are under continuous observation to detect any problems, including operator visual inspections (4 to 6 times per day), video camera surveillance, and both local and control room indicators for pressure and tank level/alarm.\n\n-HF detectors are strategically located to provide early warning of any release.\n\n-Extensive firewater system in the event of a fire resulting from a vinylidene fluoride release\n\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nOne alternative scenario for each regulated toxic substance and for the one regulated flammable substance was also modeled in the hazard assessment.  The alternative release scenario for HF is failure of an unloading hose from a rail car, and the HF plume was estimated to go 2.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine is failure of a relief valve on a one-ton container, and the chlorine plume is estimated to go 0.6 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.  The alternative release scenario for vinylidene fluoride is the loss of the contents of one tube on a tube trailer; the endpoint used was the lower flammability limit, which resulted in "

Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n-In-depth process hazards analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n-Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n-Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n-A safety work permit system assures that process work is done safely and properly;\n\n-A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n-Critical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating condition;\n\n-Pre-startup reviews are done to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n-Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; and\n\n-Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in accident reduction.
