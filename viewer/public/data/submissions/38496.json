If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at AGP Corn Processing is the production of ethyl alcohol from corn. Natural gasoline is used to denature the ethyl alcohol product. The maximum quantity of natural gasoline stored is 310,448 pounds. Natural gasoline contains butane, pentane, and isopentane.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implementated the required provisions of the Program Level 2 RMP. This includes the development and implementation of safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. A hazard review has been conducted and training has been completed. Procedures for compliance audits and incident investigations have also been developed. The facility has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program and a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan that covers this process, as well as other applicable regulations.\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of natural gasoline in the past five years that;\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\n     - have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n     a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III ( EPCRA ).\n     c.  A Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Pla"
