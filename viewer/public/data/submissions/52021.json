The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal work force during the spring and summer months.  The plant produces fresh, fresh frozen and cooked frozen seafood products.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available.  It has excellent warning properties:  It is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  The maximum inventory of ammonia in the plant is 19,685 pounds.  In calculating worst case and alternate scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to over estimate rather than under estimate the effects of a release.  The plant has been operating safely since 1962.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nA worst-case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Failure of the largest vessel in the system, the High Pressure Receiver (HPR), when filled to capacity would release 11,781 pounds of ammonia.  The HPR is located in the machinery room.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the HPR fails catastrophically, releasing its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  To obtain the most conservative assumption, it is assumed that the building does not mitigate the rate of release, but the ammonia exits to the outdoors via doors and ventilation shafts in the machinery room roof.  The release is modeled using RMP Comp software.  Modeling results show the distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.2 miles (1.9 km) to be 140 mg/m3 (200ppm).  Census data indicates the residential population within the radius of release to be 2420.\n\nAlternative Release S"

In this scenario, a pipe to a plate freezer in the cold storage complex breaks resulting in a liquid ammonia release to atmoshphere.  The release occurs indoors.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in Chapter 4 of the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (EPA GAR) and calculated by RMP Comp software.  \n\nRelease Prevention Program:\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system itself has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves.  Plant personnel responsible for the system have had extensive training in ammonia systems and hazardous material handling and response.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nPer the requirement of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at the facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods mainta"

The facility has coordinated its emergency response plan with local authorities and responders and conducts drills periodically to practice responses."
