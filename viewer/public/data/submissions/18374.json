There is no production on-site at the installation.\n  7 Use of Regulated Substance:  Propane, CAS# 74-98-6, flammable, is the regulated substance.  Propane is processed in an propane-air station to create a mixture to fuel generators for heat and energy.  The system was installed in 1995 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  7 Quantities Handled or Stored:  There is a maximum of 14,400 gallons, 61,056.0 pounds, or 27,694.5 Kg (at 600 Fahrenheit) of propane that can be stored in the 18,000 gallon aboveground storage tank. \n\nc. Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nWorst-case scenario is a release scenario which creates an explosion, releasing 100 percent of the chemical in a vapor plume at ambient temperature and pressure.  The worst-case for a 100 percent release, with 10 percent of the total release exploding in the vapor plume, would travel 0.32 miles. The closest public receptor is located 0.58 miles from the propane tank.  Calculation for the worst case release scenario is located in the Offsite Consequence Analysis.  \n\nd.
