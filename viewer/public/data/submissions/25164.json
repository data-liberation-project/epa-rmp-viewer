      "SummaryText": "ciated with a large vapor release from process equipment.\n \n       NOTE:  The unit using Phosphorus Oxychloride has been shutdown.  These improvements will not be \n                   necessary.\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia:\n\n    *  Upgrade controls and procedures to prevent \"roll-over\" and potential damage of the storage tank due \n       to unloading a large quantity of warm ammonia.\n      \n    *  Upgrade interlock system and safety design of boom and hydraulic cylinders on barge unloading.\n\n    *  Implement program to periodically monitor equipment/foundation for differential settlement to prevent \n       excessive stress on equipment and potential damage.\n\n    *  Upgrade pressure relief system on storage tank annular space.\n\n    *  Improve integrity/reliability of flare that controls emission from storage tank.\n\n    *  Upgrade transfer systems, processes and facilities to reduce the release quantity due to \n       catastrophic failure and limit off-site exposure.\n\n    *  Upgrade the temperature control system to reduce the potential hazards of equipment overpressure\n       and also to prevent low temperature ammonia from entering the transfer pipeline.\n\n       NOTE:  These improvements have been completed."
