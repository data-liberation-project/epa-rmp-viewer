In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established Program 2 and Program 3 prevention requirements, GEC has implemented the Program 3 prevention requirements, which are as follows:\r\n\r\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation, and is the most rigorous prevention program. It has been established for the Anhydrous Ammonia System. The following sections briefly describe the elements of GEC's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe GEC Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Anhydrous Ammonia System, consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tProcess Safety Information: GEC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered process. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled in the process, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process (including standard operating procedures (SOPs)) and (3) design basis and configuration of process equipment.\r\n\r\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at GEC, including regulated substances in the covered process. Information on the technology and engineering design of the covered process includes the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMany of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\r\n\r\n2.\tProcess Hazard Analysis: The GEC performs and periodically re-validates process hazard anal"

Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n5.\tMechanical Integrity: GEC maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.\r\n\r\n6.\tManagement of Change: The GEC management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form. All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n7.\tPre-startup Review: GEC performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.

GEC will assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process. This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations will be resolved, and appropriate improvements to the prevention program will be implemented.\r\n\r\n9.\tIncident Investigation: GEC investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented. GEC trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\r\n\r\n10.\tEmployee Participation: The GEC developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that GEC workers participate in the development and continuous improvement of these prevention program elements. Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program through the training program.

Personnel performing hot work are required to have an approved permit prior to beginning their work. Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the GEC safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n12. \tContractors: GEC has established Contractor Safety and Health Guidelines to outline expectations related to contractor work at the GEC including work on the covered process. The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that GEC only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. GEC explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, GEC safe work practices, and GEC emergency response procedures. GEC requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process. GEC periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, GEC has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the GEC. The Anhydrous Ammonia System has been designed to handle Anhydrous Ammonia. GEC compared Anhydrous and Aqueous Ammonia and determined that Anhydrous Ammonia was more appropriate to minimize the potential for serious incident or off-site impact due to the following:\r\n\r\n* decrease in the number of deliveries to the site; therefore less trucks traffic;\r\n* decrease in the number of delivery truck hook-ups and disconnects which is when the majority of all Ammonia releases occur; and\r\n* decrease in the number of failure points (i.e., valves, pumps, flanges"

Executive Summary\r\n\r\nGarrison Energy Center (GEC) is committed to safely operating in a manner that is protective of GEC workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, GEC has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all its employees and operations. GEC believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee.\r\n\r\nAs part of this commitment, GEC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at GEC and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at GEC. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at GEC.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at GEC consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\r\n\r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\r\n\r\n3.\t \tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\r\n\r\nAl"

In fact, GEC has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing various levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries/damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nGEC limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at GEC, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  Part of GEC's RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, GEC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect GEC workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nGEC works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When a hazardous substance is used at GEC, the equipment is designed, built, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\r\n\r\nGEC limits damage from a release, if such a release were to occur. GEC trains workers to react quickly in the event of an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release were to occur. In addition, GEC works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\r\n\r\nThe safety program at GEC consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at GEC that are required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nGEC is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of t"

The RMP regulations require that such an analysis include an evaluation of both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. GEC does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. However in accordance with the RMP requirements, a worst case release analysis was conducted and the results are reported in this document.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated are intended to represent releases that might occur and were based on experience at GEC facilities. The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve community emergency response plans. An alternativ"

While GEC believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at the Garrison facility, GEC has evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nGEC has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document and RMP*Comp that was developed to provide the highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such a release. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The model was developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern. GEC has not conducted a more detailed analysis of these scenarios because the potential for such releases is unlikely and because more refined analysis of such events will not provide additional information that would be useful.\r\n\r\nWhile the model provides the required data to meet regulatory requirements, it does not provide detailed information on the travel time or concentration of the chemical in the plume. Typical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release is:\r\n\r\n* Physical State: gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\r\n* Release Type: continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\r\n* Release Condition: height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of curbing, exit velocity, release diameter, and exit temperature\r\n* Chemical Properties: molecular weight, specific gravity, vapor pressure, density, latent heat, and other properties depending upon the model\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical parameters that characterize a release, meteorological data is needed by the model t"

Meteorological data is used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance. The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration. Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\r\n* Temperature: Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\r\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\r\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence. The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects. Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce concentrations. For the RMP modeling performed the following meteorological parameters were used for the two scenarios:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\r\n* Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second\r\n* Stability: F\r\n* Temperature: 77 deg.

At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less. When considering the release of a toxic substance, such as anhydrous ammonia, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-ter"

The recommended response to a release is to shelter-in-place and to shut off any air intakes (e.g., air conditioners or fresh air make-up systems).\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GEC. These requirements are:\r\n\r\n* One worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (the GEC does not have any processes meeting the Program 1 definition)\r\n* One worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\r\n* One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e. one scenario representing the Anhydrous Ammonia process)\r\n\r\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by GEC. 1.3.1 Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the instantaneous release of the maximum onsite quantity of 10,200 gal (56,000 pound) of Anhydrous Ammonia from the storage tank. The solution evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The Anhydrous Ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The scenario results in off-site impacts to public receptors.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for the Anhydrous Ammonia System consists of failure of a 2 inch liquid fill line at the tank connection point resulting in a release rate of 412 pounds per minute assuming a density of 5.21 lbs/gal. The release would last for a duration of 10 minutes resulting in a total release of 4,120 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia. Operators would be notified of a release by Ammonia monitors located around the tank and throughout the process area. The containment area would limit the extent of spread of the liquid Ammonia. The scenario does not result in off-site impacts because there are no off-site receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevent"

The piping is double-contained, wrapped with corrosion protection tape, cathodically protected, and the interstitial space is monitored. The process uses an advanced control system with emergency shutdowns to ensure safe operation. Detectors and alarms located around the tank, injection skids, and Heat Recovery Steam Generator provide continuous monitoring for Ammonia in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\r\n\r\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nGEC is required to complete a review of the covered process for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation. Since the system is new, there have been no incidents involving the regulated processes that have resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\r\n\r\nGEC has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. GEC does not have First Responder capabilities. GEC's response will be to notify the LEPC and other off-site emergency response personnel in the event of serious incident or off-site impact. The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\n* Informing the LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\n* Clear identification of communication, roles and responsibilities during an emergency event.\r\n\r\n* Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.
