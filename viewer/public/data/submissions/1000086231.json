US Mag employs approximately 450 individuals in a wide variety of jobs. The facility for magnesium production at Rowley has operated for approximately 32 years. The magnesium operation derives its raw materials form the waters of the Great Salt Lake.   The manufacturing facility utilizes a wide variety of chemical, electrochemical and pyro-metallurgical unit processes to produce high-grade primary and alloyed magnesium. In addition to magnesium, US Mag also produces chlorine as a co-product and other byproducts from its operations.\n\n\n\nUS Mag is committed to the safety of its employees as well as the safety of the surrounding community. It has taken the necessary steps to prevent the accidental release of hazardous chemicals including those regulated by the regulation under which this document is submitted/resubmitted. To aid the prevention of accidental releases, US Mag has long had a published emergency response plan that addresses a wide range of contingencies involving on-site as well as off-site consequences should an accident occur. US Mag has analyzed its production processes by formal Process Hazard Analysis methods utilizing a diversity of employee disciplines and perspectives to assure that the potential hazards are recognized and properly addressed.  US Mag has a system that addresses and manages changes to its equipment and processes in a controlled way that recognizes and minimizes the inherent hazards. US Mag has an extensive employee training program that deals with all facets involved of its operations.      The range of that training involves job safety, product quality, environmental responsibility, production efficiency, etc. This training system develops the necessary working knowledge to assist the prevention of accidental releases.     \n\n\n\nIn regards to the RMP plan that is being su"

      "SummaryText": "bmitted/resubmitted, US Mag has two chemicals in volumes that exceed the threshold quantities specified by the regulation.  Chlorine, which is produced onsite, is at all times in excess of the 2,500 lb threshold value.  This chlorine is stored for use in the manufacture of magnesium and ferric chloride, and is also available for outside sales via rail cars or trucks.  Titanium tetrachloride is used as a manufacturing aid to produce certain specialty magnesium products.   It is received in commercial liquid cylinders of 3200 lbs, which exceeds the 2500 lbs threshold.\n\n\n\nAll of the equipment involved in producing magnesium and chlorine is protected by a detailed preventative and predictive maintenance program to assure proper equipment operation and availability. The vessels that store and transport chlorine are coded pressure vessels and are periodically checked in accordance with applicable codes and good engineering practice via hydrostatic testing, ultrasonic thickness gauging, and other non-destructive testing to assure safe and continued operation. The processes involving chlorine production and use are monitored and in many areas controls are automated to assist accident prevention. The equipment that controls chlorine in the manufacturing process have adequate redundancy and fail safes that aid in preventing catastrophic releases of chlorine in any, but most unlikely circumstances. Accidental release of stored chlorine is prevented by standard industrial systems including vents, pressure relief valves and rupture disks, check valves, excess flow valves, scrubbing equipment, manual and automatic shut off systems, and other conventional systems.\n\n\n\nTitanium tetrachloride is received in commercial DOT approved transport cylinders containing 3200 lbs when full.  It is conveyed into the process by a short run of tubing. The titanium tetrachloride process has been subjected to process hazard analysis via HAZOP. Employees are appropriately trained to deal with the po"

Our records don't show any incident where there were off-site deaths, injuries, significant property or environmental damage that has occurred as the result of accidental release of either chlorine or titanium tetrachloride. \n\n\n\nUS Mag is actively involved as a member of the local emergency planning committee and contributes expertise as well as some resources to that group. That plan has been reviewed in the past by the Utah Division of Emergency Response and Remediation and was given the grade of \"A\" for completeness and applicability. US Mag's emergency response plan and resources are included in the Tooele County Emergency Response Plan.   Due to its' remote location, it is unrealistic to expect immediate response from public agencies in the event of an emergency. Consequently US Mag maintains a fire brigade composed of state certified fireman, an Emergency Medical Technician group, and a hazardous material response team. All of these groups have onsite presence at Rowley 24 hours of every day.\n\n\n\nUS Mag is committed to continuous improvement. The current systems in place to prevent accidental releases have been and will be periodically reviewed. Modifications that will improve safety and avoid accidental release of regulated substances have been and will be implemented through managed improvement."
