      "SummaryText": "The Phenix City Water Filtration Plant is a 10.8 MGD surface water treatment facility.  The average daily output is approximately 7 MGD.  The plant is located at 1100 32nd Street in Phenix City, Alabama.  This plant is designed to produce a safe supply of drinking water from the Chattahoochee River.  The plant utilizes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration processes.  The final stage is disinfection.  In the disinfection process a hazardous chemical, chlorine, is injected to kill pathogenic organisms.  Because of large amounts required, enough must be stored on site to support the demand of the system.  The amount ranges from 4,000 to 10,000 pounds.  The area in which it is stored is ventilated, and is equiped with a leak detection device.  A minimal leak will be detected and the unit will then activate the alarm system which includes an alarm bell and a remote alarm located in the operationsbuilding to warn personnel of a possible emergency situation.  This facility is equiped with self contained breathing apparatus and a Chlorine Institute Repair Kit for ton cylinders.  Plant personnel are trained professionals and are frequently instructed in safe operational and emergency procedures.  No accidentshave occured as a result of use or accidental release of chlorine in the past five years.  In a worst case scenario the release of this chemical could result in possible evacuation within a three mile radius.  The local fire department is aware of the location and effects of this chemical.  In the event of a major leak the fire department would be notified and is trained to handle the situation.  The Russell County Emergency Management agency would also be notified and assist with any emergency evacuation or other procedures as needed.  Personnel at the Water Plant are continuously trained and breifed of any changes in procedures.  The storage areas are well maintained.  To ensure safety, the chlorine system is routinely assessed for repair and upgrade"
