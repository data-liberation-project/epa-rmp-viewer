      "SummaryText": "Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) operates a conventional surface water treatment plant, utilizing softening, clarification, filtration and disinfection to produce an average of just under 50 million gallons per day for its 415,000 customers.  As a disinfectant, SPRWS uses chlorine and ammonia.  Both chemicals exceed the threshold quantities established by the EPA in the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r).  Therefore, SPRWS first completed a risk management plan (RMP) in June of 1999, and continues to update the plan with this document.\r\n\r\nSPRWS has invested significant amounts of money to have a state-of-the-art facility for handling chlorine and ammonia.  SPRWS has also invested significant amounts of time in training operators in safe handling of the chemicals and also in running drills with the Saint Paul Fire Department, Maplewood Fire Department, and Maplewood Police. These drills simulate our response in the event of an uncontrollable leak on one of these systems. (Note that an uncontrolled leak would occur only when our emergency shutdown mechanisms failed to control 100% of any leak, which would be extremely rare.) Our HazMat teams are well prepared to deal with a leak at our facility. We have developed a continuity of operations plan, and have done a considerable amount of emergency planning.\r\n\r\nThough our chlorine/ ammonia facility went on-line in 1999 and was state-of-the-art at the time, SPRWS has invested more money to make it even safer since then. Automatic railcar valve closers were added in 2007 to further limit any potential releases. Previously, a section of piping was not protected by this automatic valve closing system, and this represented a risk to SPRWS. The additional automatic valves were added, and now the entire piping system beyond the railcar is protected. Access control has also been added since the original construction. Cameras, motion detectors, perimeter sensors, climb resistant fencing, and card access limited to personnel"

      "SummaryText": "with a need to enter serve to ensure that only qualified people are entering the facility. The facility, equipped with two sets of automatic valve closers, sensors, scrubbers, and access control, is updated to keep it at state-of-the-art status.\r\n\r\nAny changes in our system are handled through the \"management of change\" section of our process safety management (PSM) program, and as such are given a thorough review before going on-line. Regular audits of both the RMP and PSM programs are done to ensure that we maintain our high standards, and are in compliance with EPA regulations. Monthly tests for both emergency shut-down systems, involving a complete and live shutdown, are performed to ensure mechanical integrity of emergency functions. We have also completed vulnerability assessments and made both physical changes and policy changes as a result of the assessments. We have completed a new railcar handling policy and a railcar security plan.\r\n\r\nSPRWS had two very minor leaks on our chlorine system; one August 20, 2009, and one on April 8, 2011. We were able to contain the leak and repair the problem in both instances. There were no consequences for either the environment or our neighbors adjacent to our treatment plant. The leak in 2009 released less than one pound of chlorine; the leak in 2011 released less than one ounce of chlorine. Both leaks were in our chlorine/ ammonia building, and were confined to that building. Because they were indoors, weather was not a factor. The building is equipped with a scrubber system. The leak in 2009 caused the scrubber to turn on briefly; the leak in 2011 was so small that sensors did not pick it up and the scrubbers never came on."
