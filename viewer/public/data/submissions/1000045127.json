Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Pasco to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPasco Corporation of America is a bakery manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes baked foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 16,000 pounds of"

There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView V (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPasco complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\n\n\nPasco written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Pasco Maintenance Manager. \n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the re"

Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPasco has a written Emergency Response Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Response regulations, OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Portland Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Pasco and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\n\n \n\nIncident Command Center\n\nEmergency Alarm and Communication System\n\nEmergency Response Team\n\nEvacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Portland Fire Department, including the Portland HazMat Response Team stationed at the Portland Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nAll Pasco personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.   \n\n"

Any upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nPasco will continue to conduct emergency response training for affected personnel to ensure that all employees are able to perform their expected duties during an emergency.  Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\nPasco completed a PSM/RMP compliance audit in May of 2012.  Audit recommendations have been addressed at this time. Pasco expects to update and re-validate the Process Hazard Analysis before April 2015.  Recommendations from the PHA will guide the specific actions to improve safety at the facility."
