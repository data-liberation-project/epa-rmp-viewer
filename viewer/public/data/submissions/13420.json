The Facility Policy\n             The management and employees of Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental chemical releases.  The facility has a safety program in place and prevention check-lists to deter any possible equipment failures.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work closely with the local authorities and the local fire department to mitigate any release and to reduce the impact to the local people and environment.\n\n2.)   The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n             Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. is primarily a retail business for the sale of chemicals, fertilizers, and seeds to the farmer.  The plant also buys grain from the farmer and stores and/or sells grain to other terminals.\n             Anhydrous Ammonia is the regulated substance handled at Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc.  It is received by truck, stored, and sold to farmers for crop production nutrients.\n             The maximum quantity stored of anhydrous ammonia at Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. would be 190,000 pounds.  This would be stored in the two inter-connected 12,000 gallon storage tanks, six 500 gallon applicators, and twenty 1,000 gallon nurse tanks at an administrative filling limit of 85% of design capacity.  This maximum amount would only apply during the spring season.  The rest of the year, the maximum amount would be approximately 90,000 pounds in relationship to the six 500 gallon applicators and  twenty 1,000 gallon nurse tanks at an administrative filling limit of 85% of design capacity.\n\n3.)   The Worst-Case Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n             a.)  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, I"

The maximum quantity released would be 110,000 pounds which represents the amount WITHOUT regard to the administrative filling limit of 85% of design capacity.  With the assumptions of the scenario at 1.5 meters/second wind speed;  77 degrees F air temperature;  and stability class of F, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.7 miles.  This distance would affect approximately 540 people in residences which would include a small recreational lake area.\n             b.)  The alternative scenario based on the most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a transfer hose on a 1,000 gallon nurse tank.  The assumptions of the scenario are 3 meters/second wind speed; 77 degrees F air temperature; stability class of D; and a puncture of .79 square inches of a 1 inch hose.  The excess flow valve would be used as active mitigation to reduce the release by 50%.  The estimated total quantity released would be 2,000 pounds with an estimated distance to toxic end point at .1 mile.  The distance would affect approximately 60 people in residences.\n\n4.)   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n             Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. follows, to the best of their knowledge, the safety and storage requirements set forth by \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anydrous Ammonia, \nK-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupatiional Safety and Health Administration, (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  \n             The management is promoting employees to attend yearly workshops on anhydrous ammonia safety made available by the Michigan Agri-Business Association.  Also, the management has implemented a safety maintenance program that annually reviews all major and minor aspects of the storage faci"

The Five-Year Accident History\n               Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. has had no accident history within the past five years.\n\n6.)     The Emergency Response Program\n               Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. has an emergency response plan in place.  They have recently updated the HAZ/MAT emergency operations plan in coordination with the local emergency services and the local fire department.  They also provide the state and local authorities with the community\nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  All employees are trained in the proper response plan in the event of an emergency and how to work effectively with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n\n7.)      Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n               Safety improvement is a continual process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  After recent review, there are no new mitigation plans at the present time.  \n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n1.  RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance\n2.  RMP Comp\n3.  EPA CEPPO Homepage\n4.
