RMP Covered Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nLRWU owns and operates its water treatment plant in Lowell, Massachusetts.  The plant treats potable water from the intake station, which pumps the water directly from the Merrimack River, and distributes it to municipalities in the Lowell area.  The only chemical present at the plant in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the chemical accident prevention rule is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect water as it is pumped from the intake station.\n\nChlorine is stored in 2,000 lb. tanks within the chlorinator room.  The chlorinator room is equipped with chlorine detectors which sound an alarm in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nThe total maximum amount of chlorine stored on-site is 16,000 lbs. (8 tanks).  The maximum amount of chlorine used at any one time in the chlorination process is 8,000 lbs.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, LRWU\u0012s off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals (chlorine) and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released instantaneously on a warm night with slow, steady wind.  According to the Chlorine Institute, no 2,000 lb. chlorine tank has ever released its contents in ten minutes.  The pro"

The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and LRWU\u0012s RMP accident prevention program.  It provided a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards posed by the chlorination process.  The PHA utilized the what-if/PHA methodology in accordance with 29 C.F.R. ' 1910.119(e) and 40 C.F.R. ' 68.67.  \n\nThe PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases (e.g., process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms); (3) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls; (4) facility siting; (5) human factors (human error); and (6) a qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on the employees in the work place.\n\n4.0 Operating Procedures.

      "SummaryText": "bability of such an event is extremely low.\n\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the plant (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of a 2,000 lb. chlorine tank, filled to maximum capacity.  If such a \nrelease occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside of the plant\u0012s property line.\n\nLRWU developed an alternative release of chlorine that focuses on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modeling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the Process Hazard Analysis performed on the chlorination process and all past releases, LRWU has chosen an alternative release scenario that involves a valve failure in the chlorinator room. This scenario is based on an actual release which occurred in 1996 at the LRWU\u0012s water intake station.\n\nApproximately 53 pounds of chlorine were released during to the environment during this incident.  The incident lasted approximately fifteen minutes.  The chlorine leaked as a liquid or gas, and liquid vaporized into gas almost immediately.  The chlorine gas was vented from the chlorinator room to the outside by exhaust fans.  No such valve failure has ever occurred at the treatment plant, but, because this release had occurred at a similar facility with a similar process, it was selected as the type of release most likely to occur.\n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nLRWU has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management rule found. at 29 C.F.R.

LRWU Risk Management Program complements this overall accident prevention and response program.  LRWU\u0012s Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA\u0012s) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  This document is the RMP plan for the water treatment plant.  LRWU has prepared a separate RMP Plan for the treatment plant\u0012s intake station, which is located approximately = mile west of the plant.  This RMP Plan provides the public with information about the treatment plant\u0012s processes, accident prevention programs, and emergency response planning efforts.   LRWU\u0012s compliance with EPA\u0012s RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history.  LRWU has never experienced an RMP reporta"

LRWU has developed an integrated contingency plan that satisfies all applicable state and federal emergency response and prevention planning requirements (described under emergency response policies below). \n\n13.0 Compliance Audits.  LRWU will perform a compliance audit to evaluate the water treatment plant\u0012s compliance with the PSM Standard and the RMP rule at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices it has developed are adequate and being followed.  A report of the RMP and PSM audit findings will be developed. \n\n14.0 Trade Secrets.  LRWU makes all necessary information available to those persons responsible for compiling process safety information and those assisting in the development of the process hazard analysis. \n\nE. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe water treatment plant has never experienced a release that requires reporting under the chemical accident prevention rule.\n\nF. Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nLRWU\u0012s trained emergency response team provides initial response to all leaks and spills, with assistance provided on an as-needed basis by the Lowell Fire Department and other emergency responders.  LRWU\u0012s emergency response team members have all been trained to OSHA\u0012s Incident Commander level.  Emergency response procedures are described in detail in LWRU\u0012s integrated contingency plan.  Employees have been trained on confined space entry procedures and the proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE).  In the event of small fires, all plant employees are trained in the use of fire extinguishers.  Personnel have also been trained to notify the plant manager in the event of more extensive accidental releases.  The Operat"

      "SummaryText": "ions Superintendent is responsible for assessment of releases, internal notification of releases, and determination of whether outside responders are needed.  During an emergency, all non-emergency response team LRWU employees have been trained to evacuate to a predesignated muster point to assist outside response teams.\n\nIn the event that an accidental release occurs that is beyond the capabilities of LRWU\u0012s emergency response team to control, the plant depends on the the Lowell Fire and Police Departments for outside support.  The Lowell Fire Department operates under mutual aid agreements with surrounding and nearby towns to ensure that additional  emergency response personnel and equipment are available to respond to an emergency release at the plant.  In addition, LRWU has an agreement with an outside contractor, Jones Chemical, to provide emergency response services, if needed.\n\nLRWU has also adopted and implements an Integrated Contingency Plan that meets the regulatory requirements of the following federal and state response planning and prevention laws:  \n\n7 OSHA Emergency Response Plan (29 C.F.R. 1910.120(q))\n7 OSHA Process Safety Management emergency response requirements (29 C.F.R.
