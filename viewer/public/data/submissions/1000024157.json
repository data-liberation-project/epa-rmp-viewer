To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented. Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate the facility.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from various field wells. Separated natural gas undergoes a chilling process to strip out NGL liquids which are stored in a single 42,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank. Administrative controls are implemented at the facility which limits the total volumes to 33,000 gallons in the pressurized bullet tank. Separated crude oil/condensate is stored in two (2) 400 barrel bulk tanks. Stored oil is located within containment dikes which serve as an administrative control measure.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane. For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThe facility has not experienced an incident as defined by the regulations within the past 5 years.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required. This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility. The prevention program does discuss both NGL and condensate which are the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity. As documented in Section 4.0 of the RMP, the facility "
