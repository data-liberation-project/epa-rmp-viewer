CWSID may have up to 70,000 lbs of CL2 on-site.\n\nIt is CWSID's goal to provide a safe and effective way for treating wastewater generated by residents and businesses.  Present treatment operations at CWSID require the use of chlorine.  With respect for the potential hazards involved with using CL2, CWSID has taken many steps to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAccident History\nCWSID has been using chlorine to disinfect waste water since it began operations in 1959. Since that time, there has not been a release of a reportable quantity of chlorine.\n\nAccident Prevention\nSystem Design - The CL2 storage tanks and the delivery trailers that CL2 is offloaded from have excess flow valves that automatically close if the liquid CL2 flow exceeds 7,000 lbs per hour.  The CL2 systems are housed in a concrete building.  The chlorine building is equipped with climate controls systems that maintain a year round temperature near 70 degrees F. All chlorination equipment and systems within the chlorine building can be operated on back-up power from generators in the event of a power failure.\n\nWith the exception of being in the liquid phase in the storage tanks, the CL2 system is a gas phase system.  The CL2 system has been engineered to tolerate phase transitions or reliquification. The majority of the CL2 delivery systems are kept under constant vacuum pressure and have self-actuating valvles that shut off the flow in the event of a failure. The CL2 building is vented to a scrubber system that is designed to neutralize 70,000 lbs of CL2.\n\nSystem Operation\nThe CL2 system is highly automated and automatically dispenese and manges the flow of CL2.  Only experienced operatos who have had extensive training are permitted to operate the CL2 systems.\n\nSystem Inspection & Maintenan"

      "SummaryText": "ce\nThe CL2 system components undergo mechanical integrity inspections on equipment and perfomrance testing on safety controls. Inspections from outside contractors and safety advisors are conducted to ensure that operator training and district operating procedures are effeciently established.  Routine upgrades, change-outs and rebuilding are conducted as recommended by equipment manufacturers.\n\nEmergency Response\nIn the event of an emergency release, CWSID has a leak team made up of experienced operators who have been trained and are equipped to control and stop leaks. The CL2 leak team coordinates emergency response drills and activities with the local fire department."
