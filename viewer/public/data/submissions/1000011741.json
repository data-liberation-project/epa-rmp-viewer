      "SummaryText": "Wilkins-Rogers, Inc. is a flour milling company located at 27 Frederick Road, Ellicott City, Baltimore County Maryland. The substance in use is chlorine which is used to bleach flour in order to lower the ph and improve the baking quality, as well as to chlorinate the wheat temper water to reduce the micro load of the wheat.The chlorine tanks are located on the second floor of the facility in a separate, locked room. The piping runs up to the 5th and the 8th floors of the flour mill and are clearly marked and identifiable. The monitoring system and the valves used to control the amount added to the flour at any given time are located on the 5th floor of the flour mill. The alarm for the system is located in the millers office on the 4th floor of the flour mill. We are supplied with chlorine through Caravan Ingredients. Caravan Ingredients comes in on an annual basis to train and review procedures with those employees responsible for operating the chlorine equipment,as well as other employees that work with or come in contact with the chlorine cylinders. In addition, Caravan Ingredients comes in on a quarterly basis to check out all the chlorine equipment including but not limited to tanks, lines, valves, connectors, diaphrams, rotometers, and annually our local fire department conducts an inspection of the facility in order to familiarize fire department personnel with the facility and to train new employees. They also make recommendations on any issues found. If a release were to occur, it is possible that the chlorine could impact areas beyond the facility grounds. the structure of the chlorine room is such that a release would be slowed in its movement out of the facility in either a worst case or alternative scenario. If a release occurred, our emergency response plan calls for the immediate notification of the local authorities by calling 911."
