      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWorld Class Distribution is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators / refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations.  World Class Distribution has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nWorld Class Distribution is located at 4239 Pock Lane in Stockton, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage and distribution of grocery products.  The system uses a maximum of 18,790 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) to the High Temp Recirculator (HTR-1). The High Pressure Receiver also sends liquid ammonia to the Compressors for liquid injection oil cooling.  \n\n\n\nAt the High Temp Recirculator, high temp recirculated liquid (+20F) is pumped to the dock and cooler evaporators and to the Medium Temp Recirculator (MTR-1). Medium temp recirculated liquid (-10F) is then pumped to the freezer evaporators and to the Low Temp Recirculator (LTR-1). Low temp recirculated liquid (-30F) is pumped to the Ice Cream Freezer Evaporators. Evaporators AU21-22, AU27-28, AU31-34 are conv"

The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) is returned to the vessel that fed the evaporator. All the evaporators receive hot gas for defrost. The defrost returns to the feed vessel, except at the Ice Cream Freezer Evaporators which send defrost return to the Medium Temp Recirculator. \n\n\n\nThese vessels are designed to prevent liquid ammonia from reaching the compressors based upon the temperature and application.  Excess liquid in the Low Temp Recirculator drains to the associated Liquid Transfer Vessel.  Hot gas from the Compressors is used to \"push\" the liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver.\n\n\n\nSuction is pulled from the vessels by the Compressors. Compressor C1 pulls low temp suction from the Low Temp Recirculator. Compressors C2-C3 pull medium temp suction from the Medium Temp Recirculator. Compressors C1-C3 also receive high temp suction (economizer suction) from the High Temp Recirculator for increased efficiency. Compressors C4 and C6 pull high temp suction from the High Temp Recirculator. Compressor C5 is a swing compressor and can pull suction from any one of the 3 vessels. It also receives high temp suction (economizer suction) from the High Temp Recirculator. The Compressors increase the pressure of the ammonia vapor through the discharge port of the machine. The Compressors send high-pressure discharge vapor to the Underfloor Heat Exchanger and Evaporative Condensers.  The high-pressure discharge is also routed to the Liquid Transfer Vessel (to pressurize the vessel and facilitate liquid transfer) and to the evaporators for hot gas defrost.  The Compressors receive liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver for liquid injection oil cooling.\n\n\n\nHot gas in the Underfloor Heat Exchanger is used to warm glycol used in a secondary loop for underfloor heatin"

The resulting suction is sent to the High Temp Recirculator.\n\n\n\nAt the Condensers, air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the compressor discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains back to the High Pressure Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again.\n\n\n\nAn auto purger is provided to remove non-condensables from the high side of the system. All relief valves are tied to a common header and relieve to the Ammonia Diffusion Tank.\n\n\n\nWorld Class Distribution operates the refrigeration system at the facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Operations and preventative maintenance are conducted by the refrigeration contractor.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nWorld Class Distribution has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the OES CalARP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n? Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n\n? Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n\n? Training for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n? Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; and\n\n? Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations. \n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization. An ammonia diffusion tank has also been installed to prevent a relief valve release from going offsite. Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAs t"

In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWorld Class Distribution has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor (C&L Refrigeration, (800) 901-4822) and the fire department (Stockton Fire Department, (209) 937-8801) for assistance as necessary.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis and a Seismic Assessment have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  World Class Distribution has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facilit"
