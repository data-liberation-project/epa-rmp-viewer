      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThis facility is owned and operated by Vertex Chemical Corporation (based in Roseville, Minnesota) and is a subsidiary of Hawkins, Inc.  Vertex was purchased by Hawkins in 2011.  Hawkins corporate office now oversees all aspects of this program and the Vertex facility works closely with the corporate office to stay in compliance, so both Hawkins and Vertex names will be used in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nHawkins and Vertex are very similar in nature, both in how they started out, and chemicals handled.  Both started out as small family owned businesses (Hawkins started in 1938 and Vertex in 1949).  Both have a long history of manufacturing sodium hypochlorite and using chlorine - the only chemical regulated by both PSM and RMP at this facility.  Both are active members in the Chlorine Institute and adhere to their guidelines.  The merging of these two companies has made both companies stronger as best practices are reviewed and the utilization of combined resources occur (employee knowledge, equipment, outside resources, etc.).  Hawkins is a publicly traded company.\n\n\n\nThis facility batch manufactures sodium hypochlorite using chlorine, sodium hydroxide and water, providing water and waste-water treatment, pulp and paper, and pool chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.\n\n\n\nVertex Chemical Corporation has been using this process to manufacture bleach since 1968 and started manufacturing in Dupo in 1969.  In 1998 a new Dupo manufacturing building was created with additional safety features.  \n\n\n\nThe Dupo facility is sited remote from immediate population groups, in an industrial/rail yard area with space, fences, security, natural obstacles separating the areas from casual public.  Secondary security fencing is located around the chlorine rail car unloading area to keep unauthorized personnel away from the chlorine unloading area.  Batch process is set up as close as possible to the chlorine railcars to red"

Be Safe!\" regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\n\n1.    A corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\n\n2.    Training programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\n\n3.    Prompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n4.    Adherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\n\n5.    Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\n\n6.    Internal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n7.    Members in good standing with the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a chemical distribution and manufacturing facility that handles several products used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  For example, this facility supplies bleach used in disinfection at food processors and health facilities.  This site manufactures sodium hypochlorite which uses chlorine in the process.  Chlorine is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  The only chemical covered by Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan for this facility is chlorine.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chemicals during shipping, storage, and use.  This starts with DOT FRA approved 90-ton rail cars that are robustly designed to"

It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely transfer chemicals during manufacture.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.\n\n\n\nHawkins accident prevention program includes:\n\n1. Procedures and training for handling chemicals during shipping and storage;\n\n2. Ensure vendor provides DOT approved cylinders;\n\n3. Provide employees with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation;\n\n4. Adhere to OSHA workplace regulations;\n\n5. Follow Chlorine Institute standards.\n\n\n\n5-year Accident History:  There has not been an accident involving chlorine at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a maintenance issue with chlorine equipment/rail car, employees are trained on how to detect the source of the issue and take appropriate action such as closing or tightening a valve.  If a larger accident should occur, this facility has a trained hazmat team and proper equipment (SCBA and C-kits) on-site to respond.  This facility also has a good working relationship with the local emergency planning committee and hazardous material responders (St. Clair Special Emergency Association) as well as the local volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\"\n\n"
