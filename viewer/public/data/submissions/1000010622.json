The quantity of ammonia used requires an OSHA\nProcess Safety Management and the EPA Level 3 Risk Management Program\nto assure the health and safety of on-site employees, off-site public and \nenvironmental receptors.\n\nThe facilityA?s refrigeration system uses standard materials, component, and \nindustry guidelines which provide overlapping layers of refrigeration system\nprotection through automatic and manual reduction and mitigation of operating\ndeviations. System changes have been changed in kind and have only been\nrequired to make a Management of Change on a new ice machine on 8/11/2009. \nStandard operating procedures were written for ice machine. We review all SOPA?s annually and make changes if needed.\n\nNo on-site or off-site ammonia related incident resulted in an injury, death, property\nor environmental damage during the 5-year accident history period prepared for\nthe Risk Management Plan.\n\nA ten minute unmitigated worst case release of 10,000 pounds of ammonia and\na ten minute unmitigated alternative release of 780 pound of ammonia were \nscenarios selected from EPA models and data to illustrate ammonia plume dispersion.\n\nWe will continue to do are best with the RMP and PSMP to have a safe plant.\n Jeff Johnson 8/27/2009\n                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n                        EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY\n\n\n\n"
