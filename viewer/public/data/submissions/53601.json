The contractor sustained chemical burns to his thighs and was sent to the hospital for treatment.   Approximately 20 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released during the incident.  Solar Transport Co. was deemed the responsible party.  Two separate incidents, involving product release, occurring July 24, 2005 and November 9, 2005 were reported to regulatory agencies.  The releases were not identified as causing deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility\u00bfs policy to notify the Marshall County Emergency Management Agency and request that they respond to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None identified at this time."
