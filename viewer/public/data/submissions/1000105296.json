      "SummaryText": "Elite Comfort Solutions is committed to operating and maintaining its facilities and\nprocesses safely and responsibly, providing safe conditions for Company employees,\nthe surrounding community, and the environment.\nThe Havre De Grace facility manufactures flexible polyurethane (PU) foam products\nfor the furniture and bedding industries. One of the significant chemical ingredients\nused in the PU foam manufacturing process is toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers)\n(TDI), CAS # 26471- 62-5. The TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 pounds. In\naccordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the\nworst-case scenario was defined as the rupture and immediate spillage of 190,000 lbs\nof TDI (the contents of a TDI railcar) on the ground without any secondary\ncontainment. The puddle area was calculated to be 76,072 square feet based on a\npuddle thickness of 1 centimeter. The impact of this spill was evaluated using the\nALOHA model and resulted in no public receptors within the endpoint radius of 198\nyards from the railcar."
