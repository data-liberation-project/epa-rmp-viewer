COGDILL,  DUNLAP, IOWA\nContact:\tSAM COGDILL\nPhone:\t\t712-643-2234\n\n     1.\tFacility Policy.\n\n     The owner SAM COGDILL is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of \n\tanhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment. \n\t\n2.\tFacility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of  Anhydrous ammonia for direct application for crop production nutrients, and not for resale.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 12000 gal. storage tank.  The maxium quantity stored would be 51000 lbs.\n     \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 51000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.5 miles.  \n\n          b.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.  \n     \n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part"
