      "SummaryText": "Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC operates an ethanol fuel production plant located in the city of Boyceville, in Dunn County, Wisconsin.  Big River Resource Boyceville, LLC assumed ownership of the facility in December 2011.  This RMP modification being completed to revise facility ownership and contact information.  In addition the denaturant storage calculations were updated to reflect this material's classification as a flammable mixture.  Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC will complete an RMP 5-year update in 2014, based upon the current RMP compliance date.\n\n\n\nAs a requirement of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Title 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site above RMP reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC include pentane (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold) and anhydrous ammonia (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBig River Resources Boyceville, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol production process, specifically anhydrous ammonia and denaturant, an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. Big River Resource Boyceville, LLC typically uses unleaded gasoline as a denaturant, which is not RMP-regulated; however, the facility, at times, uses natural gasoline, which is an RMP-regulated flammable containing the following RMP-regulated substances: butane, ethane, pentane and propane.  It is the policy of Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accident"

      "SummaryText": "al release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC to notify the Boyceville Fire Department and the Dunn County Emergency Management and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Anyhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 86,400 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant.  Big River Resource Boyceville, LLC typically uses unleaded gasoline as a denaturant, which is not RMP-regulated; however, the facility, at times, uses natural gasoline, which is an RMP-regulated flammable containing the following RMP-regulated substances: butane, ethane, pentane and propane.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is 100,000 gallons (approximately 667,200 pounds of natural gasoline).  The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is mixed with the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production; this tank is located in the facility tank farm area, which includes a secondary containment dike.  Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as they relate to the regulated substances.  An Emergency Response Program is currently being implemented. Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119.

Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews are conducted on a regular basis as outlined in the PSM/RMP Prevention Program.  Audits of the overall RMP and Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBig River Resources Boyceville, LLC does not have a history of accidents related to RMP-regulated programs which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nBig River Resources Boyceville, LLC is has developed their own written emergency response plan.  This plan includes actions to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances, actions to inform the public and local agencies responding to accidental releases and emergency health care information.  Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC routinely conducts employee training on the emergency response plan and periodically evaluates the plan for necessary revisions.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBig River Resources Boyceville, LLC completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the aqueous ammonia and flammables processes on August 3, 2011. A number of recommendations to improve facility safety were accepted as part of the PHA process, and a timeline was developed to track the recommendations to completion.  A complete summary of the PHA process and recommendation tracking progress is maintained at the facility.  \n\n\n\n"
