      "SummaryText": "\u00b7Introduction:\n\nThetford Corporation operates a holding tank deodorant blending and bottling operation in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The facility is located at 7101 Jackson Road in Scio Township.  The facility consists of one building that houses the blending and bottling operation, as well as product development and offices.  Overall, the facility employs 90 full time employees.\n\nIn December 2000, Thetford Corporation completed construction and began operation of a new state-of-the-art bottling facility.  The facility was designed according to accepted industry codes and the operating system is designed and operated with redundant safety systems and instrumentation.  The changes to the process have reduced chemical inventories, enclosed chemical transfers and cleanouts, improved containment of potential spills and therefore reduced the impact to the environment and our employees should an uncontrolled release of formaldehyde occur.\n\nThetford Corp is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Thetford has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the process at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at the Thetford facility.  This document is intended to satisfy that requirement and to provide the public with a description of the RMP at the plant.\n\n\u00b7Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThetford implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of formaldehyde.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installa"

The purpose of these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the event a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology is used in the design and construction of the process.  All modifications are inspected and reviewed before start-up.  Tanks used to store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary containment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases.  The tanker unload area is designed to contain all spills from a truck and prevent formaldehyde from reaching soil, ground or surface water.  All tanks storing formaldehyde are equipped with high level switches that alert operators that the tanks are full and shutdown transfers or agitation of the tank to prevent overfilling. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Thetford contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  Thetford provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nTo effectively implement these policies, Thetford established a management system headed by the Vice President/General Manager of Thetford to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\u00b7Regulated substance:\n\nFormaldehyde is the regulated substance handled in sufficient quantity to be covered by EPA's RMP rule.  It is the major active ingredient in the holding tank deodorants produced in the blending and bottling process.  The products are used in the holding tanks of recreational vehicles, boats and portable toilets.  Formaldehyde is received as a 37% solution in wate"

Within the entire process the maximum amount of actual formaldehyde is 86,105 pounds.  \n\n\u00b7Off-site consequence analysis:\n\nThetford performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of formaldehyde to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  Thetford does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur due to the controls in place.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance to the endpoint (under worst case conditions, the distance formaldehyde could travel before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public). When considering the release of formaldehyde, people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any health consequences.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, some short-term health effects are possible including irritation of the eyes, nose and throat.\n\nThe following summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Thetford.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a solution 37% formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank, 7,000 gallon (23,387 pounds of actual formaldehyde), within the building.  A new concrete secondary containment area in the bulk storage room contains the formaldehyde in the bulk storage room and limits the surface area of the formaldehyde available for evaporation.  No action by Thetford employees is taken to stop the release.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on the EPA look up tables is 0.06 miles or 317 feet.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for a"

The alternative release occurs for 10 minutes with action taken by Thetford employees to shut down the failing pump and isolate the storage tank to prevent additional leakage.  Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.06 miles or 317 feet.  \n \n\u00b7Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nIn 1995, Thetford developed and implemented a prevention program for the formaldehyde process to comply with the 13 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  Thetford is in full compliance with the OSHA standard.  The EPA RMP rule expands the OSHA PSM to include a focus on protecting the public and the environment.  According to an outside consultant who recently performed a compliance audit, The Thetford Corporation has conscientiously developed and implemented the PSM program at its facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The effort expended by all levels of management and labor at the facility to comply with the PSM standard and implement the PSM program is excellent.  The following highlights a few specific steps that are key to the prevention program.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)  - Thetford performs process hazard analyses on all mixing processes (formaldehyde and non-formaldehyde) in the building to identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A PHA committee reviews all recommendations from the PHA.  A schedule of action items and completion due dates are developed by the committee and assigned to individuals with responsibility in the respective area.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - Thetford's Management of Change (MOC) program ensures that changes made to the system do not alter the safe operation of the system.

The only changes that do not have to follow the management of change procedure are replacement in kind. \n\nMechanical Integrity - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Program is to make certain that the equipment in the process is installed, maintained, operated, inspected and tested to ensure its continued safe operation.  The program is designed to address the specific needs of each type of equipment covered. The Mechanical Integrity Program covers all equipment contained in the chemical mixing and the bottle filling rooms in the facility, including those that handle highly hazardous chemicals and those that do not.\n\nIncident Investigation - Thetford investigates all incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a release of formaldehyde so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\nFormaldehyde Specific Prevention Steps\n\nFormaldehyde solution is delivered to the facility by offsite vendors.  The formaldehyde solution is pumped directly to storage tanks inside the building.  The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde solution to storage tanks.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training annually emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by Thetford.   The new unload area can contain the entire contents of a ruptured tanker.  All spilled materials can be transferred to an indoor recovery tank from a remote control panel.

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the following:  \n\n1.  Informing the local fire department about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences \n2.  Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to formaldehyde at the facility\n3.  Containing accidental releases of formaldehyde including the use of emergency response equipment\n4.  Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n5.
