(Sterling Fibers) Santa Rosa County Florida facility (Santa Rosa Plant) are ingrained in the fundamentals of the process safety management process.\n\nAt our Santa Rosa Plant we presently handle two chemicals which are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as commodities in the production of consumer products also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the handling and production processes to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to employees as well as the surrounding community.\n\nIt is Sterling Fibers' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, and regulations.   Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle and process chemicals, the safety devices inherent to our process designs, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our workers.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at Sterling Fibers.   Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe operating practices is clearly evident in the oganization structure and employee empowerment.  This is no more evident than in our involvement in the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Our commitment to PSM standards is a strong example of management's commitment to continuously make the Santa Rosa plant a safe worksite.\n\nWe have made extensive improvements to safety and health programs like process safety management, emergency preparedness and response, hot work permitting, and training.  \n\nAdditionally, we believe employee involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.

They are: a) Plant Safety Steering, b) S*A*F*E Steering, c) Contractor Safety, and d) PSM.  The teams present summary reports of their activities and improvements to senior management each quarter.\n\nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually of the natural type, such as hurricanes, or freezes.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of on-site emergencies such as spills, fire, explosion or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Sterling Fibers provides the emergency response teams with state-of-the-art equipment and the latest training and procedures.  This ensures prompt mitigation actions during incidents and rapid notification to any surrounding neighborhood that may be inadvertently affected by a plant emergency.  \n\nWe maintain policies and procedures covering response teams that make up the overall emergency preparedness and response program for the plant.  The plant has created several teams to respond to various emergencies.  The Plant Emergency Response Team (PERT) is comprised of volunteer individuals from various departments that perform assigned functions in their aligned areas.  The team is also known as the Fire Brigade and is broken down as: a) Fire Response, b) Rescue Response, and c )HazMat Support.

Sterlings' synthetic acrylic fibers, which are non-toxic, are used for such consumer products as apparel, blankets, upholstery, and carpets.\n\nThe Sterling Fibers Santa Rosa Plant is located in Section 31, Township 1 North, Range 29 West in Santa Rosa County, about 15 miles northeast of Pensacola.  The plant's physical address is 5005 Sterling Way, Pace, Florida, Santa Rosa County.\n\nThe Santa Rosa Plant employs approximately 281 staff and 57 contract personnel and currently operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n\nWe presently handle three regulated chemicals which are considered hazardous by EPA, Acrylonitrile, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, and Chlorine.  However, only Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore are included in our risk management program.  \n\nIn addition, Sterling Fibers, Inc. is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2824).

Based on EPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) parameters, Sterling Fibers has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic materials handled on-site.  It involves Acrylonitrile.  This scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint) resulting from an accidental release.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of any of the hazardous materials listed under the RMP rule as determined by EPA.  The EPA mandates companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance.  Only passive mitigation efforts such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to inititate are allowed to be considered.  An example of passive mitigation is diking which provides a secondary containment system designed to contain 110% of all chemical leaks/spills and to prevent any chemicals from getting to the groundwater or surface water.  \n\nToxic Substances:  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Endpoints).  Each of the regulated toxic substances at Sterling Fibers was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  Based on the EPA lookup tables, a worst-case release of acrylonitrile results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.1 miles.  The worst-case scenario for acrylonitrile assumes the total failure of a single storage tank into a diked area with the maximum possible amount (745,000 lbs) in the tank at the time of its failure.  \n\nFlammable Substances:  None\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA rule also prescribes that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemicals are identified.

Examples of active mitigation are an employee turning off a valve or using a spray hose to knock down vapors.\n\nToxic Substances:  One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances at Sterling Fibers to determine the distance to an endpoint for each.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\n3)  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Sterling Fibers has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSterling Fibers primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sterling Fibers periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\n\n4)  Operating Procedures:  Sterling Fibers maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n5)  Training:  To complement the written procedures for process operations, Sterling Fibers has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\n\n6)  Contractors:  Sterling Fibers uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, Sterling Fibers evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n7)  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):  Sterling Fibers conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n8)  Mechanical Integrity:  Sterling Fibers has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Notifications to the public by local officials can be accomplished through an automatic community alerting phone system, which Sterling Fibers and other local industries provide to the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management Office. Sterling Fibers conducts periodic emergency drills that involve local emergency response organizations.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSterling Fibers has several elements of the management system of the accidental prevention program in place to improve safety throughout the facility.  These elements are part of an overall ongoing safety improvement process at the plant.  \n\nThe MOC/PSSR Procedure is being reviewed in an effort to make the system more clearly defined and to continue the MOC and PSSR process.  The result will be a more \"readable\" document with improvements in clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  Additionally, forms and guides will be changed to enhance the purposes of the procedure and provide consistency of performance.  Combining the MOC and PSSR procedures will provide for a more natural workflow and will improve the emphasis on performance of PSSR's as a result of completing the MOC review.\n\nThe requirements set by the MOC/PSSR components of Sterling Fibers' PSM process are rigid and extensive by design in order to provide a good foundation for these two elements.  Improvements in these two areas of PSM will come by achieving closer adherence to the requirements of both components.\n\nA significant improvement for hazard reporting will be the development of the SAFE database.  The database allows electronic input of safety suggestions and hazards and a way to track them until resolved.  The database will also provide"

Further use of this database will enhance the ability of the plant to initiate programs to address the suggestions made or correct the hazards reported.  \n\nImprovement plans for Sterling Fibers' accident/incident investigation process include:\n\nSterling Fibers is in the process of developing a PSM awareness program on which all employees will be trained.  Information on the accident/incident investigation process will be included in the training package.  This will make employees more aware of opportunities for participation, access of investigation reports, etc.\n\nThe method by which recommendations arising from investigations are tracked will be improved.  Plans for improvement focus on improving our system for tracking recommendations generated by the investigation process and contained in the formal reports.\n\nSterling Fibers is currently seeking/evaluating software systems that will allow those who are responsible for corrective actions to input status of the recommendations directly into the computer network system.  This will eliminate mailing out the list of outstanding recommendations, written responses back to the Safety Department, and updating of the list by Safety and Health personnel.  This will result in status reports that are more current and closer to complete if not totally complete."
