              "Description": "The St. Cloud Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) falls under the EPA RMP 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.120 regulations for having an inventory on-site of chlorine gas over the threshold quantity of 2,500-lbs.  In lieu of these regulations, the St. Cloud WWTF has developed a prevention program to eliminate injury and/or death to the St. Cloud WWTF employees and the surrounding public in case of an accidental release.  Section 1: Introduction, Purpose and Management System - is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RMProgram understands their roles and responsibilities and those responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.  Responsibilities for each program element are assigned to specific St. Cloud WWTF employees.  Section 2: Employee Participation Plan - is to define how employees will be involved in the RMProgram.  The St. Cloud WWTF will provide an overview of the RMProgram, provide access to all RMProgram information required to safely perform their duties and will provide procedures on how to obtain this information.  Designated employees are listed under each program element.  Section 3: Process Safety Information - is to provide process safety information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine gas, the technology of the process and the equipment used in this process.  This is accomplished through annual employee right-to-know training.  Section 4: Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - describes how the St. Cloud WWTF will handle PHA to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with chlorine gas hazards.  The overall purpose of a PHA is to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental chlorine gas release.  Section 5: Operating Procedures - is to ensure that the St. Cloud WWTF maintains up-to-date and accurate written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) that provide clear instruction for the chlorination process.  SOP's for changing a cylinder, response to a leak while changing a cylinder, loading and unloading a cylinder are some of the procedures written in this section.  Section 6: Training - is to ensure that personnel working on or near chlorine is adequately trained and understands the inherent process hazards and appropriate response and action to an accidental chlorine release.  Section 7: Contractor Responsibility - is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the chlorine system.  Employer and contractor responsibilities are assigned.  Section 8: Pre-startup Safety Review - is to ensure safe operation of new and modified regulated processes.  For new capital construction projects, the Project Engineer will conduct the pre-startup safety review.  For modifications to the existing system, the Wastewater Services Manager is responsible to conduct the pre-startup safety review.  Section 9: Mechanical Integrity - is to establish, implement and maintain an ongoing mechanical integrity program that ensures process equipment and instrumentation to minimize the risk of an accidental chlorine gas release.  The Wastewater Services Manager will determine which equipment in the chlorine process is covered, establish written maintenance procedures, train maintenance personnel, perform inspections, maintain process equipment and correct equipment deficiencies.  Section 10: Hot Work Permit - is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination system.  The Wastewater Services Manager and all maintenance personnel are responsible for implementing this hot work permit procedure.  Section 11: Managing Change - is to make sure any system changes are properly reviewed against the original system specifications and be accomplished safely.  Section 12: Incident Investigation - is to document and investigate all incidents including \"near misses\" involving the release of chlorine gas to determine cause(s) and in order to prevent reoccurence.  The Wastewater Services Manager and the Water Quality Coordinator are responsible to initiate and follow-through the incident investigation.  Section 13: Emergency Response Plan - is to establish a procedure for the timely mitigation of hazardous material incidents within the property of the St. Cloud WWTF.  ERP training will be conducted for any new employee and will be reviewed annually for all other employees.  Section 14: Compliance Audits - is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate the St. Cloud WWTF's process safety and risk management programs.  The audit will identify recommendations to address program deficiencies.",

              "Description": "The St. Cloud Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) falls under the EPA RMP 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.120 regulations for having an inventory on-site of sulfur dioxide over the threshold quantity of 500 lbs.  In lieu of these regulations, the St. Cloud WWTF has developed a prevention program to eliminate injury and/or death to the St. Cloud WWTF employees and the surrounding public in case of an accidental release.  Section 1: Introduction, Purpose and Management System - is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RMProgram understands their roles and responsibilities and those responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.  Responsibilities for each program element are assigned to specific St. Cloud WWTF employees.  Section 2: Employee Participation Plan - is to define how employees will be involved in the RMProgram.  The St. Cloud WWTF will provide an overview of the RMProgram, provide access to all RMProgram information required to safely perform their duties and will provide procedures on how to obtain this information.  Designated employees are listed under each program element.  Section 3: Process Safety Information - is to provide process safety information pertaining to the hazards of sulfur dioxide gas, the technology of the process and the equipment used in this process.  This is accomplished through annual employee right-to-know training.  Section 4: Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - describes how the St. Cloud WWTF will handle PHA to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with sulfur dioxide gas hazards.  The overall purpose of PHA is to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental sulfur dioxide gas release.  Section 5: Operating Procedures - is to ensure that the St. Cloud WWTF maintains up-to-date and accurate written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) that provide clear instruction for the dechlorination process.  SOP's for changing a cylinder, response to a leak while changing a cylinder, loading and unloading a cylinder are some of the procedures written in this section.  Section 6: Training - is to ensure that personnel working on or near sulfur dioxide is adequately trained and understands the inherent process hazards and appropriate response and actions to an accidental sulfur dioxide release.  Section 7: Contractor Responsibility - is to ensure that only contractors with good health and safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the dechlorination system.  Employer and contractor responsibilities are assigned.  Section 8: Pre-startup Safety Review - is to ensure safe operation of new and modified regulated processes.  For new capital construction projects, the Project Engineer will conduct the pre-startup safety review.  For modifications to the existing system, the Wastewater Services Manager is responsible to conduct the pre-startup safety review.  Section 9: Mechanical Integrity - is to establish, implement and maintain an ongoing mechanical integrity program that ensures process equipment and instrumentation to minimize the risk of an accidental sulfur dioxide gas release.  The Wastewater Services Manager will determine which equipment in the dechlorination process is covered, establish written maintenance procedures, train maintenance personnel, perform inspections, maintain process equipment and correct equipment deficiencies.  Section 10: Hot Work Permit - is to ensure that a hot work permit is issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the dechlorination system.  The Wastewater Services Manager and all maintenance personnel are responsible for implementing this hot work permit procedure.  Section 11: Managing Change - is to make sure any system changes are properly reviewed against the original system specifications and be accomplished safely.  Section 12: Incident Investigation - is to document and investigate all incidents including \"near misses\" involving the release of sulfur dioxide gas to determine cause(s) and in order to prevent reoccurence.  The Wastewater Services Manager and the Water Quality Coordinator are responsible to initiate and follow-through the incident investigation.  Section 13: Emergency Response Plan - is to establish a procedure for the timely mitigation of hazardous material incidents within the property of the St. Cloud WWTF.  ERP training will be conducted for any new employee and will be reviewed annually for all other employees.  Section 14: Compliance Audits - is to ensure audits are performed to evaluate the St. Cloud WWTF's process safety and risk management programs.  The audit will identify recommendations to address program deficiencies.",

Presently the average daily flow is 10-MGD, design flow is 13-MGD.\n\nThe St. Cloud WWTF uses chlorine to disinfect the discharge effluent to the Mississippi River.  Chlorine is also used for process control measures.  Sulfur dioxide is used at the St. Cloud WWTF to eliminate the chlorine residual of the effluent before it reaches the Mississippi River.  The St. Cloud WWTF stores a maximum of 18,000-lbs of chlorine and 8,000-lbs of sulfur dioxide, both volumes are greater than the threshold limits stated is 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.120 regulations.\n\nA requirement of the RMP is an Off-Site Analysis Assessment of the potential impacts of a worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios.  An assessment of these scenarios is included with the RMP documents.  There have been no reportable accidents at the St. Cloud WWTF in the last five years.\n\nActive administrative and mitigation control measures are utilized to prevent an accidental release.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detectors are in place and checked monthly.  An audible alarm will sound if chlorine gas or sulfur dioxide gas leak is detected.  An accidental release of chlorine gas would take place in a fire and explosion proof building, slowing the release rate and decreasing the distance of travel.  \n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to reduce the risk of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas and prevent injury to the surrounding public and WWTF empl"
