      "SummaryText": "Worthington Foods manufactures a variety of prepared food products at our facility in Zanesville.   We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration systems.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nWorthington Foods takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration systems.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Engineering/Environmental Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Worthington Food's Zanesville Plant produces prepared food products for sale to the public.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Zanesville Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Reg"

The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation Program \n- Process Safety Information \n- Process Hazard Analysis \n- Operating Procedures\n- Training Program\n- Contractor Safety Program\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\nD.   Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the Zanesville plant over the past five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences. \n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Zanesville Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Zanesville Fire Department.\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWorthington Foods is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective, though there are no planned changes to improve safety at this point."
