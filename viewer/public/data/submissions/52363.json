(Polychemie) has reviewed and enhanced \npreviously existing accidental release procedures and emergency\nresponse policies.  These policies include:\n    *   an emergency response sequence\n    *   emergency response to fires, explosions, and environmental releases\n    *   notification and reporting to regulatory agencies in the event of a reportable release\n    *   emergency response to hurricanes, floods, and bomb threats\n    *   spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plan\n    *   identification and training of an emergency response team\n    *   emergency coordinator and regulatory call lists\n    *   emergency equipment list and location\n    *   sensitive materials storage list\n    *   material profiles and material safety data sheets for major raw materials on site. \n\nThere are five substances at the Polychemie facility that are regulated \nby the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR Part \n68.  These substances are used in various processes throughout the \nfacility to produce water treatment polymers.  Specifically, the facility\nproduces cationic polymers, polyamine, Mannich products, melamine \nformaldehyde acid colloid, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride \n(DADMAC), as well as other related products.  Substances that are used by\nPolychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable \nsubstances by 40 CFR Part 68 are as follows:\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n *   Aqueous Ammonia: 30 percent ammonium hydroxide (aqueous ammonia) is \n     used as a reactant in the EDC/Ammonia and other processes.  The \n     maximum amount of 30 percent ammonium hydroxide (aqueous ammonia)\n     stored on-site is 110,000 pounds (33,000 pounds pure ammonia).\n\n *   Epichlorohydrin: Epichlorohydrin is used as a reactant in "

The maximum quantity stored \n     on-site is 990,000 pounds.\n\n *   Ethylenediamine: Ethylenediamine is used as a reactant in the \n     polyamine and other processes. The maximum quantity stored \n     on-site is 60,000 pounds.\n\n *   Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in the Mannich \n     process,melamine formaldehyde acid colloid process, and in other \n     processes.  Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent \n     solution in water.  The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde \n     stored on-site is 55,000 pounds (20,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n     Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is used in the DADMAC and Mannich  \n     processes as a reactant. Dimethylamine is received and stored in anhydrous \n     form.  The maximum amount of anhydrous dimethylamine stored on-site is \n     approximately 1,800,000 pounds.\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention \nprogram along with chemical specific prevention steps has been developed. \nThe key parts to the program are:  \n\n     *    Written operating procedures and emergency shutdown procedures.\n     *    Engineering controls to include that all valves fail in the safe position on loss of motive power. \n          Safe position is \"closed\" in most cases.\n     *    Emergency responders trained in the plant.\n     *    Contract emergency responders on 24-hour call.\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety \nManagement (PSM) requirements for several chemicals including \ndimethylamine, epichlorohydrin and formaldehyde.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility also has an emergency response program (ERP) in association \nwith the implementation  of the Risk Management Program.  The ERP will \nbe coordinated with the local fire department.  As part of community \ninvolvement efforts, the facility's management has coordinated an \nemergency response drill with t"
