The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees, and visitors is controlled by fencing and security checkpoints.  One of the chemicals utilized in the wet corn milling process at the Hammond facility  is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, propylene oxide (PO).  The starch modification and cyclodextrin process areas each use PO. These areas contain the only processes at the facility that are subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes, denoted as Program 1, 2 and 3. Program 1, which has minimal requirements, applies to facilities for which a worst-case release would not affect off-site receptors.  Program 3 applies to facilities with NAICS codes listed in the regulation or that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  Program 2 applies to all other facilities.  Cargill has elected to comply with Program 3, the program with the most rigorous RMP requirements.  The Program 3 accident prevention program encompasses the requirements of PSM.  Program 3 related information for the starch modification and cyclodextrin production areas is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nPropylene oxide is delivered by railcar to a 29,835-gallon capacity storage tank located in the starch area.

In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst-cases\" defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Cargill to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case and alternative cases are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n\n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Propylene Oxide\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  If not contained by a dike or berm, toxic liquids like PO are assumed to spill instantaneously and spread to a depth of 1 cm. The duration of the release is based on the evaporation rate of the toxi"

The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic \"endpoints\", is considered the worst-case release for each facility.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation of the worst case release.\n\n\n\nEPA has established \"toxic endpoints\" for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\n\n\n\"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-site Consequence (EPA 550-B-99-009) identifies modeling methods to estimate the spill rate, emission rate and resultant distance to toxic and flammable endpoints for worst-case and alternative releases.  EPA has developed a computer program RMP*CompTM that follows this guidance. RMP*CompTM was used in this assessment.\n\n\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies \"surface roughness\" as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion and influences the distance to toxic endpoint.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. Within and in the immediate vicinity of the Cargill Hammond facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is 'urban' in nature.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducte"

Analysis of five years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Chicago, Illinois (O'Hare Airport) indicates that this combination of wind speed and stability occurs approximately 3% of the time (about 1 hour per day, on average). The most predominant directions of transport are to the northeast. \n\n\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Hammond facility consists of an instantaneous release of 207,000 pounds of propylene oxide from the storage tank and subsequent evaporation from the diked area, dispersed during worst-case atmospheric conditions of stability class F and 1.5 m/s wind speed. In accordance with the off-site consequence analysis guidance, the temperature of the substance and the air are assumed to be 77o F. RMP*CompTM results indicated that the PO release would result in a distance to \"toxic endpoint\" of 0.5 miles. The worst-case endpoint distance encompasses a resident population of approximately 720 persons, estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program. The potential worst-case hazard zone includes residences, recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas.  No environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) would be affected.\n\n\n\n3.2 Alternative Release of Propylene Oxide\n\n\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.

Engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records were utilized to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts.  Each scenario was evaluated and the scenario most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts was selected for modeling. \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  According to EPA guidance, default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere (D stability) and a 3 m/sec wind speed.  These conditions can occur when the sky is overcast or during the morning or evening hours. A review of climatological data for Chicago, Illinois (O'Hare Airport), confirmed that conditions of D stability and wind speeds of 3 m/sec and greater are typical of the area, and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and for both active and passive mitigation.  Alternative release dispersion modeling was also conducted using RMP*CompTM.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative propylene oxide release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break along the pipe from the storage area to the reactor area.  A break of this type would result in the release of propylene oxide from the pipe at a release rate conservatively estimated to be 620 lbs/min.  Cargill has estimated that it would take plant personnel approximately 30 minutes to respond and shut down the flow, resulting in a total release of 18,600 lbs.

This means that during this period, no release of a substance presently regulated under RMP has resulted in reportable on-site or off-site injury, off-site evacuation or shelter-in-place, significant on-site property damage, or off-site damage to property or the environment.  \n\n\n\n6 .0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\n\n\nCargill's Hammond plant has established an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect the public health and the environment, as well as the safety of the plant employees.

      "SummaryText": "The EAP is designed to address foreseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency response personnel, and the community.  Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb threats, weather emergencies and other natural emergencies.  Cargill has developed procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency and a command structure to evaluate the emergency to determine the appropriate corrective action.  Cargill's Hammond facility has Emergency Response Personnel made up of plant employees from all areas of the plant and are trained in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.0, Emergency Awareness and Response Training Program.  Cargill will rely on the Hammond Fire Department, Hammond Police Department, the Lake County Sheriff, and area ambulance/paramedic services for assistance as required to control and resolve emergencies.\n\n\n\nPlant operation at the Hammond facility can present various types of potential hazards and Cargill recognizes the need to have a well-trained and prepared workforce to safely and effectively deal with emergency situations.  A preventative maintenance program to inspect and test emergency response equipment has been established.  Training programs including classroom and drills have been established to ensure that Emergency Response Personnel can respond to emergencies.  Emergency response training exercises have included the Hammond Fire Department, area ambulance/paramedic services, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  As specified in the Emergency Action Plan at the Hammond facility, representatives from the Hammond plant will attend the LEPC meetings, participating in the coordination and pre-planning of emergency activities and maintaining important communication links with the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\n\n\nCargill's Hammond plant, under the recent R"

      "SummaryText": "MP program, as well as its existing PSM and earlier SARA Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs, has organized its management system to effectively address foreseeable hazards and potential risks.  Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are documented so that information about safe handling of chemicals at the facility is readily available to all employees and in the event questions arise from public officials regarding potential risks to the community.  In addition, Cargill's Hammond facility safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of on-going evaluations of safety and programs.  The Hammond facility will continue to explore chemical substitution, process modifications and additional safety equipment that can reduce the risk for on and off site impact of potential releases.  All of these features of the RMP at the Hammond plant lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even safer tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan      Executive Summary          October, 2002\n\n\n\n"
