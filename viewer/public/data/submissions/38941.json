The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Roemerman Feed and Grain are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 156,000 pounds in one 12,000 gallon storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nNOT LISTED\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia? and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship Rules.\n\n5.
