      "SummaryText": "nd in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Cogen 42 has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following automatic / manual shutdown, ammonia sensors in the process area, automatic deluge system, well designed relief system, safety showers/eye wash stations, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nKey Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Cogen 42 to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The covered process has over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM threshold quantities.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention \n\nCogen 42 has developed a Risk Management Program and an Emergency Response Plan to address CalARP Program requirements (19 CCR \u00a72735-2785). Cogen 42 has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Injection System.  Cogen 42's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nCogen 42 is located at 25121 North Sierra Highway, Newhall, California 91321.  The regulated substance at the Facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 9,750 gallons (50,213 pounds [lbs]) and it is stored in a pressurized horizontal storage vessel (V-511) at ambient temperature in liquid form.  When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor.  The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air.  The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of NOx and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment.  The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of NOx is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary: Per CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Injection System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary: An alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can be fou"
