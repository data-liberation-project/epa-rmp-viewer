      "SummaryText": "1) Company's Prevention and Emergency Response Approach- Plastomer Corporation has coordinated its Risk Management Plan with the LEPC.  2) Description of the Stationary Source- The Facility manufacturers polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) along with water, catalyst, and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.  The facility stores and uses quantities of toluene diisocyanate in excess of the threshold quantities specified in the 40 CFR 68.115, which is 10,000 lbs. The toluene diisocyante is stored in one 10,000 gallon carbon steel TDI storage tank located inside the facility.  This storage tank is surrounded by a containment wall or dike.  TDI is pumped from the storage tank to the production line where it is mixed with other chemicals and reacts to form polyurethane foam. 3) Description of the worst-case scenario- The worst case release analyzed was the loss of the entire contents of the 10,000 gallon TDI storage tank.  After using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres Model (ALOHA), Plastomer Corporation determined that the distance to the endpoint would not impact a public receptor.  The release rate and distance to endpoint stated in the Toxic Worst Case section of this report are higher than the values actually calculated by the ALOHA software.  The limitations of this RMP Submit Software required Plastomer Corporation to enter values that were higher than calculated by the ALOHA software.  The actual values calculated for the distance to the endpoint are considered to be company confidential.  4) The actions taken at the facility to prevent accidental releases include the following: a) periodic inspection of all lines, pumps, valves for leaks, corrosion, operational failures b) manual inspection of the tank levels prior to unloading to ensure adequate space is available c) unloading operations are not left una"
