The site has a direct communications link to off-site responders in the case of emergency.  Hazmat team members are trained for Emergency Response and Fire-Fighting and participate in drills regularly.  Processes and equipment have combustible vapor detectors, water monitors, emergency shut-down instrumentation.\n\n Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely modified to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, and incident investigations.\n\nProcess hazard analysis and pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to commissioning of new or modified equipment or processes.  The process hazard analysis includes reviews of potential deviations from normal operating conditions and development of corrective actions to minimize risk and occurrence of deviations.\n\nEmployees perform incident investigations to determine root cause of incidents and to develop corrective actions to minimize risk and chance of re-occurrence.\n\nSome recent process revisions implemented to improve safety include:\n\n7 Installed redundant instrumentations on oxide reactors.\n7 Revised control logic to improve safety interlocks.\n7 Installed hardwired interlocks for shutdown.\n7 Year 2000 computer compliancy.\n7 Installed motion detector on agitator shaft in addition to horsepower reading"
