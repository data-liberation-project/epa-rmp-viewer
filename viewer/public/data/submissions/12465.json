BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors.  These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n7 We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n7 We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n7 We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\n7 Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n7 An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n7 We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.  We take any action judged to be necessary, whether or not dictated by statutory obligation or official regulations.\n7 We encourage safety, environmental and health awareness among employees.\n7 We regard it as an important corporate duty to advance science and technology in order to improve safety and environmental protection.\n7 We carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of new discoveries and technologies in dialogue with scientists and society before deciding on how "

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Clear Lake Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Clear Lake Site uses Ethylene Oxide (EO) and Propylene Oxide (PO).  These chemicals are used to manufacture Specialty Products such as surfactants and esters.  Our surfactacts and performance chemicals are used in consumer products and industrial applications as detergents, cleaning agents, and personal care products.\n\n Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n7 10-minute release of Ethylene Oxide from a railcar with off-site impacts. \n\nAlternative\n\n7 A gasket failure on the ethylene oxide transfer line with off-site impacts. \n7 A gasket failure on the propylene oxide transfer line with off-site impacts. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.\n\nSignificant chemical-specific prevention and mitigation steps found at the Clear Lake site include:\n7 Being prepared to handle unexpected rises in temperature and pressure by using automatic shut-off device and relief valves.\n7 Multiple layers of protections such as safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors.\n7 Identifying potential problems by continuously monitoring pressure in vessels and piping.\n7 Ensuring proper operation by regularly inspecting equipment.  \n7 Ensuring employees and contractors receive extensive emergency response, health care and safety training following regulatory and corporate guidelines.\n7 Training employees in start-up, operation, and maintenance of all equipment.\n7 Investigating safety and chemical related incidents and implementing corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence.\n7 Obtaini"

The site has a direct communications link to off-site responders in the case of emergency.  Hazmat team members are trained for Emergency Response and Fire-Fighting and participate in drills regularly.  Processes and equipment have combustible vapor detectors, water monitors, emergency shut-down instrumentation.\n\n Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely modified to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, and incident investigations.\n\nProcess hazard analysis and pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to commissioning of new or modified equipment or processes.  The process hazard analysis includes reviews of potential deviations from normal operating conditions and development of corrective actions to minimize risk and occurrence of deviations.\n\nEmployees perform incident investigations to determine root cause of incidents and to develop corrective actions to minimize risk and chance of re-occurrence.\n\nSome recent process revisions implemented to improve safety include:\n\n7 Installed redundant instrumentations on oxide reactors.\n7 Revised control logic to improve safety interlocks.\n7 Installed hardwired interlocks for shutdown.\n7 Year 2000 computer compliancy.\n7 Installed motion detector on agitator shaft in addition to horsepower reading"
