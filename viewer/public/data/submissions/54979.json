We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five year accident history for accidental releases of chemical regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n* The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces products used by the friction materials and coatings industries using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\n\n1. Epichlorohydrin\n2. Ethylenediamine\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of theses chemiclas.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRA"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful programs, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Pre-startup review\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractor management\n\nAs aprt of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical specific prevention steps:\n\n1. Trained personnel are stationed at the tank wagon unloading area during all tank wagon unloadings.\n2. Each chemical has a specific procedure for unloading, with all necessary precautions and safety steps specified.\n3. Epichlorohydrin tank has a high level alarm with pump interlock and a high-high level alarm.\n4. Ethylenediamine has high and high-high level alarms.\n5. Computer inventory control to maintain tank levels always below maximum capacity.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental releases that occur at our facility. The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases invloving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past 5 years:\nThere were no releases within the last 5 years of this report submission date.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency responders; the Newark Fire Dept., Hazmat team, NJDEP, and local medical emergency teams.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are no further improvents presently planned.\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\n\nWithin the past 5 years, the"
