      "SummaryText": "The goal of Agrifos' chemical accident prevention efforts is to ensure there are no chemical releases that threaten public health, employee safety or the environment.  To accomplish this goal Agrifos manages risk through layers of protection including, but not limited to, equipment/process design, safety inspections, employee training, HAZOP's, management of change, and emergency drills.  The Pasadena Plant's Emergency Preparedness Manual delineates roles and responsibilities during plant emergencies.  The Emergency Preparedness manual also summarizes and documents the Pasadena facility's policies regarding accidental chemical releases and emergency responses.\n\nAgrifos' Pasadena facility is located in Harris County on the South shore of the Houston Ship Channel at 2001 Jackson Road, Pasadena, Texas 77506.  This facility manufactures sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid which are used at the Pasadena facility to produce ammonium phosphate and ammonium thiosulfate fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia, an important plant nutrient used in the manufacture of fertilizers, and chlorine used for water treatment are the only substances at this facility that satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Subpart F.  Agrifos has three covered processes at the Pasadena facility, ammonia storage, chlorine at the CIWA water treatment area and chlorine at the sulfuric acid plant cooling tower.  Agrifos has one prevention program for all covered processes at the Pasadena facility.\n                                                                        \nRisk Management covers all aspects of a manufacturing facility from design and construction, through start-up and operation, to maintenance and training.  Accidental release prevention is an ongoing process requiring frequent monitoring and testing of equipment, management systems and people to ensure the safety of employees and the community and to protect the environment.\n\nIndustry engineering standards are used throughout design and construction.

      "SummaryText": " Pre-startup reviews include a safety review to ensure compliance with all OSHA standards.  Safety audits include periodic HAZOP's and monthly safety inspections.  Operating procedures are kept current.  Management of change procedures are strictly followed to ensure all proposed changes to equipment, operating procedures and process conditions are thoroughly reviewed and receive management approval.  Safe work permits are routinely employed to assure maintenance activities are conducted properly and safely.  Pre-employment physicals include blood and urine testing for drugs and alcohol.  All employees receive on the job training prior to job assignment.  Monthly safety meetings and annual safety training are an integral part of the plant's accident prevention program.         \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a tank within a tank.  The tank is equipped with redundant level controls which are remoted to a control room and equipped with high level alarms.  Plant policy limits maximum level to 90% of design.  Emergency pressure relief valves are located on top of the storage tank to protect the vessel from excessive pressure.  Like the level indicators, pressure indicators are remoted to a control room where they are recorded on a 24-hour circular chart.  A vapor re-compression system eliminates routine venting from the tank.  Emergency power and air supply are available.  Interlocks, excess flow devices, check valves, in line stack monitors, process area detectors and scrubbers provide additional protection against accidental releases.\n\nChlorine is used at the CWA water treatment plant, sulfuric acid plant cooling tower, and potable water system to deter algae growth and to purify the water.  The chlorine is stored in 1 ton cylinders at the CWA treatment plant and SAP cooling tower and does not exceed 8,000 pounds within the covered processes.  The chlorine at the potable water system is stored in 150 pound cylinders and does not exceed 450 pounds.  The cylinders are "

The Plant also conducts emergency drills for all employees on all shifts to test the Plant response and to improve the plan where necessary.  The Plant also maintains an emergency response team with coverage around the clock.  The team is trained and equipped to handle fires, rescues and HAZMAT incidents.  The Plant is also a member of the CIMA mutual aid emergency response organization.\n\nThe Plant has a number of processes in place to provide for the continuous improvement of safety.  Safety policies and procedures are reviewed and updated regularly.  New policies and procedures are developed as necessary.  Safety training is conducted for all employees monthly.  All accidents and incidents are investigated and results reviewed and tracked.  An annual program evaluation is written with an action plan for improvement.  An employee safety committee meets monthly to discuss current safety issues and to address any safety concerns.  Specific changes designed to improve Plant safety are summarized in the Agrifos Safety Plan.\n"
