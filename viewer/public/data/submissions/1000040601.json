Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Gerawan Farming Plant 2 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Gerawan Farming Plant 2, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Gerawan Farming Plant 2 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name    |    Process Chemical       |       Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nPlant 2.0            Anhydrous Ammonia              84,000\n\nPlant 2.1            Anhydrous Ammonia              59,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n- Prepar"

Plant 2 has two ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit. Twenty rooms are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, twelve others are designated cold storage rooms, one is designated for Quality Control and one for Preconditioning of Fruit. Several hallways and the loading dock are also refrigerated. Computer systems also provide substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nEach system operated as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted either on the roof or in the bunkers. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to main suction accumulators which separate any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge gas from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. \n\n\n\nLiquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suctio"

Operation of float switch activated solenoid valves raise the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers. There are three high pressure receivers; two in the west engine room and one in the east engine room. \n\n\n\nThe systems were built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance industry standards. They were also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction of each. The systems contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. Lastly, an emergency control box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia from each system if necessary.\n\n\n\nEach ammonia system at Gerawan Farming Plant 2 consists of vessel, pipe, and equipment that is interconnected, but the systems are not directly connected to each other or co-located. As such, Gerawan Farming Plant 2 has two refrigeration processes.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nGerawan Farming Plant 2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of th"

Both ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 143,000 lbs. It is extremely important that these processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor both ammonia refrigeration processeses and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the processes are checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nGerawan Farming Plant 2 has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nGerawan Farming Plant 2's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nGerawan Farming Plant 2 has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

This has improved Gerawan Farming Plant 2's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Gerawan Farming Plant 2's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nGerawan Farming Plant 2 has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Gerawan Farming Plant 2 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Gerawan Farming Plant 2 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Gerawan Farming Plant 2 employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Gerawan Farming Plant 2 will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. "
