The City of Fort Scott Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. Al applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The Water Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to the facility itself and to emergency response services available in the community, and are in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirments.\n\nB. The City of Fort Scott Water Treatment Plant chlorine system was installed to disinfect the water supply for the City as well as for Bourbon County Consolidated Water District #2. The water treatment facility includes a chlorination room, which contains two (2) on ton chlorine cylinders, two chlorine vacuum regulators which are attached directly to the cylinders, flowmeters, ventilation system, and a chlorine alarm system. The treatment facility is manned 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Water treatment plant operators monitor the chlorine feed system at two hour intervals while the plant is in operation.\n\nC. The general Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:\n1. Operator Training\n2. Preventive maintenance program.\n3. Use of up to date process and safety equipment.\n4. Use of effective operating procedures, written with operator participation.\n5. Hazard review of equipment maintenance and inspection program.\n6. Implementation of a preventive maintenance and inspection program.\n7. All operators have been trained on Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and are aware of the hazard and toxic properties of chlorine.\n\nD. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nE. The facility has a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan, which has been reviewed by the City of Fort Scott Fire Department and the, Bourbon County Loca"
