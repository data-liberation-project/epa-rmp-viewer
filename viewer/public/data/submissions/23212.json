As such, everyone is responsible for preventing incidents.\n\n\u00b7  Training is essential.  The more knowledgeable we are, the fewer mistakes we make.\n\n\u00b7  It is not possible to meet our business goals withour meeting health, safety and environmental goals. \n\nDescription of Plant Process Covered under 40 CFR Part 68\n\nThe Rhodia Inc. Baltimore Plant is engaged in the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.  The specialty chemicals are primarily reactive monomers.  \n\nThe sole process covered under the 40 CFR Part 68 (Risk Management Plans) is the Sulfation Process which utilizes 30% aqueous ammonia for the neutralization of sulfated alcohols in the manufacture of surfactants (for example: detergents)\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nThe worst case release scenario selected for the Sulfation Process is the complete loss of the contents of one full ammonium hydroxide trailer within 10 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14mg/L) is 0.2 miles.  There is no residential population within a circle of 0.2 miles from the unloading location ( the circle of influence).  Public receptors within the circle of influence include only industrial or heavy commercial businesses"
