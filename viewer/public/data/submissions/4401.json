The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with TNRCC 317\nDesign Criteria for Sewerage System.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of\nthe release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSouth Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, South Wastewater\nTreatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various\nmodes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency\nshutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nSouth Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated\nwith these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as\nneeded.\n\nMaintenance\nSouth Wastewater Treat"

Process equipment examined by these checks\nincludes among others; one ton chlorine cylinder, piping systems, relief and vent systems,\nscrubber system, and controls.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with\nprevious training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nSouth Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\nprovisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 03/31/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any\ncorrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSouth Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or\ncould reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n5.   Five-year Accident History\nSouth Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\n6.   Emergency Response Plan\nSouth Wastewater Treatment Plant follows a written emergency response plan to deal with\naccidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning,"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at South Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is sewage wastewater treatment.  We have 1 regulated substance\npresent at our facility.  This substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant.\n\n\n3.   The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The following\nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 (chlorine toxic substance) involves a\ncatastrophic release from our chlorine injection process.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of chlorine is\nreleased.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  A passive mitigation system such as an enclosure is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 3.5 miles is obtained\ncorresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from our chlorine i"
