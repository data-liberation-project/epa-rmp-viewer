We have developed and implemented programs to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment, including those that satisfy Braskem's corporate standards and applicable government requirements.  Despite this area not being PSM covered, Braskem's programs satisfy or exceed all applicable requirements under both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP). In order to ensure that our programs remain fully compliant, we periodically re-validate our Process Hazard Analyses (\"PHAs\") for covered processes, and choose to include the railyard in these analyses to ensure that process hazards remain properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated.  We also utilize these PHA revalidations to identify opportunities for further safety enhancements as needed. Braskem also conducts periodic compliance audits to ensure maintenance of administrative policies and mitigation controls to help prevent accidents and releases. The facility manager retains primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility.  In addition, all employees participate in safety related teams, projects, audits, and other activities and are trained to adhere to established policies and procedures. In addition, the Marcus Hook facility has a dedicated Emergency Response Team, consisting of fully trained members.  An Emergency Response Team is available during each shift.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThis railcar storage area is located in Delaware, is a set of track space used for staging rail"

Cars are moved by a third party train operator to, from, and throughout the storage area. At no point does Braskem move railcars in this facility, and therefore does not have any full time equivalent employees on site, but does complete periodic inspections as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nRailcars are spotted for one of the following purposes: 1) empty hopper cars awaiting non-hazardous finished product to be loaded from within the Marcus Hook Polymers facility, 2) loaded hopper cars containing non-hazardous finished product awaiting final shipment from the facility to a customer or other shipping point, 3) full LPG cars awaiting movement to the raw material unloading area of the facility to be offloaded and the material processed, or 4) empty LPG cars that have already been offloaded awaiting final return to the raw material supplier. \r\n\r\nThe railyard may contain up to 240 total railcars, and therefore has the potential to maintain inventories of propylene and propane in quantities exceeding the 10,000 lb threshold for each constituent under the EPA RMP program. The railyard does not maintain inventories of any other material in excess of its applicable EPA RMP threshold. The facility's RMP program ensures that all constituents in the railcars, whether or not above the RMP threshold, are safely managed by confirming the railcars are maintained in accordance with applicable DOT regulations. These materials are flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration. The facility handles these materials under pressure in both gaseous and liquid forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe elements of the facility's Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs are distributed among site personnel, coordinated by the Facility Manager and Lead Engineer.

In addition, Braskem coordinates with state and local agencies in addressing PSM and RMP program considerations, including through involvement of such agency personnel in facility training activities.  \r\n\r\nBraskem also ensures that equipment design satisfies Braskem's RMP and PSM standards.  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or government requirements. \r\n\r\nIn order to properly address Process Safety Information, Braskem documents relevant chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information, and ensures that such information is maintained up-to-date, and made available to operating personnel.  Braskem also conducts PHAs to identify worst case scenarios and available preventative action(s). Layers of Protection Analysis: LOPA's are conducted where warranted by the identified hazards. The protection layers identified through each LOPA are maintained to ensure continued availability of adequate protection.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures reflect safe operating practices for each affected process.  The facility updates all operating procedures to reflect any relevant changes.\r\n\r\nOperator Training / Certification Program: A formal training and testing program is used to ensure that operators have proper skills and knowledge prior to independently operating the process.\r\n\r\nTechnical Staff Training and Support: Trained technical staff employees are available 24 hours per day to support operations. \r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: Specific procedures are developed to safely maintain applicable equipment. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Program: Rail cars are inspected and maintained per DOT regulations.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: A management system is used to ensure that any modifications to affected"
