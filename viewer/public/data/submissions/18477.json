We follow OSHA's Process Safety Management procedures to ensure safe working practices, and to eliminate any possible safety problems.  We also plan to reduce the amount of the chemical held in storage.  We continue to have a perfect safety record with these chemicals and with the safety procedures in place, our record should remain perfect.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario (such as the bursting of a tank, releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department and Eagle Environmental Services) and governmental agencies would be contacted immediately.
