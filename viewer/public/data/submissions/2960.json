This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Processing of Water and Wastewater Treatment.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Ammonia and Sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is used for disinfection.  Ammonia is used for combating trihalomethanes(THM).  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.                                         .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 16000.00 lb. while Ammonia  and Sulfur dioxide are expected to be present at our facility in quantities of 7000.00 lb. and 6000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Water Treatment.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep po"

The released quantity has been limited to  20% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide involves a release from Wastewater Treatment.  The scenario involves the release of 500 lb. of \nSulfur Dioxide .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by water curtain(s), neutralization and emergency shutdown system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.81 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Wastewater Treatment.  The scenario involves the release of 200 lb. of Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by water curtain(s), neutralization and emergency shutdown system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.62 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPr"
