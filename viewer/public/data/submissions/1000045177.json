This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nShaw's Southern Belle Frozen Foods, 821 Virginia Street, Jacksonville, Florida, is responsible for the manufacturing of frozen seafood. There are approximately 90 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  The plant manufactures product from 6:00 am to 4:30 pm, (5) five days a week. Shaw's Frozen Foods is located on the north west side of Jacksonville. The residential receptors in the community are predominantly located to the west and south-west of the plant.\r\n\r\nPresently anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for production and storage operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Shaw's Frozen Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n- Off Site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of those calculations are on file at the Shaw's Frozen Foods Facility.  Public and environment"

      "SummaryText": "al receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of Microsoft Streets mapping system software and CAPS, Circular Area Profiling System which uses US Census Bureau 2010 data.  To evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP COMP was utilized exclusively. \r\n\r\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nShaw's Frozen Foods has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Shaw's Frozen Foods is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\n- Emergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nShaw's Frozen Foods current Emergency Action/Response Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nShaw's Frozen Foods' currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews and compliance audits for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Shaw's Frozen Foods personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
