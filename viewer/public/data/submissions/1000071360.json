The requirements, codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A-H, require any facility that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process to comply with the requirements of the Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). \n\n\n\nRegulated flammable and toxic substances and their corresponding threshold quantities (TQ) (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) are identified for the purpose of determining applicability. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable), the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) flammable hazard rating of 4. Where toxic substances are found in greater than one percent by weight of a mixture, only the weight of the toxic substance is considered in threshold determination. Table 1 lists the regulated substances and the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe onsite in a covered process at the Shintech Plaquemine Plant (SPP).  See Appendix 1 for the definition of a process. The Complex currently incorporates the following facilities: Shintech Plaquemine Plant 1 (SPP-1), Shintech Plaquemine Plant 2 (SPP-2), Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 1 (HAPF-1), and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 2 (HAPF-2) and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 3 (HAPF-3).

The facility is designed as a vertically integrated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility that also produces intermediate products, including chlorine (and caustic soda as a byproduct), ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride monomer, and hydrochloric acid.This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Shintech is committed to operating this facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. Shintech has many years of experience and an excellent environmental and safety track record in the production of polyvinyl chloride. Shintech strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its a"

One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the facility. An initial RMP for the  facility was submitted to EPA via the RMP Submit Program in June 2008. According to LAC 33:III.Chapter.59, the registration was submitted to the LDEQ within 60 days of the stationary source becoming subject to this regulation. Shintech registered with LDEQ in June 2008. If anything changes within the registration, it will be submitted to LDEQ within 60 days of the change. Likewise, Shintech will update its RMP via RMP Submit and submit the changes to the EPA within 6 months of the change. \n\n\n\nThis document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility.\n\n\n\n2.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nShintech is committed to minimizing potential risks to the general public, to the facility employees, and to the environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well-trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and tra"

In addition to handling the release, the facility is also participating in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Develop and Implement a Management System (CFR 68.15)\n\n\n\nThe Shintech Environmental Manager is responsible for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program will be delegated to other personnel who will report either directly or through other management personnel to the Environmental Manager. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP offsite consequence analysis and five year accident history has been delegated to the Environmental Supervisor. The Safety/Security Supervisor is responsible for Emergency Response and Safety and Data Sheets (SDS) and Process Safety Information. Furthermore, it is the facility's policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job; therefore, many other site personnel will also be involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n2.2 Facility Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nSee Table 1 for list of regulated RMP substances that are above threshold in a process at the facility.\n\n\n\n2.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nBecause the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident pr"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program will be documented in an employee participation plan that will be maintained at the facility and will address each accident prevention program element.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe facility will keep a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. These documents will also need to be gathered for the Process Hazard Analysis. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining and updating process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns and hazards. In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals. Shintech will ensure that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nShintech will also maintain numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, the covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the What If, HAZOP, and Fault Mode and Effects Analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, experience, and engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility will periodically update and revalidate its process hazard analyses. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\n2.3.4  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Training \n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. All operations employees receive basic training in the facility operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. As required per 40 CFR 68.54, this refresher training is conducted every three years or more often if determined to be necessary. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Contractors\n\n\n\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its work force throughout the year as needed. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, possess the appropriate knowledge and skills needed, are trained of the hazards in the workplace, and are aware of the procedures to take in the event of an emergency. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process prior to their beginning work.
