The requirements, codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A-H, require any facility that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process to comply with the requirements of the Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). \r\n\r\nRegulated flammable and toxic substances and their corresponding threshold quantities (TQ) (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) are identified for the purpose of determining applicability. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable), the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) flammable hazard rating of 4. Where toxic substances are found in greater than one percent by weight of a mixture, only the weight of the toxic substance is considered in threshold determination. Table 1 lists the regulated substances and the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe onsite in a covered process at the Shintech Plaquemine Plant (SPP).  See Appendix 1 for the definition of a process. The Complex currently incorporates the following facilities: Shintech Plaquemine Plant 1 (SPP-1), Shintech Plaquemine Plant 2 (SPP-2), Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 1 (HAPF-1), and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 2 (HAPF-2) and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 3 (HAPF-3).

One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the facility. An initial RMP for the  facility was submitted to EPA via the RMP Submit Program in June 2008. According to LAC 33:III.Chapter.59, the registration was submitted to the LDEQ within 60 days of the stationary source becoming subject to this regulation. Shintech registered with LDEQ in June 2008. If anything changes within the registration, it will be submitted to LDEQ within 60 days of the change. Likewise, Shintech will update its RMP via RMP Submit and submit the changes to the EPA within 6 months of the change. \r\n\r\nThis document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the facility.\r\n\r\n2.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nShintech is committed to minimizing potential risks to the general public, to the facility employees, and to the environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.

Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.1 Develop and Implement a Management System (CFR 68.15)\r\n\r\nThe Shintech Environmental Manager is responsible for the development and implementation of the risk management program for the facility. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program will be delegated to other personnel who will report either directly or through other management personnel to the Environmental Manager. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP offsite consequence analysis and five year accident history has been delegated to the Environmental Supervisor. The Safety/Security Supervisor is responsible for Emergency Response and Safety and Data Sheets (SDS) and Process Safety Information.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program will be documented in an employee participation plan that will be maintained at the facility and will address each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\n2.3.2 Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe facility will keep a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. These documents will also need to be gathered for the Process Hazard Analysis. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining and updating process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns and hazards. In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals. Shintech will ensure that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nShintech will also maintain numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.
