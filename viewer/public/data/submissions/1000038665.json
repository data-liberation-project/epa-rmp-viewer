Kensico is one of the locations where some of the City's water is treated with chlorine.\r\nNew York City EP is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \r\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately notify the EP Police Eastview Precinct to mobilize EP's emergency response team to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through county emergency management agencies.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\r\nNYC EP is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, an individual, designated as the RMP Responsible Manager, has assumed overall responsibility for the implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP Responsible Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\nTo ensure a release scenario does not occur, the NYC EP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine. \r\n The multifaceted program includes the use of:\r\n\u00bf\u00ab\tChlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n\u00bf\u00ab\tProcess Safety Information to document the safe process design;\r\n\u00bf\u00ab\tProcess Hazards Analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\r\n\u00bf\u00ab\tOperating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\r\n\u00bf\u00ab\tMaintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the sys"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history.  \r\nEmergency Response\r\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Kensico Facility has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Fire Department. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the EP Police Eastview Precinct who would notify 60 Control and the Mount Pleasant Police Department call centers. The call centers would dispatch outside responders to the site to address the chlorine release. The Eastview Precinct Command Center would also notify DEP Operations and emergency response personnel to support the emergency response.\r\nMaintaining Safe Operation\r\nThe NYC EP continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect the community we serve and employees. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases. We will regularly conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe wo"
