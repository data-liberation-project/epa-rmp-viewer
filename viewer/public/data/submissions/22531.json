It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local laws and guidelines where applicable. If an emergency were to occur the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department would be immediately notified and requested to respond to the emergency. We also maintain and train a fire brigade to respond to small emergencies.\n\nThis facility is a packager of aerosol and liquid cleaning products. LPG is used as a propellent in many of the aerosol products packaged. The facility consists of 5-1,000 gallon, 1-5000 gallon and 1-6,565 gallon storage tanks. \n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the 6,565 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowed capacity of 52.5%, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The endpoint distance results in coverage offsite and encompasses several industrial buildings within an industrial park. Our alternative scenario is a break in a 1 inch pipe leading to a 10 minute release and explosion. The endpoint distance results in coverage offsite and encompasses several industrial buildings within an industrial park. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The LP-Gas storage system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving LP-Gas that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our LP-Gas system it is our policy to notify the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. We also have a trained fire brigade. Members of the fire department have inspected our facility so that they are familiar with our operation.\n\nThere are no planned changes to our safety program at this time. We constantly review our safety programs and institute revisions as seem appropriate t"
