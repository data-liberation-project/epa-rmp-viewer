      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Praxair facility at Pekin, Illinois is a carbon dioxide purification plant.  We receive carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct from a nearby chemical plant.   The carbon dioxide is transferred to our facility via pipeline, when we are running, or vented to the atmosphere when we are not.  Praxair purifies and liquefies the carbon dioxide using a process of compression, distillation, and drying.  The final liquid carbon dioxide product is stored in insulated tanks, and is shipped by truck and railcar to customers throughout the Midwest. \n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; Anhydrous Ammonia\nAs part of the carbon dioxide production process, the Pekin facility uses a standard ammonia refrigeration process to purify and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  Similar to the freon used in a home refrigerator, the ammonia is neither produced nor consumed in the process, but is repeatedly compressed, cooled and expanded in order to produce the cold temperatures necessary to cool and condense the carbon dioxide gas. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council\u00bfs program of Responsible"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity. \n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \n\nPraxair has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nAmmonia atmospheric levels are monitored and tied to an alarm for personnel protection.  The ventilation system automatically starts if the monitor goes into alarm.  The ammonia process is computer controlled, which automatically shuts the plant down if necessary.  Manual shutdowns are also located at various places throughout the plant.  Proce"

      "SummaryText": "ss equipment and piping is protected by a series of safety relief valves that will open should the pressure exceed design.  All safety relief valves are piped to a sparger tank that is filled with water.  Ammonia introduced to the sparger tank will automatically be neutralized with carbon dioxide.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Pekin  CO2  facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Pekin  location will be a \u00bfnon-responding facility\u00bf as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Tazewell County LEPC and the Pekin Fire Department. The local fire department generally makes an annual tour of the faciltiy.\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \u00bfZero/Zero\u00bf, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
