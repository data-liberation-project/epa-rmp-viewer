The facility was owned and operated by ACH. Bongards' South purchased the facility in March 2010.  This is the first submittal under Bongards' South.\n\nIn compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, the facility's Risk Management Program document, which is summarized by this plan, describes the following components of RMP:\n-\tA hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impact of worst-case and alternate release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n-\tAn accidental release prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, mechanical integrity, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving ammonia.\n-\tAn emergency action plan to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n-\tAn overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management system.\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with applicable regulations for the onsite refrigeration process covered by RMP regulations.\nThe facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature in food manufacturing operations.\nThe refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia at a stationary source in amounts greater than the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds, and a catastrophic release of this substance could impact public receptors.  Therefore, the facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving ammonia within the past 5 years.\nThe facility has performed a worst-case release scenario which estimates a potential loss of 6,350 pounds of ammonia which could potentially travel up to 0.4 miles.  In the alternative,"

Emergency actions for the facility have been coordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning commission.\nThe Risk Management Program will be revised as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable RMP regulations and to improve safety."
