The site organizes emergency response drills and conducts them quarterly. Plant tours are offered annually for public emergency responders to become familiarized with the facility layout, potential hazards and emergency response plans.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nHoneywell Muskegon maintains a commitment to continuously improving the safety of plant processes through improvement initiatives and measures that have been taken or are on-going.\r\nHoneywell Muskegon has one distillation unit (Still 7 and Receivers 3 & 4) used for processing ethyl ether, which utilizes carbon adsorption drums on the vent line. Planned changes to this system include: upgrading the configuration of the existing vent system, and modifying the carbon drum change out schedule. This improvement will further reduce the amount of ethyl ether vapors released to the atmosphere during the processing steps."

The RMP threshold quantity of chloroform is 20,000 lbs; the site can store up to 123,000 lbs. The stationary source of chloroform consists of a tanker unloading area and a bulk storage tank. Chloroform is purchased on an as needed basis, delivered via a tanker truck and unloaded by plant operators into an above-ground bulk storage tank which is located in the North Tank Farm. The RMP threshold quantity of ethyl ether is 10,000 lbs; the site can store up to 59,000 lbs. The stationary source of ethyl ether consists of a tanker unloading area and a bulk storage tank.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at the facility involves integration of Honeywell Standards along with senior management commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures and safe practices. Some of these elements include: employee participation in all PSM elements, safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the processes, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response plans, maintenance of emergency response equipment, coordination with local emergency response services and communicating with the community.

This policy includes the following elements: a) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the chloroform and ethyl ether processes; b) development and implementation of accurate procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process; c) an on-going mechanical integrity program that ensures critical process equipment is designed, constructed and installed in accordance to codes and standards and is also inspected, tested and proactively maintained; d) performance of process hazards analyses with resolution of recommendations and revalidating for inherently safer processes/technologies; e) use of safety shutdown, relief and vent systems, interlocks,"

The facility is a subsidiary of the Performance Materials and Technology sector of Honeywell International, headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey. The Muskegon plant was initially built in 1959 as Burdick & Jackson. The company became part of AlliedSignal Specialty Chemicals in 1996 which merged with Honeywell in 1999 keeping the Honeywell name. \r\n\r\nHoneywell Muskegon is committed to managing health, safety and the environment as a core business value to ensure compliance with all applicable government standards and regulations. The facility also integrates health, safety and environmental management into our business as a way of achieving profitable growth and accelerated productivity. Participation in the Responsible Care, program of the American Chemistry Council, has been achieved and the certification has been maintained since 2005. The Responsible Care is a chemical industry program focused on achieving improvements in health, safety and environmental performance beyond levels required by the U.S. government. The program directs companies to adopt practices for the safe use of materials, perform regular audits and to reach out and communicate with the communities in which the company operates.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 the site received HOS Silver certification and currently the site is preparing to apply for STAR status in the Michigan OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (MVPP). This voluntary program is a partnership between MiOSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs.  STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition MiOSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\r\n\r\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe plant is a high purity solvent manufacturing facility that has 81 fulltime equivalent employees.
