Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThis facility is regulated under 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency\nResponse and 29 CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans. Chemicals Incorporated fully complies with these regulations with employee training and written plans. Additionally, the facility is a member of Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu, the local emergency response group.\n\n2. Source and Substances Handled\nPrimary Activities: Specialty Chemical Toll Manufacturer\nUse of Substances:\n(I)\tHydrochloric Acid (toxic): 55,000 lbs (max) bulk storage tank (8,000 gallons) - 2 Nos.\n(II) Formaldehyde solution -37% (Formalin) (toxic): Generally approx.. 42,000 lbs in bulk storage tank-Generally in one storage tank, but a backup tank available. \n*III) Carbon disulfide (toxic): Total of 26,400 (max) lbs stored in 11 cylinders in Warehouse. Max in a cylinder is 2400 lbs.\n\n3. Consequence Analysis\n a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario:\n(I) Hydrochloric acid: Failure of a 4,000 gallon tank (80% full) of Hydrochloric Acid (37%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 174 minute period inside a diked (secondary containment) area of 11721 sq.ft and dike height of 1.5 ft. The 31,750 pounds (approx.) would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 2.7 miles.\n(II) Formaldehyde solution: Failure of a bulk storage tank of Formaldehyde solution (37%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of 42,000 pounds of contents. The 42,000 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.8 miles.\n(III) Carbon disulfide: Failure of a cylinder of Carbon disulfide with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of 2400 pounds of contents in diked area. The 2400 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.2 miles.\n\n\n b. Toxic Alternative Scenario:\n(I) Hydrochloric acid: Hole/rupture (1 inch"

The 21,200 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.2 miles.\n(III) Carbon disulfide: Hole/rupture (1 inch dia = 0.785 sq.inch) in cylinder of Carbon disulfide with no emergency response resulting in the release of contents over a 7 minute period. The 1620 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of <0.1 miles.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nChemicals Incorporated has made accident prevention the number one priority at the facility, and\nAccidental chemical release prevention is a major facet of the accident prevention activities at Chemicals Incorporated. Key to the prevention program is engineering controls, administrative controls, and comprehensive training of both operations and maintenance personnel.\n5. Five Year Accident History Summary:\nNo Accidents involving Hydrochloric Acid, Formaldehyde solution, and carbon disulfide.\n6. Emergency Response Program:\nChemicals Incorporated's Emergency Response Program is tailored to the varied processes inherent to a small specialty chemical toll manufacturer. The plan rests on response trained operators and a 24 hour a day emergency coordinator along with two alternate coordinators to handle notifications and request for response from outside agencies such as LEPC-Chambers County, MAMB, Mont Belvieu Fire Department, and ambulance services.\nSpecial equipment and personal protective gear is availabl"
