      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r), OSHA 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is resubmitting the EPA RMP to reflect changes in the overall program management at this Facility.  Helena recently acquired this Facility and has completed the transition from the prior owner PSM/RMP program to the Helena PSM/RMP program.   \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 139,915 lbs.  Although the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is stored and handled at the Facility is 139,915 lbs, the total quantity reported in this EPA RMP Report is 279,830 lbs.  The reason for this is because the single anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel (i.e. 139,915 lbs) is counted a second time to account for the APP Blending process that is connected to the single stationary pressure vessel.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  One chemical (i.e. anhydrous ammonia) is stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\r\n\r\no Covered Process 1: NH3 Storage and Handling\r\no Covered Process 2: Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Blending\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the two (2) covered processes.  The worst cas"

      "SummaryText": "e scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released. For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1 and 2), the worst case release was modeled as if the 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to a 3-inch transfer hose failure during a loading or unloading procedure associated with Covered Processes 1 and 2.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Operations Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\r\n\r\nCONC"

The PSM/RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Facility."
