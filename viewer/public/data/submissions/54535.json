In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous or aqueous ammonia release.  The facility utilizes a pressure relief valve, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 and Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  Prevention elements for each program are listed below.\r\n- Process Safety Information (PSI) \r\n- Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n- Operating Procedures (OP)\r\n- Training (TRN)\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (MI)\r\n- Management of Change (MOC) (anhydrous only)\r\n- Pre-Startup Review (PSSR) (anhydrous only)\r\n- Compliance Audits (CA)\r\n- Incident Investigation (II)\r\n- Employee Participation (EP) (anhydrous only)\r\n- Hot Work Permit (HWP) (anhydrous only)\r\n- Contractors (CON) (anhydrous only)\r\n- Emergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia at the"

The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored at the site.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 82% of the fill capacity. The total capacity stored onsite is 239,000 pounds.  This calculation is based on the number of gallons stored onsite and the weight of anhydrous ammonia per gallon.\r\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 24,500-gallon above ground tanks at the site.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24% active ingredient by weight, is 89,670 pounds. \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and one worst case has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and one alternative case has been defined for the Aqueous Ammonia Storage."

      "SummaryText": "facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\r\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia were addressed by the PHA.\r\n\r\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\r\nThe use of flammable materials at the Wilbur-Ellis Twin Cities Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \r\n\r\nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE\r\nThe use of flammable materials at the Wilbur-Ellis Twin Cities Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Twin Cities Facility is not a First Responding facility and therefore employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Wilbur-Ellis Twin Cities Facility has filed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 \u00a73220 to help coordinate with local responders.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe PHA study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the September 21, 2010 PHA Report.  Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by September 2011."
