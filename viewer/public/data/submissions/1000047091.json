      "SummaryText": "I. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nL'Oreal, USA (L'Oreal) is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment. This\r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel\r\nand considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility. L'Oreal's policy is\r\nto implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Well-defined\r\nsafety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including storage, handling, on-site\r\nmovement of chemicals, or any combination of these activities listed.\r\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility located in La Vista, Nebraska is a warehouse used for the distribution of cosmetic\r\nproducts. The facility currently receives and stores aerosol cans containing compressed gases and liquids.\r\nAerosol cans contain flammable mixtures. The flammable mixtures are found mainly as propellants in small\r\nquantities (in 6 to 16 ounce aerosol cans intended for use as household or salon products). The facility does\r\nnot have any regulated toxic substances.\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility is an EPA RMP Program 1 Level facility.\r\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical -Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following\r\nelements.\r\n- Safety Information: The L'Oreal Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe\r\noperation of the process. These documents address hazards of the aerosols at the facility, process\r\ntechnology, and process equipment.\r\n- Hazard Review: Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure\r\nthat adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n- Operating Procedures: The L'Oreal Facility uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training"

The Facility maintains the\r\nfollowing safety equipment: spill kits, fire extinguishers, non-sparking fork truck forks, and fire water sprinklers.\r\n- Training: The L'Oreal Facility has an effective emergency response training program for all employees, which\r\nincludes chemical spill response measures. The facility also has a comprehensive fork truck driver training\r\nprogram to minimize driver error.\r\n- Incident Investigation: The L'Oreal Facility has an Incident Investigation procedure in place in the event it will\r\nneed to be used.\r\nIV. Five-year Accident History\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been\r\nno accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\r\nV. Emergency Response Information\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility has developed and implemented written emergency response procedures to protect\r\nworker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such as: communication\r\nprocedures for responding to a chemical spill; response to a fire, severe weather response, security\r\nemergency, or medical emergency. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on\r\nfactors such as modification made to the site or change in the communication procedures.\r\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to improve employee training resources, safety information and conduct\r\nsafety audits and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve worker and pub"
