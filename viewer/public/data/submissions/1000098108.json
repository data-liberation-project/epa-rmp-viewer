EVOH is used in packaging food and other products requiring preservation by use of an oxygen barrier. MCA-SNL uses vinyl acetate (a listed RMP toxic chemical) and ethylene (a listed RMP flammable chemical) along with other non-RMP-regulated chemicals in the manufacture of EVOH. MCA-SNL is located on approximately 20 acres, employs approximately 110 company personnel and approximately 40 contract maintenance personnel. Access to the facility is controlled and limited to employees, contractors, consultants, and escorted visitors. MCA-SNL is a PSM covered facility and maintains compliance with all applicable safety, process safety, environmental, and transportation regulations. \n\nMCA-SNL is committed to the safe operation of the facility in the MCA-SNL Vision and Mission Statements and the MCA-SNL Integrated Management System Policy. The process safety systems at MCA-SNL are managed as a comprehensive and integrated unit. Because MCA-SNL is quality driven, the plant maintains living documents and audits all aspects of our operations. MCA-SNL applies the principles of continuous improvement to all its management practices. The MCA-SNL release prevention program applies to all processes and chemicals used at MCA-SNL and includes such diverse elements as: employee selection criteria; technical specifications which meet or exceed codes, standards, regulations, and common industry practices; fabrication and construction quality control; employee training programs in safety, environmental, process safety, process operations, and emergency response; standard operating procedures in operating and maintaining the facility; maintenance of process and mechanical integrity; employee involvement in safety and emergency response planning; coordination with and participation in mutual aid and community outreach activities; and incident investigation and recommend"

Many process vessels have redundant alarms and interlocks (i.e., temperature as well as pressure, level as well as temperature, etc.).  Health, safety and environmental audits are conducted weekly.  \n\nMCA-SNL maintains an emergency response team comprised of approximately 55 employees. The various members receive training in incident command, firefighting, hazardous material emergency response, and medical emergency treatment. Written safety, environmental, process safety management, and emergency response procedures are always available for review by all employees. MCA-SNL is a member of the East Harris County Manufacturers' Association (EHCMA), the La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee (LPLEPC) the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), and the Houston Regional Monitoring network (HRM). MCA-SNL is a supporter of the Community Action Emergency Response Line (EMERGE/CAER Line), a public notification system used in emergency and non-emergency situations.\n\nMCA-SNL has had 1 accidental releases of either ethylene or vinyl acetate in the past 5 years.  This event was a release of 12,856 pounds of vinyl acetate and 72 pounds of ethylene over a duration of 54 minutes.  This release did not result in offsite impacts or injuries.\n\n"
