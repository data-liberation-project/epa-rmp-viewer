      "SummaryText": "1.  The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Miller Farm Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140000.\n\n3.  The Worst-case Release Scenario:  This would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.6 miles.\n\nThe Alter-case Release Scenario:  This is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose with 12000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.  This case is assuming that excess flow valves malfunction.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  The regulations are administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture and are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process"

      "SummaryText": " in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  I have owned and operated this plant since 1983 and there have been no accidental releases of any reportable quantity in that time.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has written an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29CFR 1910.38  and provides state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plant has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operation.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
