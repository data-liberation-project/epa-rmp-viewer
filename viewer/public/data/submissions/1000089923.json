              "Description": "The Anhydrous Ammonia's Receiver Tank (4,757 lbs) is located outside in a (4' X 10' X 10') concrete spill containment. This Receiver Tank's piping goes through the outside wall into the Engine Room's four Compressors (There is one older back-up compressor). The Compressors send the Anhydrous Ammonia throughout the refrigeration system. Once the cycle has been completed the Anhydrous Ammonia is piped up to the Condenser located on the roof top to release the heat. Then the Anhydrous Ammonia is sent down to the two Accumulator Tanks - in the Engine Room, which then passes it on to the two Transfer Vessels. Once this has occurred the Ammonia goes back to the Receiver Tank and then through the entire process again.\n\n\n\nThe Engine Room has a sensing unit that is tied into a computer in the Boiler House and to the Maintenance Manager's/Engineering's Computer/Smart phones. This sensor also turns on the venting in the Engine Room. If the venting does not lower the Ammonia levels to a safe level a second alarm is generated. This system can be shut down remotely and/or manually outside the Engine Room. There is also an Anaerobic Digester that produces electricity which can keep the whole system operating in the event of a power failure.  \n\n\n\nThere is an addition of a Cellar W which is cooled by a Propylene Glycol Loop that is cooled by non-contact with the existing Anhydrous Ammonia system. No Anhydrous Ammonia is used in this new Cellar. The amount of Anhydrous Ammonia in the existing system - currently the system has 19,120 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia that may be increased to 22,000 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia at some time in the future if needed.",

      "SummaryText": "The Matt Brewing Company, its management and its employees are committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, neighbors and the community.  As such, the Matt Brewing Company has established procedures for the safe operation of its Facility and its processes.  Included in these procedures is a Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management policies that include methods to ensure the Facility's use of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system complies with federal and state safety and risk management requirements.  These procedures help to ensure that systems are in place to prevent accidental releases, and to manage them if they occur.   \n\n\n\nThe Facility's operations include brewing and bottling/canning of malt beverages and sodas.  As part of its operations, the Facility uses a closed loop Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for brewing and storage.  This assures that no Ammonia is released from the system unless there is a leak or an accidental release.  The Facility currently has 19,120 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system (This may be increased to 22,000 pounds in the future).  The Facility has not had to purchase any Anhydrous Ammonia in over seven years, because the anhydrous ammonia system is a closed loop system and there have been no accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  At all times a responsible Ammonia Refrigerant Engineer is on-site to respond to any accidental releases, leaks, or concerns.  All employees that work with, or around, the Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system have regularly scheduled training, and additional training when there are any changes - or it is otherwise deemed to be appropriate. The Facility's Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system is fully mapped out, pipes are painted different colors with directional markings and information about contents and pressures. Valves are also identified by tagging. \n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nAn automatic system is used that detects and responds to a leak and/or accidental release.  A backup manual system can also be used if necessary.  A venting system automatically turns on in the event a spill or leak of Anhydrous Ammonia is detected, and a notice is sent automatically to the Boiler Room's main computer, the Engineer staff's smart phone as well as to personal phones.  If the venting does not control the leak, alarms are sent out.  If necessary, the Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system can be shut down from either the boiler room's computer or the emergency stop buttons at any of 3 entrances to the engine room.  In addition there are automatic valves installed on the two condensers located on the Facility's roof, which work with the system to control pressure.\n\n\n\nIn case of an accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia from the Facility, the Facility has emergency response procedures in place that include coordination with local emergency responders thereby providing notification to the community.  To ensure the local emergency responders and Facility personnel are prepared, the Facility has conducted both table-top and full scale drills, and participates at regular meetings, with local emergency responders. We are currently discussing conducting a virtual tabletop drill with local emergency responders. \n\n\n\n"
