      "SummaryText": "Aventine Renewable Energy produces ethanol from corn, and so the successful operation of its facilities depends on safely addressing the hazards of flammable liquids and explosive dusts.  From the receipt of grain, to its milling, fermentation, distillation, and shipping of product ethanol, the plant is acutely aware of the hazards it works with, and relies on the best practices to reduce the associated risks.  The plant?s compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard is a hallmark of these best practices.  While the plant is newly covered by the RMP Rule with the introduction to the process of anhydrous ammonia as a raw material, handling hazardous materials safely is not new.\n\nProcess and personnel safety are not just a priority of Aventine Renewable Energy, but an essential part of staying in business.  This includes the involvement of personnel throughout the organization and at all levels in process hazards analysis, training, and management of change, in order to prevent accidental release and to assure well coordinated emergency response.  In addition, plant personnel are quick to involve both the Fire Departments and the Planning Departments of the City of Pekin (and through these organizations, the Tazewell County LEPC) in significant modifications to plant, and are proud of the working relationships they have established. \n\nThe success of the spill prevention and risk reduction programs at the plant are born out by the simple statistic that there have been no accidental releases from the plant in the past five years. \n\nThe plant has maintained an ongoing program to identify and reduce risks, and to train all of it personnel in appropriate response.  The Pekin Fire Department is invited to make annual inspections, and these involve all shifts in the round-the-clock operation.  In 2002, the plant modified its process from azeotropic distillation to a considerably safer molecular sieve process.  This modification received the hearty endorsement "

However, the plant is committed to find a way to replace the anhydrous ammonia in the process with the much safer dilute aqueous ammonia as soon as is practical."
