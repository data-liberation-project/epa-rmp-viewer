EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  68.155\nThe Niceville, Valparaiso, Okaloosa County (NVOC) Regional Sewer Board, Inc.  operates a wastewater treatment facility in an mixed/residential industrial area in Niceville.  NVOC Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant at 507 Highway 85 North, Niceville, Okaloosa County, Florida.  The facilities EPA identification number is 1000 0006 0257 and the NAICS code for the site is 22132, sewage treatment facility.  The general commercial function of the facility is to treat raw wastewater and render acceptable discharge or reuse.  This plant is one of two plants operated by the City.  Both the water plant and waste water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  NVOC has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Wastewater Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nNVOC Regional Wastewater Treatment facility is operated by NVOC staff.  The facility has regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  NVOC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management program which applies to chlorination operation.  NVOC Treatment Facility operations and policies are presented in this Plan.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.    Management System  (a)(1)\nNVOC has a management system in place which is lead by the NVOC "

This program, along with other specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a chlorine release at the Facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the Facility RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.1.2.    Prevention Program Level (2)\nNVOC has implemented and maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of our prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the facility, OSHA PSM program.  RMP also requires the following elements as management system, hazards assessment off site, and RMP plan submittal needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in by NVOC?s Wastewater Treatment Facility Document Management System.\n1.2.    NVOC STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (B)\nNVOC Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant employs 12 full-time employees engaged in wastewater treatment facility and field operations.  NVOC also employs contractors and consultants for specialized  tasks.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n1.2.1.    Site Description  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by NVOC Regional Sewer Board.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 507 Highway 85 North, Niceville, Okaloosa County, Florida.  The site is located in a block area, boarded by Highway 85, North, on the west, an undeveloped commercial property on the north, the Egland Golf Course on the east and an undeveloped commercial property on the south.

These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.    Regulated Substance  (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  NVOC chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying wastewater for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to five process control systems.  \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT (C)\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public and environment.  For chlorine, the distance the endpoint concentration of the gas could travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of Chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and churches were identified.  \nThe offsite consequence analyses was conducted included two chemical release case scenarios.  The first is a ?worst case flammable release?.  The second is a worst case toxic release scenario?.  Both scenarios are defined by EPA, which states that ?the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released within 10 minutes? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative case scenario were based on plant experience and process hazards analysis.  the "

They are included in the Executive Summary as part of the facility records.\n1.3.2.    Alternative Case   (c)(2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA  water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 59.3 lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is excluded( * )  miles.

Facility Design\nThe plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and chlorine feed room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The building is equipped with ambient ventilation area.  The control room has a fan ventilation system\n1.4.2.3.    Equipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  The low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a chlorine monitor which detects the presence of chlorine in the storage and control building room.  The alarms and lights in the plant alert employees of a potential chlorine leak.  Plus, the alarm automatically turns on the vent fan for the room.\n1.5"

Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe emergency response program is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Niceville Fire Department which coordinates with Local Okaloosa County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Niceville Fire Department HazMat Team and with the Okaloosa County HazMat Team.  All are located in Okaloosa County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue,  management, and police departments in NVOC.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of NVOC Regional wastewater plant.\nThe procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators,  The primary response team include the Niceville Fire and Rescue, plus the Okaloosa County Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine ?B?
