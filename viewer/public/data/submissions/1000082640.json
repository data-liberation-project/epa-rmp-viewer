If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire Protection District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a finished product storage and shipping warehouse.  Finished product stored on site includes pesticide liquid and granular materials, and storage of aerosol pesticide finished products containing propellants.  Several types of propellants are used in the insecticide aerosol can products which include NP-70 (propane/n-butane) and Dimethyl Ether (DME).  NP-70 (propane/n-butane) is chosen as a representative sample since it has the worst-case impact.  The quantity in cans stored in the warehouse exceeds the 10,000 lbs propane/n-butane threshold.  The worst case scenario is based on a case of 12 aerosol cans exploding.  The RMP modeling was based upon a mixture: equal amounts of butane and propane.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propellant system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving the propellant system that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propellant system, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.
