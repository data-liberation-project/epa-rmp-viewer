This facility uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for wastewater disinfection and dechlorination.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are transported, stored and fed from one ton containers.  Harford County trains all operators in safe handling procedures, including Hazardous Materials Operations tailored to the chemicals and equipment used osnite.  Personal Protective Equipment requirements are trained and strictly enforced by all levels of management.  The County's aggressive training and strict adherence to established procedureshave resulted in this facility's  excellent safety record with no reportable incidents.
