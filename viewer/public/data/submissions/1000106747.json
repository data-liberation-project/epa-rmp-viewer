This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nCrestwood has a track lease agreement with Carolina Coastal Railway Inc. for the short-term storage of up to 50 propane railcars in Clinton, North Carolina.\n\nThe loaded interconnected railcars fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68 while disconnected from a means of transportation (i.e.locomotive). The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity: propane.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\nClinton Terminal Rail Tank Car Storage Site is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management Program 2 (RMP) regulation. \n\nSafety Information\n\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe storage of the regulated substance. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for safe storage of the propane and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained by operations. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). \n\nHazard Review\n\nCrestwood has conducted a Hazard Review of the Propane Tank Car Storage process to evaluate the hazards associated with the process. The review identified potential causes for accidental releases, safeguards needed to control hazards and preven"

Crestwood systematically examined each hazard identified in the review to ensure that adequate controls were in place and the potential risk was appropriately mitigated.\n\nRecommendations from Hazard Reviews are prioritized on a relative risk ranking based on Crestwood's Corporate Risk Matrix. The ranking helps ensure that potential hazards assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to Hazard Reviews are prioritized and tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nCrestwood conducts no operations at the site. Carolina Coastal Railway Inc. maintains written procedures that address deliveries and shipments for railroad tank cars. The procedures used onsite are written to comply with the Federal Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation regulations under 49 CFR Subtitle B Section II. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes.\n\nTraining\n\nCrestwood conducts no operations at the site. Carolina Coastal Railway Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all site employees. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations and must demonstrate competence. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nMaintenance\n\nCrestwood does not conduct any maintenance at the site. Carolina Coastal Railway Inc. has established practices and procedures to maintain the facility in safe operating conditions. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIf a release of a stationary propane tank car were to occur at Clinton Terminal Rail Tank Car Storage Site,  Carolina Coastal Railway Inc. would initiate the emergency response actions and conduct the incident investigation. Crestwood would not be involved in the emergency response actions or incident investigation or development of the incident report. Crestwood would have access to the incident report once the investigation is completed by the railroad.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nCarolina Coastal Railway Inc, Inc. follows the Federal Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation regulations under 49 CFR Subtitle B Section II for the movement and storage of tank cars including the tank cars stored by Crestwood at Clinton Terminal Rail Tank Car Storage Site. If a release of propane from a stationary tank car does occur, response actions would be directed by Carolina Coastal Railway Inc. Outside response activities, if deemed necessary,  would be coordinated with the ClintonFire Department and Sampson County Emergency Services.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Crestwood personnel, Clinton Terminal Rail Tank Car Storage Site has had no RMP accidents in the last five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCrestwood has completed a Hazard Review for the process and has developed an action plan for the findings associated with the triennial compliance audits."
