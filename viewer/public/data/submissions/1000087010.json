      "SummaryText": "The water treatment plant is located south of SH 334 in Gun Barrel City, Henderson County, Texas.  Facilities are in place to store several one-ton cylinders of chlorine for treatment of water.  Drinking water produced by the Brookshire Water Treatment Plant supplies the public in the East Cedar Creek Lake/Gun Barrel City area.  Chlorine is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The properties of chlorine which make the substance useful in the treatment of water necessitate safety precautions for prevention of unnecessary exposure.  Such precautions reduce the threat of injury to plant employees and surrounding populations.  Training of new employees should include the hazards of handling and using chlorine as outlined in Section 8, Prevention Program 2.  Emphasis of the training should be on prevention of accidents and injury associated with the storage and use of chlorine.  There have been no plant accidents in the preceding 5-year period.  The Accidental release Prevention Program is in effect and copies of the RMP Manual are available at the plant.  Emergency Response Policies have been in effect and are not being revised as a part of the RMP.\n\n"
