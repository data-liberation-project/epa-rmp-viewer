All operators are mandated to complete chlorine and sulfur dioxide emergency response training within the first year on the job. Refresher courses are offered both locally and through the local member association of the Water Environment Federation as well as state training offices in both Idaho and Washington. Safety reviews are conducted locally several times per year. Emergency equipment is well maintained and regularly exercised.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe city's AWTP is located on the Spokane River about 0.5 miles downstream of the outlet of Coeur d'Alene Lake. It is located adjacent to a stud sawmill and to the city-owned Harbor Center office building.\n\nThe AWTP currently treats a summer peak wastewater flow of 3.2 million gallons per day (mgd) and is designed for 6.0 mgd. It currently serves a municipal population of approximately 31,000. It utilizes the following liquid stream processes:\n\n\tScreening, pre-aeration and grit removal.\n\tPrimary clarification.\n\tPlastic media trickling filters for secondary treatment in conjunction with solids \tre-aeration and solids contact for secondary treatment.\n\tSecondary clarification.\n\tChlorine solution disinfection followed by sulfur dioxide solution neutralization \tof the excess chlorine.\n\tLiquid alum addition i"

Up to 8,000 pounds of chlorine and 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide can be on-site in storage at any one time. The City of Coeur d'Alene's Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWTP) is staffed 8 hours per day and 7 days per week. One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine (under pressure) furnish the necessary gas for mixing with water as a disinfectant to the AWTP's effluent. Just prior to the effluent's discharge to the Spokane River, a solution of water and sulfur dioxide is added to neutralize the excess chlorine. Sulfur dioxide is stored likewise in one-ton cylinders for dispensing.\n\nTwo operators are always present during the transfer of cylinders to and from storage.\n\nThe storage and dispensing areas are in a sealed building of masonry construction. The storage areas are treated as confined space entry areas. Advance entry permits are required before entry.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nWorst-Case:\n\nEither a one-ton cylinder of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is ruptured while being moved into the storage building effecting a release. For chlorine it is assumed that the release rate is 200 pounds per minute for a duration of 10 minutes. For sulfur dioxide it is assumed that the release rate is 200 pounds per minute for a duration of 10 minutes. As this is an urban area, the end-point concentration of 3 parts per million (ppm) extends for a radius of 1.3 miles and has the potential of affecting 11,100 residents.

It has the capacity to neutralize 2350 pounds of either chemical. Upon alarm activation (At 5 ppm), the unit automatically starts. It places the storage facility under negative pressure and passes the vapors into the scrubber system. Liquid fractions are collected in a trench and are vacuumed into the liquid eductor of the scrubber. Neutralized gases are vented to the atmosphere.\n\nThe scrubber has 2 feed pumps that draw the vacuum. One is needed; the other is redundant back-up. The unit is connected to the plant's standby generator so that it is fully functional in the event of a power outage.\n\nThe maximum chlorine discharge limit is 15 ppm; or 50% of the IDHL. At 500 cfm this computes to a release rate of 0.613 GRAMS per minute. It takes 25.5 minutes to neutralize the entire contents from a one-ton cylinder.\n\nThe maximum sulfur dioxide discharge limit is 50 ppm; or 50% of the IDHL. At 500 cfm this computes to a release rate of 1.84 GRAMS per minute. It takes 25.5 minutes to neutralize the entire contents from a one-ton cylinder.\n\nThe default end-point distance is 0.1 miles. No residential population is potentially affected by such a release.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors are present in each storage area. They are actuated at 5 ppm concentrations. Audio and visual alarms are activated throughout the plant and at the city's fire department. Fire department response time is less than 5 minutes. Both the plant and collection system on-call operators are automatically called and paged.\n\nSCBA equipment is located on-site. Five units are located around the plant site.
