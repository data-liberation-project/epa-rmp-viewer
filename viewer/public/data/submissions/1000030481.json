Policy dictates that\n\nRinchem personnel continuously identify methods to reduce the risk of handling hazardous materials and to\n\nreduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and\n\nprocedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team\n\nMember Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees. The Safety and Health\n\npolicy states:\n\nSAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life. Rinchem Company, Inc., is committed to\n\nproviding a safe working environment for its staff members, its customers and the public, and maintains that\n\n\"NO JOB IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS, OUR\n\nCOMMUNITIES, AND THE ENVIRONMENT\".\n\nWe recognize that the responsibilities for safety and health are shared:\n\nManagement, in particular the Director of Quality, ES&H, accepts the responsibility for leadership of the\n\nsafety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required\n\nto ensure safe conditions.\n\nManagers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring processes are documented which reinforce safety as\n\nwell as the use of engineering controls as the preferred method of promoting safety and eliminating unsafe\n\nconditions.\n\nStaff members are responsible for cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program including\n\ncompliance with all rules, documented procedures, and regulations and for continuously practicing safety\n\nwhile performing their duties.\n\nStaff members are responsible for stopping activities that may lead to injuries to themse"

Description of the Savannah, GA Facility\n\nThe Savannah, GA facility is located at 5565 Export Blvd., Garden City, GA 31408. The facility provides\n\ntransportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged\n\nspecialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as\n\nspecified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Savannah, GA Warehouse include\n\nchemicals containing toxic hazards. Hydrochloric Acid 37% & Epichlorohydrin are the only RMP regulated substances handled at the site.\n\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\n\nRinchem receives Hydrochloric Acid 37% & Epichlorohydrin by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system.\n\nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships the (2) above listed chemicals as ordered by the end user.

Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential\n\nhazards at the Rinchem Savannah, GA Warehouse. Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis,\n\nusing the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA),RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules\n\nspecified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our\n\nwarehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Savannah, GA warehouse is a\n\ncatastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Hydrochloric Acid 37% and 55 gallons of Epichlorohydrin (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the two chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building.\n\n1.4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological\n\nsafeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those\n\nrecommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve\n\nSafety\". The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that\n\nprevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.\n\n1.5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Hydrochloric Acid 37% & Epichlorohydrin or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Savannah, GA Warehouse.\n\n1.6.
