Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 13 states.  Fifteen processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients, and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Perry Processing Plant is a poultry-processing plant located at 250 Highway 247 Spur in Perry, Georgia.  The facility is a poultry processing plant that employes approximately 1798 associates.  The facility normally operates 24 hours a day, five days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Perry facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system consisits of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping, and air handling units located throughout the facility, in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is approximately 95,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPOINSE POLICIES:\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.

The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of  Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmenatl, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe Perdue Farms Perry facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance as needed.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere has been one accident involving anhydrous ammonia during the last five years, which resulted in property no damage to the facility other than to repair a ruptured rechiller tube which caused the event. The event resulted in no injury, illness, or other damage to the Perry facility or the surrounding community.  A plant evacuation was conducted, and all associates were accounted for immediately.  The release was contained and confined by the facility emergency response team (Refrigeration Associates) ,without outside responder assistance, following safe response practices.  Notifications were made to the National Response Center, the State Emergency Coordinator, and the Georgia Environmental Protection Department in the appropriate time required.  It was determined that a 298 pound release had occurre"

The facility has a trained emergency response team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire, or other emergency situation.  The written Emergency Respnse Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedure, as well as inciden notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, Perdue conducts an evacuation at least once a year.  \n\nAs part of our Risk Management Plan (RMP), Perdue Farms has developed a RMP Communications Plan.  The goals of the plan are to:\n\n1> Educate the public on the potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue\n\n2> Respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest fact-based communications\n\n3> Be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental release scenario\n\nProactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, how the community should respond, and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared.  In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civil groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Perry facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality."
