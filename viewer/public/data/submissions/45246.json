The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of  Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmenatl, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe Perdue Farms Perry facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance as needed.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere has been one accident involving anhydrous ammonia during the last five years, which resulted in property no damage to the facility other than to repair a ruptured rechiller tube which caused the event. The event resulted in no injury, illness, or other damage to the Perry facility or the surrounding community.  A plant evacuation was conducted, and all associates were accounted for immediately.  The release was contained and confined by the facility emergency response team (Refrigeration Associates) ,without outside responder assistance, following safe response practices.  Notifications were made to the National Response Center, the State Emergency Coordinator, and the Georgia Environmental Protection Department in the appropriate time required.

An Executive Safety Review was convened where incident cause and a corrective action was developed {Water pump  for rechiller was changed to key access operation switch to limit operation by knowledgeable personnel}.  The equipment was repaired as well as inspected by the manufacturer to ensure mechanical integrity prior to return to service.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe Perdue Farms facility has implemented a comprehensive Emergency respnse Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.  The facility has a trained emergency response team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire, or other emergency situation.  The written Emergency Respnse Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedure, as well as inciden notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, Perdue conducts an evacuation at least once a year.  \n\nAs part of our Risk Management Plan (RMP), Perdue Farms has developed a RMP Communications Plan.  The goals of the plan are to:\n\n1> Educate the public on the potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue\n\n2> Respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest fact-based communications\n\n3> Be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental release scenario\n\nProactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, how the community should respond, and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared.  In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civil groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Perry facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality."
