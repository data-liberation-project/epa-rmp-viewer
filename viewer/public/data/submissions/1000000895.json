As a part of this commitment, CCC has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the Charles City Plant. One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage risks at the Charles City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at the Charles City Plant.

We store approximately 43,000 lbs. of allylamine, a toxic and flammable substance, in a 7,500 gal. bulk storage tank at atmospheric pressure.  The bulk storage tank and associated process equipment has a maximum intended inventory of 65,000 lbs and is regulated as a single EPA RMP Program 3 process.\n\n1.3  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCCC maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and to ensure safe operation:\n\nProcess Safety Information - CCC maintains up-to-date, easily accessible versions of a variety of important chemical process information concerning chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment so that our employees can effectively perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - CCC performs te"
