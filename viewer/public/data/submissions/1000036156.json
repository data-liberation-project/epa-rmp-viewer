These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).\r\nUnited Pacific Energy also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nUnited Pacific Energy primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of United Pacific Energy staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

United Pacific Energy Products Operating conducted a safety and environmental assessment to review compliance of the entire facility with all applicable regulations in January of\r\n2008.

An external events analysis was also conducted as part of the January, 2008 safety assessment.\r\nAs part of United Pacific Energy Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Bakersfield Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.

Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\nTraining\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Bakersfield Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\r\nContractors\r\nThe Bakersfield Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, United Pacific Energy evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Bakersfield Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Bakersfield Terminal has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Bakersfield Terminal uses United Pacific Energy paper system for change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Bakersfield Terminal is coordinated with Kern County Environmental Health Services.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with a member of the health service staff, and coordination of emergency response with Kern County Environmental Health Services, local government officials and emergency responders. The Bakersfield Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\nPlanned Changes t"
