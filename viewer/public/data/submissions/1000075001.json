Chlorine used in the chlorination of drinking water is stored at this location.  A maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine are stored in one ton cylinders.  The City of Alexandria Hwy 28 West Site is included in written community emergency response plan.  In case of a chlorine leak, the City of Alexandria has an emergency response policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 center as well as local fire and police departments.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evacuating the citizens in the affected area.  Currently, the City uses daily inspection, leak detection and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  Plant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.  On-going operator training and preventative maintenance continue to be key tools to ensure the safety of the public.\r\n\r\nThe City of Alexandria Highway 28 West Site had one accident involving Chlorine on 7/20/2016 which resulted in injuries to two employees.  There were no off-site impacts.  The following corrective actions were taken to prevent the recurrence of such accidents:  i) Revised the training program; ii) Revised the operating procedures; and 3) Revised the emergency response plan.\r\n     \r\nThe following provides a description of the risk management program at the City of Alexandria Water department Highway 28 West Site. \r\n\r\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Alexandria Water Department Highway 28 West Site is committed to the safety of"
