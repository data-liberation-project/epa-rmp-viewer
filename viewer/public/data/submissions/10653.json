Safety is a primary responsibility of all levels of management and supervision and they are expected to set an example by their behavior.\n\nBayer is committed to the safe operation of its facilities and will design, operate, maintain, and regularly inspect facilities to safeguard employees and the public.  Bayer's goal is to make its operations safer by continuos improvements in safety and health measures.\n\n\"Responsible Care\" is a public commitment to which the Bayer Baytown Plant pledges wholehearted support.  This initiative of our company, and other members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, is designed to continuously improve the health, safety and environmental performance of all companies.\n\nThe Bayer Baytown Plant is a Star rated facility in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Programs.\n\nWe will strive for Safety, Health, and Environmental excellence while supporting our customer's, corporate, and site objectives.\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nThe Bayer Baytown facility is located two miles east of the city of Baytown and five miles south of the city of Mont Belview, Texas.  It is situated in a former rice field.  The facility is centered on approximately 1200 acres of which approximately 50% have been built.\n\nThe Bayer-Baytown facility is primarily a manufacturing site.  Services and support are on site to support the manufacturing needs.  The facility is comprised of several different manufacturing divisions within the Bayer Corporation.  \n\nAll manufacturing processes are located on contiguous property and are managed by the same corporate organization.  The Bayer Baytown site is considered a stationary source.\n\nThe site is serviced by highw"

The entire site has been defined as a Process Safety Management site by the Bayer Baytown management.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level.  For the scope of Risk Management, all covered processes are considered to be Program Level III processes.\n\nThere are ten covered chemicals which are in use at quantities greater than the threshold quantity defined in the RMP regulations.  These ten chemicals are:\n* Ammonia\n* Ammonia solution (greater than 20%)\n* Butane\n* Chlorine\n* Ethylene oxide\n* Formaldehyde solution (37%)\n* Hydrazine (only exists as an intermediate step in one process)\n* Phosgene\n* Propylene oxide\n* Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomer form).\nThere are several other chemicals in use in the Baytown Plant which are covered (anhydrous hydrogen chloride and hydrogen), but exist in quantities significantly below the threshold quantities.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Baytown plant used the EPA supplied consequence analysis guidance documents to assess the offsite impacts of the scenarios evaluated.  The scenarios selected are adequately covered by these documents.\n\nThe Worst case Scenario for toxics involve the release of a toxic material from the largest vessel in the process.

The distance to the EPA specified end-point would be off site a small distance.\n\nThe EPA guidelines specify that an alternate release scenario must be developed for each toxic material and one for all flammable materials.  These alternate release scenario must have an off site consequence unless one does not exist and must be useful for emergency planning by the local emergency responders.  \n\nEach covered toxic material was assessed to identify a release scenario which does provide an off-site consequences regardless of the numerous safety systems in place to prevent any release from leaving this plant area.

To adequately control the hazards presented in each process:\n\n* Employee Participation\nEmployees are provided opportunities to participate on numerous safety steering committees which affect the worklife of each area at the Bayer Baytown site.  Participation in these organizations is encouraged. All identified action items from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to personnel for review.  Involvement of personnel in the OSHA-VPP program has been exceptional.

Access is provided to chemical specific information (MSDS), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process.  The information resides in an electronic system which is updated regularly.  All PSI is verified at each scheduled PHA.\n\n* Process Hazards Analysis\nProcess hazards analyses are conducted in each process on a five-year basis.  The HazOp method is used to conduct the PHA.  Findings are identified, prioritized and corrected in a timely manner.
