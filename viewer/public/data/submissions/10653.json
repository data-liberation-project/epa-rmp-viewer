Products are used in the production:\n* of coatings and paint products (polyurethane coatings), \n* of flexible foams (seat padding), semi-rigid foams (automobile fascia, athletic shoe soles), and rigid foams (insulation sheets),\n* of thermal plastics (compact disks - CDs),\n* of intermediates to be used in manufacturing herbicides and pesticides, and\n* organic intermediates used in the manufacture of resins and plastics  (boats).\n\nThe Baytown plant has ten covered RMP processes.  The entire site has been defined as a Process Safety Management site by the Bayer Baytown management.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level.  For the scope of Risk Management, all covered processes are considered to be Program Level III processes.\n\nThere are ten covered chemicals which are in use at quantities greater than the threshold quantity defined in the RMP regulations.  These ten chemicals are:\n* Ammonia\n* Ammonia solution (greater than 20%)\n* Butane\n* Chlorine\n* Ethylene oxide\n* Formaldehyde solution (37%)\n* Hydrazine (only exists as an intermediate step in one process)\n* Phosgene\n* Propylene oxide\n* Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomer form).\nThere are several other chemicals in use in the Baytown Plant which are covered (anhydrous hydrogen chloride and hydrogen), but exist in quantities significantly below the threshold quantities.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Baytown plant used the EPA supplied consequence analysis guidance documents to assess the offsite impacts of the scenarios evaluated.  The scenarios selected are adequately covered by these documents.\n\nThe Worst case Scenario for toxics involve the release of a toxic material from the largest vessel in the process.  The release, by EPA definition, can not have any mitigation systems operate and no operator is allowed to intervene.  The release is assumed to occur and a"

The worst case, under these definitions, is a release of a full tank of chlorine which would have an off site consequence.\n\nThe worst case for flammable materials is similar.  The release considers the largest vessel is completely full.  All the contents are released instantly, vaporized instantly, and detonated instantly.  The distance to a one-psi over-pressure is considered the worst case distance.\n\nAlthough there are numerous safeguards to prevent such an incident, the worst case scenario at Bayer Baytown would be the release and detonation of a full tank of butane.  The distance to the EPA specified end-point would be off site a small distance.\n\nThe EPA guidelines specify that an alternate release scenario must be developed for each toxic material and one for all flammable materials.  These alternate release scenario must have an off site consequence unless one does not exist and must be useful for emergency planning by the local emergency responders.  \n\nEach covered toxic material was assessed to identify a release scenario which does provide an off-site consequences regardless of the numerous safety systems in place to prevent any release from leaving this plant area.  The alternate release scenarios for toxics at the Bayer plant include:\n* Ammonia: a leak in a plant pipe system\n* Ammonia solution: a leak in a plant pipe system\n* Chlorine: a leak in a plant pipe system\n* Ethylene oxide: a leak in an unloading system pipe\n* Formaldehyde: a leak in a plant pipe system\n* Hydrazine: a leak in the pipe system (at a specific process step)\n* Phosgene: a leak in a plant pipe system\n* Propylene oxide: a leak in an unloading system pipe\n* Toluene diisocyanate: a leak in a vessel.\nThe leak sizes and duration of each of these was adjusted until an off site consequence was reached.\n\nEach covered flammable material was analyzed to develop a release scenario which does provide an off-site consequences regardle"

The alternate release scenarios for toxics at the Bayer plant include:\n* Butane: a leak in a vessel (leading to a vapor cloud fire).\nThe leak sizes and duration of each of these was adjusted until an off site consequence was reached.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe Bayer Baytown plant has defined each of the processes as covered by Process Safety Management.  To adequately control the hazards presented in each process:\n\n* Employee Participation\nEmployees are provided opportunities to participate on numerous safety steering committees which affect the worklife of each area at the Bayer Baytown site.  Participation in these organizations is encouraged. All identified action items from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to personnel for review.  Involvement of personnel in the OSHA-VPP program has been exceptional.  Personnel particpate in all PSM-releated activities .\n\n* Process Safety Information\nAll Bayer personnel on this site have access to the electronic mail system and company Intranet.  Access is provided to chemical specific information (MSDS), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process.  The information resides in an electronic system which is updated regularly.  All PSI is verified at each scheduled PHA.\n\n* Process Hazards Analysis\nProcess hazards analyses are conducted in each process on a five-year basis.  The HazOp method is used to conduct the PHA.  Findings are identified, prioritized and corrected in a timely manner.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\nOperating Procedures\nOperating procedure which address all of the normal and non-normal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure "

Training is documented through a network system.  The system allows determination of training needs as well as completion of required training subjects. \n\nContractor Safety\nControl of contractors in the operating areas has been established.  A safety steering committee and safety council has been put in place to continually monitor the actions of contractors to assure their safety as well as the safety of the Bayer plant.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system is put into operation.  Any findings are addressed prior to the startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMechanical integrity procedures are in place to assure that maintenance workers understand how to safely perform the duties required to maintain the facility.  Specific instructions for testing and inspections are included.  Testing and inspections are conducted as scheduled and documented.  Maintenance and engineering follows established codes, standards, and company guidelines.\n\nHot Work and Control of Abnormal Activities\nControl of hot work and abnormal situations is conducted to assure that work in the workplace does not contribute or cause hazardous results.  All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.\n\nManagement of Change\nChange is managed properly.  All changes generate an appropriate assessment of possible impacts on the level of safety and health on an area.  All necessary documents and procedures are changed.  Personnel are informed regarding the change before they are required to operate the new system.\n\nIncident Investigations\nIncidents, accidents, and near miss situations are investigated.
