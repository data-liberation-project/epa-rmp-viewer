      "SummaryText": "This Executive Summary is to inform all interested persons, including employees that the Pilgrim's Pride - Canton, GA Poultry Processing Facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP) Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\r\n\r\nThese programs help this facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. This facility has three refrigeration systems using Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant. The amount of Anhydrous Ammonia contained in two of these, DeBone and Evis Department Ammonia Refrigeration, systems is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RMP standards.  Since none of the systems are connected, two separate processes are being submitted.\r\n\r\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment. Safety is ensured through careful preventative measures and emergency planning. The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release. This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Our safety programs help to prevent accidents because they focus on rul"

      "SummaryText": "es, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120). This program includes an emergency response notification plan, emergency response drills and drill evaluations. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the local Fire Department and ensures that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced a recordable Ammonia release in the past five years.\r\n\r\nThis facility is in the process of implementing Ammonia Process Safety Management Inc. (APSM), a powerful online tool to enable\r\ncomprehensive and company-wide standardization of PSM and RMP compliance related elements. Pilgrim's Pride and this facility\r\nwill use this system to manage its compliance programs in an easily accessible online format that is also consistent, efficient, and\r\nprovides effective control from the top down to enhance collaboration, efficiency, reporting and accuracy."
