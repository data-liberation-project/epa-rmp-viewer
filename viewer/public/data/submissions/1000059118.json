The sample system provides at least every 15 minute interval monitoring in each room. Each detector sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, a standalone detector is installed inside the hallway that provides continuous monitoring. The hallway detector is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed on the south exterior wall of the cold storage (near the machinery area), which contains three valves.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following: (5) Rooms (4) Precools (1) Electrical Room.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\n\r\nMost control valve groups are located in the hallway (catwalk) to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery area. \r\n\r\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established"
