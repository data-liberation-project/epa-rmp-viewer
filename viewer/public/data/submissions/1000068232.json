The plant site consists of a main\r\nprocessing plant, raw potato storage buildings, general maintenance facility, boiler/refrigeration\r\nfacility, primary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage.  The covered process at the \r\nfacility is a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system \r\nallows the finished products to be quickly cooled and frozen.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe OSHA PSM component elements are organized as follows: 1) Employees participate in the\r\nelements of this safety and release prevention program whenever possible; 2) Ammonia awareness\r\nand PSM training is provided to all employees, operators and maintenance personnel receive\r\nadditional training; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on the covered processes; 4)\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the covered processes were conducted and will be periodically\r\nreviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical Integrity program ensures the covered\r\nprocesses will continue to operate as designed; 6) Operating and Maintenance procedures provide\r\noperators and maintenance staff the information necessary to safely operate and maintain the\r\ncovered processes; 7) Contractors working on or near the system are selected through a rigorous\r\nreview of their safety performance and relevant experience, and are briefed on"
