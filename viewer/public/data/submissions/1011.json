This type of analysis applies to and is required for every hazardous (toxic & reactive) chemical listed in section 1910.119.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) shall include, but is not limited to the following items:\n\n1.The hazards of each process; both chemical and mechanical hazards should be noted.\n\n2.Identification/examples of previous incidents which did, or could have become, catastrophic.\n\n3.The used or site available chemical detection methods.\n\n4.Consequences of loss of system/process control.

Typically, each of the acceptable methods will require up-to-date process flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation drawings, and data regarding process materials and conditions.  Certain hazard analysis techniques may require additional, more detailed materials.\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted with the clear goal of identifying potential hazards.  Recommendations may be made with the intent of reducing or eliminating a potential hazard .  Items of concern also may be identified for further, more detailed study.\n\nThe follow-up phase involves evaluating the proposed recommendations to determine the appropriate course of action. the action taken may include:\n\n 1.      Accepting and implementing the recommendations as made;\n\n 2.      Accepting  the recommendations in principle but developing an alternative approach to meet the intent; or                                                                                                                                                              1.

The current situation may be the course of action taken if there appears to be no technically feasible solution for the situation identified, if any recommendation considered would pose additional, more serious hazards, or if it is determined that the reduction in risk is not significant enough to justify implementing any recommendation.  Implementing engineering and/or administrative controls may be used to reduce the risk of hazard.\n\nFurther study may be required to determine if certain hazards identified are indeed significant to exposed workplace employees.  This further study initially may require a more detailed hazard analysis, possibly with a different technique from the group of approved methods, followed by a consequence analysis that will more precisely evaluate the consequences of the potential hazards.RMP Executive Summary \nBurris Refrigerated Logistics, \nSumter, South Carolina\n\n\n                                                                  \n\n\n\n                                                      Regulated Substance Handled\n\n     Burris Refrigerated Logistics (Sumter, S.C.) located 1900 corporateway Rd. Is a public cold storage / frozen food facility. The prime Refrigerant used is Anhydrous Ammonia in a closely controlled and monitored environment. The Refrigeration system is Computer controlled with built in safeguards which is monitored 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year. The facility has personal \"on call\" at all times that are trained and qualified to handle any emergency situation that may arise. The system is monitored in each Room that the process takes place by a computer linked detection system. The machine room, where the compressors and vessels are located has an automatic venting system that incorporates a water curtain should an incident occur.\n     Ammonia is a self-alarming substance with a distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (the"

Ammonia will burn however, but only in a very narrow and high range of concentration with high temperature. \n     The U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) has made a determination on the permissible exposure of ammonia to people. The maximum allowable exposure for eight hours is 50 PPM (parts per million). \n\n\nWorst case Scenario\n\n     The worst case scenario of ammonia spill at the Sumter, S.C. facility was chosen to be a vessel rupture. We have conducted our own modeling as guidance for this report. The RMP Ammonia Program Plan document was closely followed to ensure compliance.\n     As a result we have found that should a catastrophic incident occur. There would be very limited private residences in the areas of release.\nThe businesses that would be effected in the immediate area are on a \"call list\" and would be contacted by a designated person if an emergency would occur during normal business hours. The worst case release of Anhydrous Ammonia would come from a rupture of the high pressure vessel that is located in the machine room. The amount of the release in the study was 5,000 pounds. The release rate is 100 pounds of ammonia in a fifty-minute period. With a 1.5 MPH wind. The distance to the end point equals .3 miles. There are no Schools, Hospitals, Prisons, or Recreation areas within the scope of this model. There are however, Office and industrial Buildings in the effected area.
