Danisco operates a food additive manufacturing and processing facility in New Century, Kansas.  The New Century facility distills monoglycerides for use in food products.  On site, Danisco has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of various food products made at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00c2\u00a768.130.\n\nSince the quantity of ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Danisco is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the New Century facility which includes three (3) major elements:  hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Danisco.  The required RMP information was originally submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) before the deadline of June 21, 1999, and was resubmitted on or around June 21, 2004 and June 21, 2009.\n\nDanisco is also subject to OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this report, Danisco is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDanisco attaches importance to creating and sustaining long-term environmental solutions based on a general environmental policy:\n\u00c2\u00bf Danisco respects the fact that development, production, and trade influence the environment.\n\u00c2\u00bf Danisco invests in developing environmentally friendly products and processes by using cleaner technology.\n\u00c2\u00bf Danisco will, by making regular technical improvements and providing training"

Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the safety and health of the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.\n\n1.2\tDescription of Danisco and the Regulated Substance Handled\nDanisco operates a food ingredient manufacturing and processing facility in New Century, Kansas.  The New Century facility produces distilled monoglycerides for use in food products.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary cooling for the processing of the product.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself. \n\n1.3\tWorst Case Scenario\nSection \u00c2\u00a768.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. \n\nAt Danisco, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest vessel containing ammonia.  The largest tank (2,950 lbs) is assumed to instantaneously release the entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The ammonia will release into an enclosed building and will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs dispersion modeling software RMP*Comp and shows that the toxic endpoint will reach an impact distance of 0.7 miles. This release would affect residential populations and industrial areas. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a \u00c2\u00bc\u00c2\u00bf hole in the process piping.  This failure will conservatively assume that 5,400 pounds of ammonia will release for one hour from"

As stated in Section 1.6 of this document, Danisco is a non-responding facility and would be required to call in the appropriate personnel to respond to the release.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs dispersion modeling software RMP*Comp and shows that the toxic endpoint will reach an impact radius of 0.3 miles.  This release would also affect industrial areas.  \n\n1.4\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDanisco has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. Danisco has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, alarms, and ammonia detectors located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n1.5\tFive year Accident History\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia as outlined in \u00c2\u00a768.42 of the RMP Regulations.  \n\n1.6\tThe Emergency Response Program\nDanisco maintains a written Emergency Plan to help assure timely, safe, compliant responses in the event of an emergency.  Danisco is classified as a non responding facility as listed in the Emergency Response Plan.  Danisco will ensure the safety of the employees and notify the appropriate responders in the event of a release.  Danisco is coordinated with the local fire department and with the Johnson County LEPC. \n\n1.7\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nDanisco makes safety a first priority in its every day operations to ensure a safe working environment for all of its employees.  Danisco is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.  \n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently reviewed at the Danisco facility.
