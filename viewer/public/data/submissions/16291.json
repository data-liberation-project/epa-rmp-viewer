      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Evans Houston\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Evans Houston are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Evans Houston facility's primary activities are repackaging and warehousing of chemicals. Evans either repackages or warehouses up to a maximum of 11 regulated substances at our facility.  These substances are listed below.  Evans receives the regulated substances in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time.  \n\nChemical                                                                CAS No.\nToxic Substances:\nAcrylonitrile                                                           107-13-1\nAllyl Alcohol                                                          107-18-6\nCyclohexylamine                                                   108-91-8\nEthylenediamine                                                    107-15-3\nFormaldehyde (37%)                                              50-00-0\nToluene 2,4 diisocyanate                                      584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 diisocyanate                                        91-08-7\nToluene diisocyanate                                         26471-62-5\n\n\nFlammable Substances (Liquid Form):\n"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nEvans is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Evans is a Program 3 level facility because the processes covered under RMP are also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, Evans used EPA's program RMP*Comp to calculate the off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nScenarios for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Acrylonitrile.  The scenario involves the release of 40,557 lb. of Acrylonitrile in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  The release is completely contained within a diked area.  Evaporation from that pool within the dike occurs over 60 minutes.  Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/l.\n\nOne alternative release scenario is submitted for each toxic substance that may be present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrylonitril"

The checklist method is used to carry out our process hazard analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis or when there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Evans maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEvans has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work.  Refresher training is provided on a regular basis and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEvans carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as needed at Evans.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEvans will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEvans promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEvans believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Five-year Accident History\nEvans has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years so that no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\nEvans has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident return to wok procedure\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.
