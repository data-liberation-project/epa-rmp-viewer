This document has been prepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\r\n\r\n\tFederal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements (RMP).\r\n\r\n-\tOSHA's Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Section 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this document is to:\r\n\r\n-\tIncrease the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\r\n\r\n-\tAssist Costco Wholesale and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThis document addresses Costco Wholesale's administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks.  The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. The facility utilizes an ammonia system to provide refrigeration for for cold storage and dock operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintainin"

Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Depot Manager, with assistance from Costco corporate and other personnel at the facility.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale- Van Buren is located at 5860 Belleville Rd., in Van Buren Charter Township, MI.  The facility is located approximately 0.58 miles south of U.S. State Highway 12 and approximately 3.00 miles north of the M-94 Interstate. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial and residential areas.  The facility began operations in November 2015.  \r\n\r\nThe primary business of Costco Wholesale is to provide cooling and storage of perishable food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 18,022 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock operations.  Typical operating conditions range from 35 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \r\n\r\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code ap"

      "SummaryText": "plicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that relieve into a common header that vents to an ammonia diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following: \r\n\r\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. \r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following: \r\n\r\n-\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or \r\n-\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\" \r\n\r\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted on February 2022, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (October 2018 - February 2022)\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives.\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe facility"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and put the facility's action plan into play to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, conducted on October 9, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Costco Wholesale facility.  The Costco Wholesale safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
