The facility processes primarily Cod, Pollock, Salmon, crab, Halibut and other species of Alaskan Seafood.    Anhydrous ammonia in excess of the thresh hold limit of 10,000 pounds is used to freeze and store product and is subject the Process Safety Management (PSM) program developed by OSHA and the Risk Management Program (RMP) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to operate and maintain their refrigeration system.  The RMP is submitted to the EPA to meet the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified in the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Title 40 Part 68.\n\nThere is a management system that designates the responsibility of each section of the RMP to a specific person.  Most sections of the Risk Management Plan are reviewed yearly, revised and updated.  Every five years a process hazard analysis is completed or revalidated for the entire system.  A written follow up report is generated, and recommendations documented.  Every three years a compliance audit is performed, and program components are reviewed in order to examine and improve our program. Document management for the PSM program is done through SharePoint and allows for enhanced employee participation and communication.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia system uses 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in cold storage, chillers, a brine freezer, blast freezers, plate freezers and in the operation of ice making machines.  A worse case and alternate worst case scenario have been studied and details the effects of an ammonia release.  This modeling is shared with employees and is useful in communicating what the potential effects would be for alternate and worse case scenarios.\n\nThe prevention program, complying with 29 CFR 1910.119, fosters employ"

Knowledge of the program begins with an understanding of the components and equipment.  This collected data is compiled and presented in the Process Safety information section.   Standard operating procedures both detail and instruct process operation and maintenance procedures.  Any changes are documented to insure any modification is correctly designed, and properly installed by qualified contractors and maintenance persons.  Possible hazards and safety recommendations are reviewed and considered.  Hot work permits are used to insure safe operation where welding, cutting, or hot work is performed.  The mechanical integrity of the system is methodically inspected and tested for operation to insure safe operation.  The operation of the plant prevention program follows guidelines and standards set forth by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, ANSI/IIAR-2, ASHRAE Standard 15, and ASME B-31 as well as recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nFive Year Accident History (40 CFR 68.42)\n\nThere has been one reportable accident involving ammonia at the Trident Seafoods Corp. Sandpoint, Alaska facility during the last five years. This incident occurred on 8/26/2016 when 2 employees needed treatment for an incident involving a plate freezer. Release amount was estimated to be approximately 39 pounds. \n\n \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nTrident Seafoods Sand Point, Alaska has a written Emergency Response Plan.  Annual HAZWOPER refresher training is conducted for responders.  Emergency evacuation and response training drills are held periodically during the year to acquaint seasonal employees with emergency response procedures and to practice the emergency response team.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTrident Seafoods is constantly improving its Safety program.
