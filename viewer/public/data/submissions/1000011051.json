      "SummaryText": "The Air Liquide Industrial US LP (A?Air LiquideA?) Wilmington, CA CO2 plant (Wilmington CO2 Plant) produces liquid carbon dioxide used in the carbonation of beverages, food processing, pH control, fire protection and other applications.  The Wilmington CO2 Plant is located within the confines of the Wilmington Conoco Phillips (CP) Refinery complex.  Conoco Phillips is the host provider of the CO2 raw gas process feedstock.   Anhydrous ammonia is the RMP-regulated substance at the facility. The ammonia is used in the process as a refrigerant to cool and liquefy the carbon dioxide.  The plant has six full-time employees\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a hazardous chemical and subject to federal and state laws.   Air Liquide Industrial has established policy and procedures to manage the industrial system and process that contains the ammonia in accordance with applicable regulations in particular OSHAA?s PSM (26CFR1910.119) and EPAA?s RMP (40CFR68) regulations.  \n\nThe Wilmington CO2 Plant risk management program (Risk Management Plan) contains the technical and process information required to safely maintain and operate the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and minimizes the risk of an accidental release of ammonia to the environment.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operational limits for key process parameters. The risk management program encourages the employees to participate in the process safety management and accident prevention through ongoing training and communication on all key elements such as Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change (MOC), Pre-Startup Safety Review, and Incident Reporting and Investigation.\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the Wilmington CO2 Plant anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system was performed in 1994 and the most recent revalidation was completed in 2005.   The results of the PHA serve as the basis to improv"

      "SummaryText": "e the Risk Management Plan.  Inspections and audits are also an integral part of Air Liquide Process Safety Management procedure and corporate safety oversight and compliance program. The Wilmington CO2 Plant is subject to inspections and audits by the Air Liquide Health, Safety and Environmental and Risk Management departments.  The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) is the Administrating Agency for the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).\n\nAir Liquide has developed and maintains an emergency action plan for the Wilmington CO2 Plant.  In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, the Wilmington CO2 Plant will respond defensively by notifying (and then assisting with any needed process information) the Conoco Phillips emergency response team that there is a need to respond to a release of the regulated substance.  The Wilmington CO2 Plant also maintains communications with the Los Angeles Fire Department as part of its Risk Management emergency response planning. In the event of a release the Wilmington CO2 Plant will notify California Office of Emergency Services along with other State and Federal Emergency agencies.  If release is expected to have offsite consequences that could impact the community, the Unified Command, which includes CP Incident Commander, Air Liquide Emergency Coordinator and LAFD Incident Commander will coordinate the appropriate community response (evacuation, shelter-in-place).  \n\nThe Wilmington CO2 Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention.  In the past five years, there has not been an accident that has caused deaths, injuries, property damage or environmental damage, nor one requiring evacuation or shelter-in-place for the surrounding community.\n"
