ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY \nRESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Union Carbide Taft/Star Complex is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareO requirements and governmental requirements, such as, the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n \n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nUnion Carbide?s Taft /Star Plant is a petrochemical manufacturing facility that converts petroleum-based raw materials into a variety of basic building block and intermediate chemicals for customers in many parts of the world.  The facility also produces polyethylene plastic pellets that are shipped worldwide. \n\nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Taft /Star Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  . The Union Carbide Taft/Star Complex has 17 chemicals in threshold quantities encompassed by this rule. They are as follows: Acetaldehyde (f) , Acrolein (t), Ammonia (t) , Butadiene (f) , Butene (f) , Ethane (f) , Ethyl Ether (f) , Ethylene (f) , Ethylene Oxide (t) , Ethylenediamine (t)  , Hydrogen (f) , Isopentane (f) , Methyl Mercaptan (t) , Peracetic Acid (t) , Propane (f), Propylene (f), Vinyl Methyl "

KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario. General steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring and to mitigate their effects should they occur appear in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemical (s)\n \n    Worst-case Release Scenario(s)\n\nAcrolein - This scenario assumes an instantaneous failure of the tank walls and safety systems releases the entire contents of a 186,000 lb. tank in 10 minutes, with the worst possible weather conditions ( no wind, low humidity). According to OCA Guidance Table , this release could impact off-site public receptors. \nIn addition to proper engineering , design and construction, the accident prevention in place consists of the following: \n? Inventory Restriction - Written operating procedures and a high-level shutoff system limits the maximum filling capacity with redundant overfill protection.\n? Tank is enclosed in concrete bunker under an earthen mound. \n? Special service design standards and special inspection and testing is done. \n? The pressure relief devices are routed to a flare system. \n? A reaction prevention system , which includes an inhibitor system, multiple emergency dump and disposal facilities, redundant temperature monitoring.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) \n\nAcrolein - This scenario assumes a transfer line develops a flange leak and approximately 500 lbs. of Acrolein  is lost to the atmosphere. The wind speed is 3 meters/sec. and the stability class D is used. An individual detects the release, actuates the alarm system, and unit personnel isolate the leak in 30 minutes.

GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\n    CHEMICAL PREVENTION STEPS\nAt Union Carbide we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the Louisiana Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of Union Carbide's Operational Safety Program and Episodic Risk Management System.  Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipme"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nDuring the last five years,  there have been no accidental releases from covered processes at the Taft/Star Plant that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Taft / Star Complex Plant maintains an emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility\nof a fire or explosion if a flammab"

Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n? Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n? Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n? Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Taft / Star Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  Information is shared  with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release from our facility. Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S. The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the St. Charles Parish Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Taft / Star Complex to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n- Reduce the volume of stored ammonia by 50% with a change in operating philosophy to use only one tank of liquid ammonia versus two. Also, install magnetic sight glass in the ammonia storage area which reduces the possibility of an amm"
