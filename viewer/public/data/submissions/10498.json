              "Description": "In accordance with Sections 68.65 through 68.87, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake has implemented a program 3 prevention program for the following processes;\n\n    7 Chlorine Storage Area for Wastewater Treatment Plant\n    7 Supply Department Cylinder Storage Site\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION: In accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake systematically controls the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with its process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of the risk management program.  This information is also used directly to ensure that its equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS: In accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake uses process hazard analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.  The most important products of its PHAs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake ensures that all recommendations from its PHAs are resolved appropriately, and ensures that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES: In accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake uses operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to its personnel should be performed to avoid incidents.  Managers use these procedures to (1) train employees/contractors before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n\nTRAINING: In accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake trains its employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  As part of its training, provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training (written tests, field demonstrations, etc.) are included.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY: In accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake maintains the mechanical integrity (MI) of our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and a quality assurance program, and ensures that its equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly.  Maintenance personnel are trained in the hazards of the process, and also provided additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: In accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake evaluates and approves all proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through our management of change (MOC) program. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that our employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.  Close scrutiny of all changes is used to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW: In accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake performs a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS: In accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake audits our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  The compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS: In accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake performs incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: In accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake has an employee participation plan that helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\nHOT-WORK PERMITS: In accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake uses its hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.\n\nCONTRACTORS: In accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake has a contractor screening procedure to help ensure that only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of our plant employees, the public, or the environment are hired and used.",

R.\n  Propane Storage Site #9 G-2\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION: In accordance with Section 68.48 of the RMP rule, NAvAIRWPNSTA China Lake compiles and maintains written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment similar to those described in the process safety element of our program 3 prevention program.  This information is necessary for supporting all other elements of our risk management program and is also used directly to ensure that our equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW: In accordance with Section 68.50 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake uses hazard reviews to systematically identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with regulated substances, processes, and procedures.  The most important products of hazard reviews are an enhanced understanding of process hazards and recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  All recommendations from our hazard reviews are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES: In accordance with Section 68.52 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake uses operating procedures similar to those described in the operating procedures element of its program 3 prevention program to define how process-related job tasks should be performed to avoid incidents.  Operating procedures are used to (1) train employees before they operate the process equipment, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing maintenance tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n\nTRAINING: In accordance with Section 68.54 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake trains employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Training programs for our program 2 processes are carried out under the training element of program 3 prevention program.\n\nMAINTENANCE:  In accordance with Section 68.56 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake has maintenance programs that address more than just equipment repairs.  Rather, maintenance programs for  program 2 processes are included as a part of the mechanical integrity element of program 3 prevention program.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS: In accordance with Section 68.58 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake audits our facilities to be certain that risk management plans are being effectively implemented.  The compliance audit program seeks to confirm that risk management practices for processes are consistent with written programs, that the programs are adequate to address all requirements of the EPA RMP rule, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS: In accordance with Section 68.60 of the RMP rule, NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake performs incident investigations to help ensure that the root causes of incidents are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated to employees to help prevent a recurrence of (1) the same or similar incident and (2) other seemingly unrelated potential incidents that share one or more underlying root causes.  The incident investigation program for program 2 processes is carried out as a part of the incident investigation element of program 3 prevention program.",

In addition, all work areas hold periodic safety meetings to discuss site specific hazards.  Hazardous materials worker training records are kept in a database maintained on site for three years by the Hazardous Materials Division.\n\nSEISMIC EVALUATION OF BUILDINGS AT NAWS CHINA LAKE\n\nSeismic evaluation of the buildings at NAVAIRWPNSTA China Lake is conducted for the ground motion specified by the Western Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The seismicity of the region and the development of a site response spectrum have been presented in the report \"Earthquake Vulnerability Study of the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, Phase I: Preliminary Study\" (TM No. 51-80-27), by T. K. Lew, dated November 1980.  The response spectra was established for a design earthquake with an 80% probability of not being exceeded in a 50 year period.\n\nAll buildings are analyzed utilizing linear-elastic mathematical models of the structures.  These mathematical models are developed based on data obtained from the drawings supplied by China Lake, site visits, field measurements, photographs and specifications.  Seismic loads are determined by a linear-elastic dynamic analysis for the previously described earthquake ground motions.  Anticipated damage to structures is evaluated by comparing the seismic induced loads with the performance criterion.  The assumption of a linear-elastic model is consistent with the relatively low stress levels found in the majority of the structural elements.  This approach is considered the acceptable standard for seismic evaluation studies.\n\nThe response spectra are site specific for the China Lake area an"

The study included a detailed seismic analysis, a visual inspection, and evaluation of the seismic performance, recommended strengthening procedures and an engineering estimate of rehabilitation costs for each of the study buildings.  The analysis was carried out in sufficient detail to determine the structural adequacy of the buildings and its elements when considering either \"mission essential\" or \"life safety\" criteria.  These criteria are as follows:\n\n    Mission Essential Criteria:  The building is to remain functional after the design earthquake.\n    Life Safety Criteria:  The building is to resist collapse after the design earthquake.\n\nThe vulnerability of non-structural elements (equipment, architectural components and life-line utilities) are evaluated during visual inspections of the buildings.\n\nElements capable of disabling the operations of a building or of creating a falling hazard during an earthquake are identified.  This applies only to those elements available to the visual inspection.\n\nSince Building 00005 consists of two separate structures, thirteen individual reports were made.

CERTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR PROGRAM 1 PROCESSES:\n\nBased on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following processes is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor for the following processes: \n\na Propane Storage Site #2, \na Propane Storage Site #3, \na Propane Storage Site #4, \na Propane Storage Site #5, \na Propane Storage Site #7, and \na Propane Storage Site #8.  \n\nWithin the last five years, the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10 (b) (1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire or explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.
