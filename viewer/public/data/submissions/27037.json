The Facility Policy\n     The owners, managment, and employees of Pawnee County Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to wrk with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to famers.  Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  The maximum quantity handled would be 157,600 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n     -The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank.  That amount would be 65,662 pounds which represents 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint is  4.7 miles.\n     -The alternative release scenario would be 100 lbs. traveling a distance of .2 miles.  This would affect 8 people.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K 61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History\n     There has been no accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6.  The Emergency Action Plan\n     This facility has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR  1910.38.  They have provided state and local autho"
