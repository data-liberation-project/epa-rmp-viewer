The Facility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees of ConAgra International Fertilizer are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are \nencouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and from time to time include \nportions of the management plan in those meetings.  The Facility maintains a internal \nwritten emergency contingency plan. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \nprepared to work with local emergency responders, and other authorities to mitigate any \nrelease, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \ncommunity in the area. Anhydrous ammonia is received, store, and used in the production \nof non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important source of Nitrogen \nfor agricultural crops during the spring and fall of the year.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facilities stationary storage is 520,000 \npounds.  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing \n40,000 pounds. From time to time the Facility receives ammonia rail cars to use in the \n10-34-0 batch process.  Both the rail cars and transports are unloaded through a transfer \nsystem designed and maintained in accordance to industry and ANSI Standards for \nhandling ammonia.  The 10-34-0 batch process is a large consumer of the product but is \nintermittently operated.  \n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, constr"

The Facility continues to review and \nlook for means to improve operating and best management practices for increase safety. \n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n       \nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \nin  the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property \ndamage at the Facility.  \n         \nTo the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \nproperty damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the operation of this \nfacility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  \"Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \nAgricultural\" 1991.\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  \"Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \nFertilizer Institute.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \"Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \nPrevention Advisory ?
