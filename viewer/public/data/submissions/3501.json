These chemicals are used to manufacture\nsurfactants.  The end products of the Gurnee site using the\nRMP chemicals as raw materials are used for personal care,\nfood additives and automotive coatings.\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\nz    The worst case scenario as defined by the RMP\n  regulation is a toxic gas release of ethylene oxide with off-\n  site impacts. No administrative or passive mitigation\n  measures have been used to define the worst case scenario as\n  prescribed by the EPA. In practice the Gurnee site has\n  layers of protection to prevent the actual occurrence of the\n  worst case scenario.\n\nAlternative Case(s)\n\nz    The alternate case scenario as defined by the RMP\n  regulation is a toxic liquid release of ethylene oxide with\n  off-site impacts.  Active mitigation controls were\n  considered such as emergency shutdown systems to control the\n  release.\n\nz    The alternate case scenario as defined by the RMP\n  regulation is a toxic liquid release of propylene oxide with\n  off-site impacts.

Hazmat team members\nare trained and participate in drills regularly. Annual\ndrills are conducted with local municipal responders.\nEmployees are trained how to identify an emergency and how\nto adequately respond.
