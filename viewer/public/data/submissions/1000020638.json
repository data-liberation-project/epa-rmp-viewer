The facility includes a 170,000 sq. ft. main manufacturing and administrative office building and a 4,200 sq. ft. Research and Development Laboratory. The company employs approximately 200 people and manufactures a variety of hand-held torches used primarily in the plumbing industry and for other commercial and household applications.\n\nThe manufacturing facility is comprised of two main operations; a Machining Department for the machining of brass rod stock, using screw machines to produce internal and external torch components; and, an Assembly Department where a variety of torches are assembled and packaged for sale. In addition to the manufacturing operations, the main building has a Distribution Center where finished product is stored and prepared for delivery to customers, and hand held propane and propylene cylinders are stored. A Shipping and Receiving Department is also located within the main manufacturing building for receiving raw materials.   \nAt any given time, there may be more than 300,000 lbs of propane in various individual one to two pound cylinders at the site that are stored in close proximity to each other.  In addition, the facility also uses a number of 100-lb propane cylinders in its quality assurance and test areas for the torch assemblies. Therefore, based on the onsite inventory of propane at any given time, the BernzOmatic facility is subject to the applicability requirements of 40 CFR 68.10(b) Program 1 level facilities as described below:\n\nProgram 1: Processes which would not affect the public in the case of a worst-case release and with no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the past five years are eligible for Program 1, which imposes limited hazard assessment requirements and minimal prevention and emergency response requirements. \n\nIt is BernzOmatic's policy to conduct all business activities, including chemical safety, in a man"
