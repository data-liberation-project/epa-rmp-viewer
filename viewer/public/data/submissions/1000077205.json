Bulk anhydrous ammonia is received via transport trucks and stored for the eventual sale to farmers. This facility is subject to the Risk Management Program rule as a Program Level 2 facility. The executive summary is our first means of communicating the risk to the public but also outlining our preventative program to further demonstrate we are a safe operator.\n\n\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nWe are a non-responding facility. However, we coordinate  with the LEPC on an annual basis our internal Emergency Action Plan and ensure we are still currently included in the community emergency response program. Our Emergency Action Plan provides procedures for our employees to conduct in the event  of an uncontrolled release or any other RMP reportable incident.\n\nWe do our best to prevent accidental releases. We have well trained staff, established SOP's, and active and passive mitigation measures that act as additional fail-safe design. \n\n\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThis stationary source consists of a bulk tank and multiple nurse tanks of anhydrous ammonia. Exact quantities are withheld from this executive summary as a means of protection from potential malicious acts. The facility does hold in excess of the threshold planning quantity which is subject to the RMP rule. The process is very simple. We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck, store it in a bulk tank and then transfer it to smaller, portable, nurse tanks for farm use and application into the soil for crop nutrients.\n\n\n\n\n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur overall Management System is laid out in out Risk Management Program. Overall implementation is the responsibility of the General Manager. This facility has developed a worse-case and alternative release sce"

Safety information - This information outlines the overall hazards of our regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, includes our maximum intended inventory, safe upper & lower operating limits, provides equipment specifications, and list any RAGAGEP we have deemed appropriate for our facility.\n\n   2. Hazard Review - This is a systemic approach used to identify hazards associated with our process that include human error and equipment malfunction, as well as safeguards needed to prevent that from occurring. It also includes steps needed to detect and monitor releases.\n\n   3. Operating Procedures - We have developed specific operating procedures for our facility. Our employees have been trained in the appropriate procedures for their prospective duties. These procedures include initial start up, normal and temporary operations, normal and emergency shutdown, startup after a normal or emergency shutdown, equipment inspections and consequences of deviations and how to correct or avoid those deviations.\n\n   4. Training - Our employees are trained at least every 3 years on the respective procedures and hazards associated with the process.\n\n   5. Maintenance - We have established maintenance schedule that is based on RAGAGEP including manufacturer's recommendations when available. In the instances that those are unavailable, we use prior operating experience. We understand that inspection and maintenance operators need further training, so we ensure each employee involved in the on-going mechanical integrity of the process has been trained in the hazards of the process, how to avoid or correct unsafe situations, and procedures applicable to the job tasks. When we do utilize contractors at our anhydrous ammonia facility, we ensure that the contractors are trai"

This audit is to determine if we have met our obligations under applicable parts of 40CFR Part 68. Any deficiencies our outlined in our compliance audit with a timeline of expected completion. Ideally we approach these as safety deficiencies, take a higher precedence that compliance or paperwork deficiencies.\n\n   7. Incident Investigations - if we have incidents, we investigate them thoroughly to determine the cause and means to prevent it from occurring again. This facility has had no incidents to investigate in the previous 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences in the previous 5 years. Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain this record.\n\n\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, we are an non-responding facility and have met the requirements of an Emergency Action Plan as well as coordinated efforts with our LEPC. Furthermore, we have exercised our emergency notification procedures each calendar year beginning by 12/19/2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCurrently our facility meets current RAGAGEP and there are no plans currently in place to improve safety other than continually evaluating our current program and efforts for continuous improvement. When newer RAGAGEP is published, our company will evaluate it at the time and determine if enhancements need to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
