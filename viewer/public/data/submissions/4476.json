      "SummaryText": "Taos Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nRMP Plan Executive Summary\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Taos Wastewater Treatment Plant (Taos WWTP), owned by the Town of Taos and operated by Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI).\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\nOMI believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, OMI has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Taos WWTP RMP for the ammonia system.  OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Taos WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nOMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., ammonia at the"

The employees that work on the ammonia system are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nOMI management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Taos WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Taos WWTP is located at 182 Los Cordova Road, Taos County, New Mexico.  The Taos WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  The facility is a 1.0 MGD activated sludge/oxidation ditch operation.\n\nThe Taos WWTP utilizes ammonia in its on-site fertilizer plant.  The ammonia is stored in one-12,000 gallon container (approximately 50,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Taos WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of ammonia stored and used at the facility.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that a full container of chemical is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions as specified in the RMP regulation are also assumed to be present.  The release is also assumed to occur outdoors.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, th"

No active mitigation was considered.\n\nResults of the off-site consequence analyses are described in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*Submit plan for the Taos WWTP.\n\nPrevention Steps for Ammonia\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Taos WWTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n7 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n\n7 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the ammonia process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n\n7 Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions\n\n7 Training for each Taos WWTP employee involved in operating the ammonia system\n\n7 Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the ammonia process equipment\n\n7 Management of change procedures to manage changes (other than \"replacements in kind\") to the ammonia system\n\n7 Pre-startup safety review for additions or significant modifications to the ammonia process, or any new regulated chemical process\n\n7 Compliance audits at least every three years from 1999 to evaluate Taos WWTP RMP compliance\n\n7 Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia from the Taos WWTP\n\n7 Employee participation in the development and implementation of the Taos WWTP RMP, and employee a"

The program is described in detail in the Taos WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Taos WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Taos WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.
