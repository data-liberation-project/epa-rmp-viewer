The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nThunderbird Pool Service, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1982.  The process is located at 10803 Brooklet, Houston, Texas 77099.  The chlorine transfer process for Thunderbird Pool Service, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers (maximum of 5) which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from a one ton container through a filling manifold to 20 pound cylinders (maximum of 94).  The system also includes a scrubber water tank.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 10,000 pounds.  The filling station is located under a canopy and behind a fire wall. \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability. The reference table from the EPA's RM"

No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 72 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThunderbird Pool Service, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of chlorine at this facility over the last five years (6/21/94 through 6/21/99).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Thunderbird Pool Service, Inc.'s response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively"

This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at Thunderbird Pool Service, Inc.  The recommendations are scheduled to be implemented by July 15, 1999 unless otherwise noted.\n\nR01 Ensure that the new chlorine sensor/alarm system is installed in a timely manner.  Document the actions taken by the chlorine sensor if a leak of chlorine is detected.  Thunderbird Pool Service would like to note that this recommendation was completed on 6/3/99.  The new sensor was installed and the actions to take to respond to an alarm have been documented.\n\nR02 For all personal protective equipment (such as gas masks, goggles/face shields, glove, etc.) ensure that proper training is provided and documented.  Thunderbird Pool Service would like to note that this recommendation was completed on 5/28/99. \n\nR03 Provide labeling on valves and controls.\n\nR04 Ensure that all operators are aware of what they are expected to do in case of an alarm at the facility.  Thunderbird Pool Service would like to note that this recommendation was completed on 5/28/99. \n\nR05 Install and locate the windsock such that employees can see it from all areas of the facility.  Thunderbird Pool Service would like to note that a windsock has been purchased and is in progress of being installed. \n\nR06 Consider installing a remote shut down switch interlocked with a valve in the chlorine liquid feed line.\n\nR07 Post evacuation instructions including routes and assembly areas.  Thunderbird Pool Service would like to note that this recommendation is in progress of being completed.\n\nR08 Post emergency phone numbers in the office.
