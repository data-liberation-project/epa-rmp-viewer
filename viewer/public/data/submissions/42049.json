      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only martial considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has two 30,000-gallon tanks, one 5,000-gallon tank, and two 4,000-gallon tanks, and equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1.    Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2.    Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent over pressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3.    Inspections by insurance loss control specialists to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Gruver Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA a release according to this scenario would include the town of Gruver.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA?s worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, such a release would affect residences near our facility, but would not include the high school."
