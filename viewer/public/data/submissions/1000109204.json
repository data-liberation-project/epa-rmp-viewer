In addition to ASME pressure vessel code, Wilbur-Ellis follows Compressed Gas Association Standard G-2.1 as RAGAGEP.  Process Hazards Analyses are facilitated by third party consultants experienced in the methodology.  \nChemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tank for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nWilbur-Ellis is a non-responding stationary source. Personnel are trained to respond to small ammonia releases (e.g., drips and fugitive emissions) using full face respirators and appropriate PPE.  The site coordinates with the Regent Rural Fire Protection District (fire department) regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n1)\tProcedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n2)\tInformation on emergency health care.\n3)\tEmergency response training for employees.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nWilbur-Ellis is implementing a proprietary comprehensive Safety Management System called Guiding People to Safety (GPS). Key safety elements are established and divided into four discrete steps, which direct the site on continuous improvement. RMP/PSM is one of those key el"

The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis. In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 1803 4th Street Northeast in Hettinger, North Dakota (the facility). Wilbur- Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure. There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into nurse tanks owned by farmers. There may be a maximum of six 1,450-gallon nurse tanks owned by farmers at the facility at a given time. The contents of the storage tank are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.\nThe facility is usually unmanned, with the exception of about one month per year, when a full time employee from another Wilbur-Ellis branch is assigned.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \nThe Hettinger location follows the Program 3 Accidental"
