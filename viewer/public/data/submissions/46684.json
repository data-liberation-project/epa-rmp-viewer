The company?s management maintains an active role in ensuring that environmental compliance takes place through an active review of its safety and environmental plans. A pro-active approach has been adopted through establishing a preventive approach to chemical safety. The preventive program addresses employee participation and training, process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity reviews, compliance audits, and change management.\n\nThe facility, which utilizes 118,000 square feet, is located on highway 61 South in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The company employs 100 people and operates year round. The primary products consist of polystyrene egg cartons, food and serving trays. Polystyrene crystals are extruded to make rolls of polystyrene, which is subsequently formed using various molds and dies in thermoforming machines. Pentane, an EPA regulated substance, is used to expand the polystyrene crystals. The maximum amount stored at the facility is 34,000 lbs. \n\nThe operation at Foam Packaging complies with OSHA-PSM rule. In keeping with that rule, the company employs a preventive maintenance program to address hazards within the company?s operation. For example, the processes operating procedures have been defined and documented for startup, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdowns. Employee training is an on going process to ensure that those individuals who are a part of the covered process understand the hazards and appropriate responses. An inspection program is in place to test the mechanical integrity of the covered process. The program consists of visual and mechanical verification of the components to ensure their operation. \n\nDuring the past five years as well as the life of the process, the company has not experienced any release of Pentane.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response system in conjunction with the Vicksburg Em"
