EPA Region 9 and the State of Nevada CAPP, along with the Clark County Fire Department (CCFD) inspectors, engaged in a multi-agency audit of the AMSWTF RMP program on May 13, 2009.  AMSWTF also conducted an evacuation drill in May 2009 and carried out an ERP table top exercise on May 20, 2009.  \r\n\r\nThe State of Nevada CAPP Division, after the last RMP submittal to EPA in 2009, had also been conducting annual audits of the AMSWTF chlorine system on: January 10, 2011, September 12, 2012 and July 23, 2013.  The next CAPP audit is scheduled for June 17, 2014.  \r\n\r\nThe combination of the aforementioned technology, administrative controls, regulatory audit and self inspection, and employee dedication has resulted in no accidental release of chlorine exceeding the 10 pound reportable quantity during the past 15 years at AMSWTF.\r\n\r\nThe SNWS shall strive to remain in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulatory mandates and continues to execute our PSM/RMP/CAPP program through continuous review and improvement.  Process hazard analysis (PHA), standard operating procedures review, maintenance activities, and trainings are ongoing.  SNWS had also developed an chlorine emergency response plan (ERP) as a stand alone document, independent of the ERP under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), while maintaining desired integration and uniformity among the various emergency response plans mandated by different government agencies including DHS, OSHA, EPA and CAPP."

The goal of the SNWS senior management team is to achieve full compliance with the applicable federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, as well as the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  \r\n\r\nOur commitment to total chemical safety is demonstrated through: \r\n1.) The employment of a full-time chemical engineer at the water treatment plant who is dedicated to evaluate and improve the water treatment processes, \r\n2.) A process safety engineer is assigned to SNWS to focus on the OSHA PSM, EPA RMP and Nevada CAPP compliance programs, \r\n3.)

Working with the State of Nevada OSHA office and State of Nevada CAPP Division on their audits/ inspections of the AMSWTF Chlorination System as part of the continuous improvement efforts.  \r\n\r\nSNWS has two water treatment facilities with a combined total maximum production capacity of 900 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water. Both are situated in remote locations and away from the densely populated areas of Clark County, Nevada. The AMSWTF is the larger of the two facilities and the only one that use chlorine as disinfectant in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP covered chemical.   \r\n\r\nThe SNWS water treatment process starts by pumping raw water from Lake Mead into a contactor building to undergo ozone disinfection where ozone and oxygen gas mixture generated on-site are diffused, mixed and dissolved into water traveling through the contactor to achieve desired disinfection.  In the event the ozone generation system is down for maintenance, AMSWTF can use chlorine gas as a back-up disinfectant.  \r\n\r\nFollowing ozone disinfection, the ozonated water flows through a channel to the rapid mixers where a coagulant aid is added to combine the waterborne suspended particles.  Water then flows into multiple flocculation basins where the gentle mixing of water and coagulant aid causes the suspended particles to form larger clumps called floc.  \r\n\r\nFrom the flocculation basins, water flows to the multi-media filters where the last step of physical polishing takes place.  As water passes through these filters, floc is trapped and collected and the filtered water passes through to the storage clearwell.  A corrosion inhibitor"

The finished water is now ready to be distributed to water users that include City of Boulder City, Clark County, City of Henderson, City of Las Vegas, City of North Las Vegas, and outlying areas.   \r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine is stored in trailers and shipped to AMSWTF by truck transport then kept in two enclosed buildings which have equipment to park the trailers and to evaporate the liquid chlorine for use as disinfectant.  Access to the two chlorine buildings is restricted to SNWS employees, authorized contractors, or visitors. AMSWTF also maintains an onsite meteorological monitoring station. The prevailing winds at AMSWTF are to the north-northwest; towards the Saddle Island cove and Lake Mead area.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine facility was designed and constructed in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, and complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure chemical safety, a multitude of technological steps have been incorporated into the AMSWTF chlorine system:\r\n\r\n1.) The entire process is housed inside two chlorine buildings and is monitored and controlled remotely by operators located in a separate control room, \r\n2.) Chlorine sensors are located inside the two chlorine buildings to continuously monitor chlorine level, \r\n3.) The same two buildings are kept under a slight vacuum, i.e., the pressure inside the building is slightly less than the outside ambient pressure; such a set-up minimizes chlorine leaking from inside the building to the outside, \r\n4.)
