      "SummaryText": "This document was developed for the City of Cambridge's Wastewater Treatment Facility in an effort to fulfill criteria of the Risk Management Program (RMP), as required by section 112A? of the Clean Air Act (CAA), and regulated by 40 CFR, Part 68, published June 20,1996, and amended June 21, 2004. The wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) utilizes primary and secondary biological treatment processes. The Facility has an extensive Risk Management Program that follows OSHA and EPA guidelines. The program emphasizes employee training,emergency response, and equipment inspection/maintenance.       The WWTF stores and utilizes chlorine in one ton cylinders. Maximum quantity on-site at any given time is 8000 pounds. RMP*Submit 2004 was used to conduct the worst-case release scenario for chlorine. Additionally, enclosures (e.g. buildings) were considered as passive mitigation measures in the analysis, which reduced the impact of a potential release. The analysis calculated an impact radius of 0.9 miles. This impact radius would result in an offsite impact (members of the public could  be exposed to toxic concentrations).                                                                                                                                     For the alternative scenario, the same prcedures and mitigation measures were used as listed above for the worst case release scenario. The scenario chosen for analysis was a hole in one of the storage cylinders. Both of these scenarios assumes the scrubber does not engage. The analysis showed an impact radius of 0.2 miles. The impact radius would not result in a residential off-site impact.                                                                                                                                                 The Facility has a dialer system that notifies personnel of a release during non-working hours. This ensures a release can be identified 24 hour a day."
