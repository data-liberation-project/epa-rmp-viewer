This value was determined by using the attached summary developed by EOC. The attached information provides specific details of the chlorine release.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe scenario modeled under the alternate release scenario was a leak from a whip connecting the cylinder to a distribution header. Chlorine is expected to leak through a hole of approximately 0.4  inches in area and continue for 1 hour (maximum).  Using the attached data supplied by EOC,  this scenario produced an endpoint of 0.5 ppm at a total distance of 1055 yards.  No active or passive mitigation measures were assumed to mitigate the release.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHLORINE RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nThe critical elements that the Parish uses to prevent accidental releases are the recently reviewed and updated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Mechanical Integrity Program, and Training Program. These three programs have a significant impact in the continued safe operation of the chlorine system. \n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents, as defined in 40 CFR 68.42, at the Pond in the last five (5) years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs descriped above, personnel at the Pond will not act as responders to uncontrollable releases of chlorine. Rather, the Emergency Action Plan will be implemented which notifies the Parish's EOC .EOC will provide support and technical assistance to contain chlorine releases beyond the ability of Parish personnel. The Pond is included in the community emergency response plan for the Parish of St. Charles. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Parish intends to convert the current pressure system to a vacuum system that will mitigate the total potential quantity of"

Continuous review of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and mechanical integrity programs help to ensure that the chlorine system is operated and maintained in a safe manner. The Department provides formal training for all operators and maintenance personnel focusing on chlorine safety. Annual audits are conducted by  representataives of the Parish's Emergency Operations Center (EOC)  to familiarize themselves with the chlorine system.\n\nEmergency Response Policies: Operators at the Luling Oxidation Pond will not respond to leaks beyond their ability to control through the use of valves. In the event of such a release, plant personnel will notify  EOC and evacuate the area. EOC will establish a safe perimeter and begin public notification. EOC will handle all emergency procedures and evacuation. The facility is included in the Local Emergency Planning Committee's community emergency response plan.\n\nTHE WESTBANK WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe Luling Oxidation Pond (Pond) is a 2.2 million gallons per day oxidation pond that serves the Luling area of St. Charles Parish. Treated effluent from the plant is discharged to the George Cousins Canal. Disinfection of the effluent is accomplished by injecting chlorine into the effluent box. Chlorine is stored in a maximum of twelve-one ton cylinders. The Pond is owned and operated by the Parish. It is located in the Parish's wetlands which surround it on all sides and can only be accessed via a single road.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE\n\nThe worst case release at the West Bank WWTP, the St. Charles Parish EOC Coordinator, involves the release of the entire contents of 6 one-ton cylinders over a one minute period equating to a 200 lb/sec release rate.
