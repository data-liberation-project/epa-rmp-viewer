Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nAtlas Cold Storage believes that our workplace should be run in a manner that reduces and/or eliminates the potential for injuries in the workplace.\nThat the cost of injury and illness to employees and damage to Company property is unacceptable.\nThat no job is so important and no service is so urgent that we cannot take the time to perform them safely.\nThat all employees have an individual responsibility in the Company safety program to protect themselves, their co-workers and Company facilities.\nThat in an attempt to minimize the personal and financial loss that can be caused by accidental injury, Management is held accountable for providing safe work conditions for all employees and applying and enforcing safe work practices.\nTherefore, it is the policy of Atlas Cold Storage to conduct our operations in a manner that will prevent injuries to people and damage to Company property and equipment and the will comply with all applicable  regulations for safety and health.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The General Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs.\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence , and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nB.

      "SummaryText": "nd storage warehouse for the perishable food industry.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing  capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of the system is 40,000 lbs.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n    The closed ammonia refrigeration system removes heat from the storage and blast freezers of the 2.0 million cubic foot facility.  The refrigeration system provides two-stage and single-stage operation with screw compressors for the -35! blast and -10! freezers.  The sub-zero temperatures are provided with low pressure ammonia suction and liquid lines via pumped recirculating accumulators.  The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for the machine room.\n\nC.    Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\n\nD.    Five-Year Accident History\nNo ammonia-related incidents were identified for the facility in the previous five years which resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\nE.    Description of the Emergency Response Program\nThis facility has an Eme"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIt is the intent of Atlas Cold Storage to not only meet any regulatory requirement, but to also take a pro-active approach into implementing these requirements as part of a working safety plan. Atlas Cold Storage is in a constant review process in its operations and industry standards to provide a safe working environment for our employees.\n\n\n\nAtlas Cold Storage\nCartersville, Georgia"
