The butane blending system was engineered and constructed to meet the NFPA #58 1998 Edition.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Detroit Fire Department (Station #48 is the initial responder) as well as the Wayne County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local (EMS out of Station #48) Emergency Management Services and Oakwood Hospital.  This facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team (Technician Level) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  Additional hazmat capabilities are provided by Detroit's HazMat Unit 56.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Detroit Terminal is a bulk refined petroleum storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one storage vessel.\r\n\r\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed by the system (85%) automatic shutoff resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate release scenario (potential for off-site impacts) is a vapor cloud explosion of a 10 minute pipe release.  Both scenarios, although extremely unlikely, have the potential for the distance to endpoint to extend off-site and affect both public and environmental receptors.\r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Detroit Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CF"
