Pool Chlor has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1975.\n\nPool Chlor's owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company facility has been in operation since 1975.  The facility is located at 13716 Carmenita Rd., in Santa Fe Springs, California 90670.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company facility receives and repackages liquefied chlorine into small 15 pound cylinders that are then used to treat water at local private residence swimming pools.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site is 7 one-ton containers (14,000 pounds).  The entire system including the fill station, one-ton containers, scrubber tank and pump, is located outside.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company chlorine transfer system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Pool Chlor Company facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nA chlorine sensor is located in the Chlorine Storage Area that activat"

An uninterruptible power source (UPS) is used to power the chlorine sensor and associated displays in the case of a power outage.  The chlorine alarm status is monitored by an off-site company during off hours.  An emergency kill switch is interlocked with a motorized solenoid actuator valve to stop liquid flow from the active one-ton container.\n\nAll one-ton containers are maintained chained to a cradle.  The idle 15 pound cylinders are kept in a locked storage area with the scrubber pump and tank.\n\nAs policy, new Pool Chlor Company employees must be directly observed by an experienced operator while performing the chlorine transfer operation for six months of employment.  This is considered a very conservative approach based on the simplicity of the operation.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment (dated April 6, 2004), the five year accident history investigation (April 1999 - April 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPool Chlor Company has coordinated emergency action efforts with the local fire department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Pool Chlor Company to evacuate and to allow the fire department and/or the chemical supplier to respond to the emergency.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nP"
