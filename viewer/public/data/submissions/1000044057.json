Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe management and staff of the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant are committed to operating the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with the highest regard for the safety of the public, plant personnel, and the environment. To ensure safety for the public, plant personnel, and the environment, the facility has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68. The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source, Regulated Substance Handled, Process Description\n\n\n\n1. The ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the facility which is subject to the EPA rule and OSHA Standards \n\n\n\n2. Anydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance in the ammonia refrigeration system.  At ambient temperature and presure it is a colroless gas with an irritating odor.  It is highly soluble in water. The chemcial formula for anhydrous ammonia is NH3.\n\n\n\n3. The anhyrous ammonia maximum intended inventory is 44,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n4. The closed loop mechanical refrigeration system cycles the refrigerant (anhydrous ammonia) from liquid to gas and back again.  The ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the process.  The system cycles the ammonia through various physical states , high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid , High pressure vapor and low pressure vapor in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe Plant(milk and ice cream) has an accidental release prevention program in place that complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process safety Management Standard.  It consist of the folling elements:\n\n  1. Process Safety Information\n\n  2. Emp"

Five Year Accident History \n\n\n\nOver the past five years the Bellevue facility has not had any anhydous ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or off-site consequesnces. \n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Bellevue facility has an emergency action plan in place that addresses emergency releases, notifications, and evacuations.  Emergency activities are coordinated with the local fire department.  In the event of an emergency release the facility will call 9-1-1 for assistance.  The facililty is responsible for the evacuation and ensuring the safety of its emplloyee in an emergency.  Facility personnel  receive training in the emergency action plan and take part in annual evacuation drills.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of a release that exceed 100 lbs. of ammonia in a 24 hour period, the facililty will notidfy the Natiionall Response Center, State emergency management and Local EPA/EPCRA offices. \n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Bellevue facililty has a management system in place that is designed to ensure the implementation of each program element in compliance with the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP rule.  Authority, responsiblity, and accountability are assigned to facility management and staff.  On going compliance audits, revaladations, and inspections help to continuously improve on the program prevention elements.  Continuous training is provided for ammonia operators to improve and ensure,the safety of the system and personnel"
