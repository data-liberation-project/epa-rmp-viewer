Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Porterville Citrus Organics has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n\r\n(3) Storage Rooms\r\n(1) Precool Room\r\n(1) Hydrocooler\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. \r\nThe control valve groups are located on the roof. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly outside the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\r\n\r\nMachinery Room\r\n(4) Reciprocating compressors\r\n(4) Oil separators\r\n\r\nOutside Machinery Room\r\n(2) High pressure receivers\r\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\r\n(1) Evaporative condenser\r\n(1) Hydrocooler\r\n(1) Emergency control box\r\n(1) Ammonia diffusion tank\r\n\r\nMachinery Room Roof\r\n(1) Evaporative Condenser\r\n(1) Main suction accumulator\r\n\r\nPrecool Room\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(2) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nRoom 1\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(2) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nRoom 2\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nRoom 3\r\n(1) Accumulator\r\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, spiral fin)\r\n\r\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall.

The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed on the east exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Porterville Citrus Organics consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Porterville Citrus Organics is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 11,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.

Nevertheless, Porterville Citrus Organics continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Porterville Citrus Organics' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Porterville Citrus Organics' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nPorterville Citrus Organics has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Porterville Citrus Organics has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Porterville Citrus Organics now thinks o"
