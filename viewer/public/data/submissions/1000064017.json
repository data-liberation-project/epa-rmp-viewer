An estimated maximum storage quantity of 59,631 lbs. of hydrogen sulfide can be present at this concentration in the K-478 storage tank. The catastrophic failure of the tank results in a toxic endpoint distance of 13.0 miles (20.9 kilometers).\r\n\r\nMARPLOT was utilized to estimate the population impacted by this accidental release. This worst-case scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 250,273 people (102,689 residences). Multiple schools including Norco Elementary, Sacred Heart of Jesus, and Bethune High School could be impacted by this scenario. Bayou Trepagnier, which is a designated scenic stream and is located adjacent to the northern fence line at the storage and treatment area, could also be affected by this release scenario.

Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #1 - Hydrochloric Acid (concentration 37% or greater)\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloric acid toxic alternative release scenario chosen occurs at the hydrochloric acid storage tank (L-432), which has a release as a result of a 3 transfer hose line leak during vessel charging. A calculated amount of 28,900 pounds of hydrochloric acid (37% concentration) will be released in approximately 10 minutes before mitigation of the leak can occur. This scenario was selected due to a history of similar releases that have occurred during similar tank transfer operations and because of the locat"

      "SummaryText": "CE ANALYSIS (OCA)\r\nAn off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving toxic and flammable substances at Equilon. The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified. Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\r\n\r\nThe following are summaries of the toxic and flammable WCS and ARS modeling at Equilon. All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 2.01 off-site consequence analysis program. Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the USEPA's and NOAA's MARPLOT Mapping Software, version 5.0.3. MARPLOT currently uses 2010 U.S. census data.\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\r\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators;\r\n- Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\r\n- Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\r\n\r\n1.

Bethune High School could be impacted by this release but the other schools in the area should be just outside of the impacted radius (endpoint distance).\r\n\r\n3. Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #2 - Hydrogen Sulfide\r\nAn alternative release scenario for hydrogen sulfide is the overfilling of the K-478 storage vessel spilling approximately 100,000 gallons of sour water over a conservatively estimated 10-minute time period. Multiple prevention measures are in place to mitigate or prevent this release from occurring and the actual pumping rate in the event of a release would be significantly lower than the modeled scenario. The overfilling (hydrogen sulfide toxic alternative-case scenario) results in a toxic endpoint distance of 1.9 miles (3.1 kilometers).\r\n\r\nMARPLOT was utilized to estimate the population impacted by this accidental release of hydrogen sulfide.
