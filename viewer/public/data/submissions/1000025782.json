This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature ratings, area electrical classification, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards.\r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, What-If, or PHA checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Facility Management Team.  Resolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility periodically updates and reva"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections/tests and documenting results, (4) preventive maintenance, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable operating limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity progr"

All operator training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force.  Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the Oil Storage Facility (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the Facility which are related to the contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the contractor selection process.  Also, facility personnel periodically monitor and evaluate contractor performance to verify that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations once onsite.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to confirm construction o"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, developing operating procedures and chemical information, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Oil Storage Facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and HOVENSA and contractor employee safety issues.  These initiatives are being developed by different teams to further promote both process and personal safety. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility keeps a variety of technical documents used to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Documents are maintained in the Facility Livelink system and are accessible by all employees.  (Specific departments within the Facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information).  \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) and HAZCOM lists.  The Facility ensures that each process is maintained within acceptable operating limits, by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automatic shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe Oil Storage Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of each process equipment. These documents are accessible on-lin"

The following types of general safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention/Containment/Control\r\n\r\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automatic)\r\n- Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n- Allow for partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release\r\n- Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., non-interruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\r\n \r\n Release Mitigation\r\n \r\n- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \r\n- Deluge system for specific equipment\r\n- Trained emergency response personnel\r\n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n- Equipment spacing that limits hazard exposure\r\n \r\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\n \r\nThe Facility investigates every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. \r\n\r\nHOVENSA has reported four releases in this five year accident history reporting period, all of which occurred prior to converting to an oil storage facility.  Three of the releases resulted in some offsite spotting from heavy oil which is not an RMP covered chemical.  Cleaning efforts of local property due to this heavy oil were reported as offsite property damage.  One other release resulted in a fire.  Damage due to this fire was reported as significant onsite property damage.  \r\n \r\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n \r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the envi"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. \r\n \r\nIn addition, the HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or changes involving facility personnel. The emergency response procedure changes are administered and include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n \r\nThe overall emergency response program for HOVENSA is handled by trained company personnel.  Although local agencies may assist with onsite emergency response, HOVENSA's ability to respond does not depend on such assistance.  \r\n\r\nThe HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility has 24-hour communication capabilities with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) officials and emergency response organizations, e.g., Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency (VITEMA).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The HOVENSA Oil Storage Facility conducts periodic emergency planning meetings that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and provides refresher training to LEPC regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facili"
