As part of this commitment we have established a system to promote the safe operation at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\r\nThe RMP at this facility consists of three (3) elements:\r\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the use of RMP regulated substances.\r\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a RMP regulated substance.\r\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\r\nThis facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards or controls against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage to its employees, the public and the environment.  We limit the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\r\nThe safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  There are other prevention programs that are company specific and those required by the Department of Transportation under parts 192 or 195 and OSHA under the PSM regulation.  The RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safet"

This facility implements reasonable prevention programs to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at this facility.\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, we control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  This facility coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response personnel.\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThis facility is primarily involved in the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream.  As part of this process, we handle several regulated, flammable substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  There are no such quantities of regulated toxic substances handled at the Plant.  The following RMP-regulated flammables are found at the Plant:\r\nEthane\r\nMethane\r\nPropane\r\nIso-Butane\r\nButane\r\nIso-Pentane\r\nPentane\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility uses a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, this prevention program for processing of natural gas was formalized to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements. Program 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.

PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION \r\nWe maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\r\n\ta) Physical properties of hazardous substances handled\r\nb) Operating parameters of the equipment- the engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes:\r\n\t\t1) Operating parameters \r\n\t\t2) Simplified process flow diagrams\r\n\t\t3) Maximum intended inventories\r\n4) Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, or flow\r\n\t\t5) Consequences of deviations from established operating limits \r\n\t\t6) Design basis and configuration of equipment\r\n\t\t7) Piping and instrument diagrams, including materials of construction\r\n\t\t8)  Electrical classification\r\n\t\t9) Safety systems \r\n\t\t10) Applicable design codes and standards\r\n\t\t11) Design basis for relief and, if applicable, ventilation systems\r\nc) Design basis and configuration of the equipment\r\nd) Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, including regulated substances in covered processes.  MSDS for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Plant's MSDS book so that personnel have ready reference to this information.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\r\n\t\t1) Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\r\n2) Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\r\n\t\t3) Reactivity and corrosivity data \r\n\t\t4) Thermal and chemical stability data\r\n\t\t5) Hazards of mixing substances in the process.\r\n3.

The What-If? / Checklist analysis technique is the primary tool used to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and company corporate management for resolution.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years.\r\n4. OPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nThis facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n5.

INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nIncidents are promptly investigated that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  The final resolution if each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retrained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\r\n12. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, this facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years.  Both Operations and Corporate staff personnel may participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe processes at this facilit"

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that the equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.  Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n9. SAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\nThis facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include; control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\r\n10. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\nA comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes has been developed for this facility.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Affected hazard information, process operating limits, and equipme"

We have safety features on many units to help; contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  Several safety features are utilized in the covered processes including:\r\n\ta) Release detection-Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, Release containment/control\r\nb) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n\tc) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\nd) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure and temperature)\r\ne) Release mitigation: Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.  Our employees are trained to fight small fires or initiate an ESD only\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe facility has had no accidents or incidents in covered process areas resulting in offsite effects.  The company's approach is to investigate incidents or events that could have reasonably resulted in an uncontrolled release of hazardous substances, to determine ways to prevent these events from recurring.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThis facility maintains a written emergency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies.  It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service.  The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\r\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions.  Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage.  Therefore, this plan is"

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  To ensure training is adequate and serves the safety of employees, operators are consulted with on the type and frequency of their training.\r\n6. CONTRACTORS\r\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\ta) perform their work in a safe manner\r\n\tb) have the appropriate knowledge and skills \r\n\tc) are aware of the hazards in their workplace\r\n\td) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n\te) understand and follow site safety rules\r\n\tf) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and their past performance before selection of a contractor is made.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n7. PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\r\nA PSSR is conducted at this facility for any major facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\n8.
