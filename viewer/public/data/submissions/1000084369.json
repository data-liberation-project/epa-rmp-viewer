The Coordinator, alternates, and all managers and supervisors have received training in response to non-hazardous emergencies and can evacuate the risk exposures. The responding coordinator will evaluate the scene to determine the risk exposures by assessing the type of chemical released and information provided on the Safety Data Sheet. If the release is of a non-hazardous nature, the release, confine and contain it to the immediate area to prevent further migration. If the released material is known to be hazardous or cannot be determined, all employees in the immediate vicinity are to leave the area immediately and notify the Emergency Coordinator and/or Alternate Coordinators.\r\n- Terminal Warehouse employees are not expected or trained to combat extremely hazardous\r\nreleases.\r\n- Depending on the applicability and the seriousness of the situation, the responding Coordinator\r\nwill:\r\n- Notify assigned team leaders of the emergency.\r\n- Evacuate the immediate area of the release and/or the entire facility should it be necessary.\r\n- Ensure supervisors account for all their employees at the Assembly Area.\r\n- Initiate calls to the appropriate agencies as needed i"
