      "SummaryText": "Blues City Brewery is a contract manufacturing of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. We plan on starting the facility up in July 2011.  The facility uses ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Use of ammonia is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112&reg;, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR , Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, the facility is considered to be a stationary source.  The regulated toxic chemical at the stationary source is ammonia.\n\n\n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan which form the basis of the RM program for the facility.  EPA's five key regulatory requirements for a RM program are:  \n\n\n\n1) Management Plan\n\n2) Hazard Assessment\n\n3) Accidental Release Prevention\n\n4) Emergency Response\n\n5) Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\n\n\n\nThis RM plan is based on the requirements listed above and is organized to reflect them in five sections, as summarized below;\n\n\n\nRequirement 1. Management Plan\n\nThe RM Program Manager for BCB reports to the Plant Manager who, in turn reports to the President of the company. Utility supervisors, maintenance supervisor, operators, engineers, and staff level personal also execute component activities to maintain compliance with RM regulations. At the Memphis plant, individuals have been assigned responsibility for all five requirements of the RM program, including management, hazard assessment, prevention, emergency planning and RM plan updates.\n\n\n\nReguirement 2 Hazard Assessment\n\nPotenial accidental releases of ammonia were modeled to evaluate possible offsite impacts. Modeling procedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case release scenarios (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations. EPA personnel freely admit that the assumptions esed for WCS are "

      "SummaryText": "not realistic and in some cases are not physially possible. However, EPA guidance was followed and toxic and flammable endpoints were identifed. The WCSs were identified by comparing the results for each ammonia or chlorine system and selesting the scenario the resulted in the greatest distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint. The number of offsite permanent residents located inside a circle ( centered on the release point with a radius equal to the endpoint) was then estimated using EPA's Landview III software ( Version 1.0). The offsite population estimates do not include 80 BCB employees at the Memphis plant. RM Regulations require reporting of a WCS and ACS for each regulated process that could impact different offsite population.\n\n\n\nA release of 17,500 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes was idenified as the WCS for the ammonia refrigeration process. The WCS would produce a toxic endpoint ( defined as 200 parts per million [ppm] ammonia) of 2.4 miles. An estimated offsite population of 35,000 is located within this radius.\n\n\n\nTo develop more realistic estimates of offsite impacts, as required by RM regulations, several ACS were evaluted for the ammonia refrigeration system. The ACS selected for presentation in this document and for reporting to EPA was selected based on industry recommendations and likeihood of occurrence. The selected ACS consits of a 3/4- inch Schedule 80 pipe failure, which contains liquid ammonia under pressure. This results in an endpoint distance of 0.65 miles. An estimated offsite popualtion of 260 is located within this radius.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, none of the processes subject to RM regulations have had releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases or fire.\n\n\n\nRequirement 3. Prevention Program\n\nThe Memphis facility has a chemical release prevention program for ammonia. The prevention programs for the ammonia process were developed to comply w"

EPA requires a program 3 prevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0:\n\n\n\n-Employee Participation\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Contractors\n\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n-Training\n\n-Mechanical Integrity\n\n-Hot Work Permit\n\n-Management Change\n\n-Incident Investigation\n\n-Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nRequirements 4. Emergency Response\n\nLocal agency in which our facility's ER plan or response activities are coordinated with would be the Memphis Fire Department.The emergency response program at the facility is initianted by BCB personal who are all trained to recognize ammonia releases and immediatley inform the Safety Department. Ammonia gas sensors/alarms are present at five locations that automatically trigger audible alarms and alert the Safety Department if ammonia is detected. Employees contact the Safety Department using radio contact since channel #1 is maintained for this purpose 24 hours per day. BCB personnel not carrying radios who notice a release are to clear the area immediately and notify their supervisor, or others who carry radios so they can inform the Safety Department.\n\n\n\nThe Safety Department has nine (Incident Command Level) trained individuals (at least one is onsite) who are sent to the scene to assess the situation and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment. When external emergency responders arrive, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdication (AHJ), and supported by the Safety Department, and BCB personnel who know the affected process well. The AHJ will initally be the City of Memphis Fire Department. The AHJ can ca"
