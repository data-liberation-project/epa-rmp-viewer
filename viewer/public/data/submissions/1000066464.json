Each of the storage tanks are pressure vessels and are permitted by the same regulatory agency.\r\n\r\nAll tanks, pumps, piping, fittings, valves and associated safety devices are installed and maintained following NFPA-58 Code requirements and National LP Gas Association guide lines. We have excess flow and check valves in lines, as well as manual and automatic shut off valves.  The tanks are equipped with an excess flow valve and pressure relief valve.  We have maintenance procedures that prevent corrosion.  Storage tanks are typically filled to 85% of full capacity as a matter of internal policy to maintain a margin of safety.\r\n\r\nShield has written operating procedures for safe unloading and handling of chemicals and gases.  All bulk liquid chemicals are stored in diked containment areas.  These containment areas have manual drain valves. All valves on all tanks are closed when not in use. \r\n\r\nShield has a robust preventive maintenance program that insures that the tanks and handling equipment remain in safe working condition.

Employees shall remain in the designated assembly area until instructed to return to their work stations by the Plant Manager or designee.  If a discharge cannot be controlled, or in the event of a fire, the Fire Department will be summoned immediately and all other required regulatory agencies will be notified.
