The facility receives flammable gases, liquefied under pressure, by tank truck and places them in storage tanks. These flammable gases are used as ingredients in our products.\n\n\n\nDetails of storage tanks are as follows:\n\nTank No. 1:  Volume: 6,900 USG;  Content:  A-70 blend [54.7% Propane, 27.2% N-Butane, 18.1% Isobutane]\n\nTank No. 2:  Volume: 5,500 USG;  Content: A-46 blend [19.1% Propane, 80.9% Isobutane]\n\nTank No. 10:  Volume:  6,000 USG;  Content: Difluoroethane [R152a]\n\nTank No. 8:  Volume:  3,275 USG;  Content:  Dimethyl Ether [also known as Methyl Ether]\n\n\n\nThe unloading manifolds are adequately designed and approved by the CAL OSHA Pressure Vessel Division.  Each of the storage tanks are pressure vessels and are permitted by the same regulatory agency.\n\n\n\nAll tanks, pumps, piping, fittings, valves and associated safety devices are installed and maintained following NFPA-58 Code requirements and National LP Gas Association guide lines. We have excess flow and check valves in lines, as well as manual and automatic shut off valves.  The tanks are equipped with an excess flow valve and pressure relief valve.  We have maintenance procedures that prevent corrosion.  Storage tanks are typically filled to 85% of full capacity as a matter of internal policy to maintain a margin of safety.\n\n\n\nShield has written operating procedures for safe unloading and handling of chemicals and gases.  All bulk liquid chemicals are stored in diked containment areas.  These containment areas have manual drain valves. All valves on all tanks are closed when not in use. \n\n\n\nShield has a robust preventive maintenance program that insures that the tanks and handling equipment remain in safe working condition. The employees are well trained to perform their particular job tasks in a safe and competent manner.\n\n\n\nShield is a non-responding facility.

The Fire Department conducts periodic walk through of the entire facility.  This enables them to prepare for adequate emergency response. Anticipated response time is short as the fire station is located less than a half mile away.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan outlines the necessary actions in the event of emergency scenarios.  If the emergency evacuation alarm is sounded, certain designated employees have pre-assigned duties while all other employees evacuate along a pre-determined route and gather at an assembly area.  Employees shall remain in the designated assembly area until instructed to return to their work stations by the Plant Manager or designee.  If a discharge cannot be controlled, or in the event of a fire, the Fire Department will be summoned immediately and all other required regulatory agencies will be notified.  We have made arrangements with an outside contractor to help with emergency response, if necessary.  Shield conducts periodic drills to maintain the necessary level of preparedness.\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred at the Shield facility which is also secured by a fence.\n\n\n\nOur Worst Case scenario would be a vapor cloud explosion, resulting from a storage tank rupture due to overfilling and/or equipment failure.  \n\nThe Alternative Release scenario consists of a truck pull away during unloading, with the release of the contents of a 2 inches diameter, 20 feet long hose, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nThe USEPA's RMP Comp model has been used to estimate the distance to endpoints.\n\nThe Worst Case scenario for a vapor cloud explosion of the A-70 blend, is a distance to endpoint of 0.3 mile.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario, resulting from a truck pull away/hose failure and a vapor cloud explosion of pure propane or isobutane, is a distance to endpoint of 0.01 mile.\n\n\n\nMARPLOT (Mapping Application "
