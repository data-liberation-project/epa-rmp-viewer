LP (Devon), owner and operator of the Worland Gas Plant (Plant), has a long-standing commitment to safety. This commitment is demonstrated through the resources invested towards accident prevention and through the consideration of public and environmental safety during the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes. Devon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe Plant is a cryogenic expander plant used to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas. Regulated substances stored onsite in volumes above the regulatory threshold include pipeline quality natural gas (methane) and natural gas liquids comprised of ethane, propane, butane, condensate (pentane) and heavier hydrocarbons; some of which are regulated flammable substances. An inventory of equipment and regulated substances was developed from the stored chemical inventory and volumes of vessels and piping from the Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs). Because vessels and interconnecting piping fit the EPA's definition of stationary sources and contain more than the threshold quantities of regulated flammable substances, the Plant is subject to CFR Title 40, Part 68 regulations.\n\n\n\nBecause the Plant processes that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the accident prevention program for the Plant addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. Specialized safety features at the Plant help quickly detect a release, contain/control the release, and mi"

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\n\n\nThe Plant has had no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years. Because of its safe working history, the Plant has no planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
