      "SummaryText": "Since Hawkins Inc. was founded in 1938, the company has become a critical source of chemical products for communities and businesses across the upper midwest.  For example, nearly all municipal and industrial water treatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for water disinfectants and other treatment products, equipment and expertise.\r\n\r\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota with branches that meet local needs in seven neighboring states.  The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.\r\n\r\nHawkins has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan for its Washburn facility where its primary activity is to receive and distribute packaged products such as chlorine for use by individual customer facilities.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan that Hawkins staff has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool; it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others.  Risk Management Plans are developed by facilities that have sufficient quantities of any 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle two of these materials.  In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that 150,000 Risk Management Plans have been submitted since the original June 1999 due date.\r\n\r\nThe products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  Chlorine and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) are well-known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, waste water, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc. Sulfur Dioxide is used primarily as for dechlorination of waste water prior to discharge.\r\n\r\nRisk Management\r\nHawkins provides products critical to meeting the region's public health and the manufacturing needs.  Some of these products pose risks, which is why all Hawkins employees share a commitment to safety.  Our safety policy states:\r\nHawkins Inc. recognizes"

The company has provided and will continue to provide, the human, physical and financial resources necessary to meet this objective.  We expect all enployees of the company to use these resources to make our operations as safe and healthful as humanly possible.\r\n\r\nPlanning for accidents, such as that done through RMP, helps to ensure that they never happen.  In fact, our RMP for Washburn, ND reports no harmful accidental releases over the reportable period of five years.  Hawkins Inc. is a leader in national efforts to ensure safe handling of chemicals such as chlorine and sulfur dioxide\r\n\r\nReality is, however that accidents can happen.  That's why we continually update mechanical safeguards and invest heavily in training for our employees and our customers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our internal efforts, safety and emergency response planning also is coordinated with local and national officical, including the Washburn Fire Department."
