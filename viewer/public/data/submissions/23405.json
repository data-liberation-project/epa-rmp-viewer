Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with JACKSONVILLE  FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), and Aqua Ammonia. The Sulfur Dioxide, Aqua Ammonia  and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Aqua Ammonia  are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 57,450 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and Aqua Ammonia are present at our facility in quantities of 28,700 lbs.,  and 21,375 lbs. respectively.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as SAFER/TRACE and RMP COMP VER. 1.06. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst"

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.20 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 150 lb. SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 1.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Aqua Ammonia involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 2,480 lb. of Aqua Ammonia  in a liquid form over 4 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  0.14 mg/l. \n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program th"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     ?WHAT IF?  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.
