Executive Summary\r\nThis document has been prepared to demonstrate how Supreme Oil, complies with the requirements set forth under EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nIt specifically addresses the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at Supreme Oil.  The following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  This summary provides a cross-reference to the applicable existing documentation.  \r\n\r\n1.1.\tCommitment to Safety\r\nSupreme Oil is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards. Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\r\n\r\n1.1.1.\tIt is the policy of Supreme Oil to: \r\n1.1.1.1.\tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\r\n1.1.1.2.\tComply with all federal, state, and local occupational Health and Safety laws and regulations.\r\n1.1.1.3.\tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\r\n1.1.1.4.\tEnsure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work in a safe manner.  Educate and/or train all employees in safe work practices, and ensures that each employee fully understands his or her job, equipment, techniques, and methods to reduce the risk to himself or herself and their co-workers.\r\n1.1.2.\tEncourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\r\n1.1.3.\tThis facility's aim is to provide a professio"

In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/ or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service. Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\r\n1.1.4.\tSupreme Oil has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process. It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\r\n1.1.5.\tThe first duty of Supreme Oil employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/her, co-workers, the general public or equipment. Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization. \r\n\r\n1.2.\tFacility Description\r\nSupreme Oil is an edible oils, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and condiments processing facility; where food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, packaged and boxed for shipment to end users. There are approximately 130 employees working at the facility.\r\n1.2.1.\tThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n1.2.2.\tAnhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System\".  Approximately 13,800 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, cooling units, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the Process System.
