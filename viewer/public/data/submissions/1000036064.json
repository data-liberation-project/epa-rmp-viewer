All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and action procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nMidwest Cold Storage based in Wisconsin Rapids, WI is primarily a cold storage warehouse. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Midwest Cold Storage has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \n\n\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Midwest Cold Storage facility.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Rapids facility has an emergency plan that addresses the actions necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors and visual alarms. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators and contractors have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the appropriate agencies to assist in the response. "

Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA release occurred on 4/9/2013 that is listed in the 5 year accident history section of the RMP.  This incident did not result in any on or offsite injuries or evacuations.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis storage facility has procedures in place to act defensively to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the Wood County Emergency Management/LEPC, the Wisconsin Rapids Fire Department, and others is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMidwest Cold Storage expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the most recent Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Midwest Cold Storage expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
