If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Hartford, VT Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We do not have an on site fire brigade.  Our on site employees are trained to fight incipient-stage fires only and than evacuate and assist the local fire department with propane technical knowledge and assistance.\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG primarily for distribution directly to our retail customers via bobtail delivery.  A portion of the product from this site is distributed to our network of smaller company owned terminals via transport loads. The facility consists of one 60,000 gallon tank and is serviced by multiple 30,000 gallon railroad cars, staged on New England Central Railroad property, awaiting offload.\n\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 60,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%at 60F), resulting in a vapor clould explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 3-inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nWe have never had an incident at this location involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property damage or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn"

We also have trained Propane Emergency Responders within our company that can provide technical assistance to the Incident Commander.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system and we will invite them to conduct a joint exercise with us.\n\n\n\nWe have also implemented housekeeping standards and a new training competency outline for all operators of the facility.  In addition, the stairway to the main propane loading tower has been modified (stars widened) to improve access and the guardrails and crash bollards have been relocated to provide greater crash protection at the site.\n\n"
