Box 106, Hornick, Iowa 51026\nFor Locations at:\nBlencoe, Correctionville, Hornick, Mapleton, Pierson, Turin, Washta,\n\nExecute Summary\n\n1. Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) varies by location:\nHornick, Iowa, Location.    \n Nurse tank filling site\n Nurse Tanks  \n\nTank for liquid mix plant - has been discontinued 10-4-04\n         \n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n\na. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  \n\nb.     The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach and aend point off-site.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n    \nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OAHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia sy"

      "SummaryText": "stems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regualr basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  LIquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines in the ANSI Standards.  \n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually,  whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.   The trainig consists of classroom lecture, current videos, and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training include; safety, operating procedured for plant startup, plant shutdowns, filing a nurse tank, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shudow\n\n5.        The Five Year Accident History\n\nAt the Hornick Location, no accidental releases have occurred.\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program.    \n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all the local response agencies by providing infromation and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our faciliity.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.\n\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Western Iowa Coop.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional new specific anhydrous ammonia  recommendations for the nurse tank filliing site. \n\n\nCertification\n\nI certify to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the inform"
