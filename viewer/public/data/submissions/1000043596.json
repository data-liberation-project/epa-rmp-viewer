Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1983.\r\n\r\nOur corporate Environmental, Safety and Health policies and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, its employees and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences, of significant releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.

Anheuser-Busch employees, whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health, are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policies.\r\n\r\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics and policies similar to our own, and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\r\n\r\nWe encourage our employees, customers and the public to share with us their environmental concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\r\n\r\nAmmonia System\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, our products are cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it is shipped.  Because of the characteristics of ammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nAnheuser-Busch has years of experience operating ammonia-based refrigeration system"

We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain an \"Emergency Response Plan\" (ERP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Belgium-Cold Springs Fire and Rescue Department and the Onondaga County LEPC.  We conduct annual meetings on site with local agencies to help us remain prepared to implement the ERP at the brewery.  \r\n\r\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.
