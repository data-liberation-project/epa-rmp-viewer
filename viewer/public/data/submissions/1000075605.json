The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nThe Jackson County Utility Authority's Emergency Response Plan is used to provide clear, concise directions during an emergency.  Its function is to prevent physical harm to the staff, the public, or the plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThis plan is a key to preparedness and was developed using EPA guidelines.  The Emergency Response Plan includes a series of action plans for specific situations and lists emergency supplies, emergency organizations, and emergency telephone numbers.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is comprised of the following action plans for emergency situations:\n\n\n\n*  Emergency Telephone Numbers\n\n*  First Aid Procedures\n\n*  Chemical Emergencies\n\n*  Electrical Emergencies\n\n*  Weather Emergencies\n\n*  Material Safety Data Sheets\n\n\n\nInsofar as possible, every contingency has been covered under the Authority's Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Authority's wastewater treatment facilities have safety systems for the prevention of an accidental release.  These systems include the following:\n\n\n\n*  Leak Detector System\n\n*  Automatic Emergency Shut Off System\n\n*  Manual Shut off System\n\n*  Call-Out System\n\n*  Safety Inspections\n\n\n\nThe leak detector system monitors the chlorine/sulfur dioxide storage area and the feed control station for chemical leaks.  In the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, the leak detector will activate an audible alarm horn and warning light signifying the type of leak, chlorine or sulfur dioxide and the leak location.  The Automatic Emergency Shut Off System operates an automatic valve shutoff actuator that will shut down the gas system upon leak detection.  In addition to the automatic shut off and audible alarm, the alarm system will activate and alert plant personnel or the call- out man via the plant's automatic dialing alarm system (ADAS).  Responding personnel then implement the Emergency Response Plan and follow the pertine"

These inspections are conducted on a semi-annual basis.  The inspections are reviewed by each department head and any safety infraction is corrected.  The safety inspection insures that a safe working environment is maintained at all times.\n\n\n\nWith the use of these safety systems, the Authority provides safety of not only plant personnel but, the community around the facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nThe JCUA POTW 1C treatment plant treats domestic wastewater from the city of Ocean Springs and the West Jackson County Utility District.\n\n\n\nChlorine is applied to the treatment plant effluent for the purpose of disinfection and sulfur dioxide is used for chlorine removal prior to discharge to the Bayou Costapia.\n\n\n\nThe facility stores two one-ton containers of chlorine and two one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  This equates to a six-month supply of chlorine and an eight-month supply of sulfur dioxide at present operating conditions.  The facility operates with one container of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on line and one container of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on standby.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10-minute release time.\n\n\n\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, class F stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0087 at a distance of 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe residential population within this distance is 4,428.  Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include residences, recreational areas, federal wilderness and wildlife refuge.\n\n\n\nAlternate-case re"

Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include a federal wilderness and wildlife refuge.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is completely enclosed and ventilated.  This minimizes the potential for overheating of the ton container.\n\n\n\nThe gas feeder on the chlorine container is designed to shut off the supply of gas in case of a line breakage.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is also equipped with a leak detector system.  In the event of a leak, the alarm will activate, alerting the plant personnel.  This provides for immediate response to a leak by plant personnel.\n\n\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": " the Emergency Response Plan. \n\n\n\nThe safety inspections are conducted by the Authority's Safety Committee on a semi-annual basis for overall plant safety and awareness.  Plant operators conduct monthly safety inspections on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems to insure all equipment is in property working condition.  Any discrepancies found during the inspections are corrected immediately. \n\n\n\nWith the use of these safety system, the Authority provides safety of not only plant personnel, but the surrounding community as well.  \n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nThe West Jackson County Regional Wastewater Treatment plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide over the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe Authority participates in the Community Right to Know, SARA Title III, Tier 2 program. The JCUA participates in the EPlan Hazmat Emergency Response system online reporting notified by Tier II reporting system that is required by the EPA. E-Plan is a proven system that provides First Responders and others with on-site hazardous chemical information for facilities around the United States. It utilizes emergency contact and hazardous material information submitted under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations and sends it via the Internet to First Responders just when they need it the most.   This information is also provided to the Jackson County Office of Emergency Services.\n\n\n\n7.  Safety Improvements.\n\n\n\nThe Automatic Emergency Shut Off System was installed in 2018. The Authority installed a new chlorination and de-chlorination system in December 2002.  Along with the new system, chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors were installed for monitoring of chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks.  In 2005, the storage building was enclosed for security."
