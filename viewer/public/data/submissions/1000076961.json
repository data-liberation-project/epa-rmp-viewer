Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  SpartanNash - Landover Distribution Center has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nSpartanNash - Landover Distribution Center has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nSpartanNash - Landover Distribution Center has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes aspects of emergency response such as evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. Chaple Oaks Fire Station #38 is the agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our in-house First Responders are trained to take defensive action in correcting, minimizing and mitigating emergency situations. Under no circumstances will our in-house First Responders remain in a hazardous atmosphere beyond the acceptable limits of their safety equipment. For emergency situations, we are also coordinated with  Chaple Oaks Fire Station #38 which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around food storage and distribution.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\r\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA RMP*COMP as well as the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Se"

The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, SpartanNash - Landover Distribution Center maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\n- Training\r\nSpartanNash - Landover Distribution Center has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.
