              "Description": "The ADM Glycols facility (1000060629) is located within the ADM Decatur Complex and produces hydrogen by the steam reforming of desulfurized natural gas. Hydrogen is purified and stored in a low pressure storage tank before it is sent to compressors. Low pressure hydrogen is also piped to the Corn Plant (1000060744 and 1000059961) low pressure storage tank.  High pressure hydrogen is stored in high pressure storage tanks and is piped from these tanks to the glycols production area.  High pressure hydrogen is also piped to the Corn Plant (1000060744 and 1000059961) high pressure storage tanks. Hydrogen enters the hydrogen discharge pipe header which is connected to two reactor trains in which it reacts with glycerin over a catalyst to produce glycols. The Glycols facility (1000060629) has a hazard prevention program for the process.  The facility?s program is a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program which addresses the Prevention Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR ?68.175. The program covers hydrogenolysis, hydrogen production, compression, and storage. All safeguards described in this section (e.g., process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring/detection systems) apply to the hydrogen systems at the Glycols Plant.\n\n\n\nPlant Manager: Cameron Bagley\n\nDate of Emergency Response Plan Review/Update: 2/28/2017\n\nDate of Emergency Response Plan Training for employees: 6/28/2017\n\nLast Safety Inspection by External Agency: 11/9/2017\n\nName of Agency: State Fire Marshall",

The Vitamin E facility (1000060745) then uses compressors to increase the hydrogen pressure to high pressure. The high pressure hydrogen is piped to four reactors in which it reacts with the non-alpha tocopherol to produce alpha tocopherol. The Vitamin E facility (1000060745) has a Process Safety Management (PSM) program which address the Prevention Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR ?68.175. The program covers reactor operation, hydrogen compression, and storage. All safeguards described in this section (e.g., process controls, mitigation systems, monitoring/detection system) apply to the hydrogen system at the Vitamin E facility (1000060745).\n\n\n\nPlant Manager: Matt Philips\n\nDate of Emergency Response Plan Review/Update: 12/22/2014\n\nDate of Emergency Response Plan Training for employees: 12/16/2014\n\nLast Safety Inspection by External Agency: 12/16/2014\n\nName of Agency: Global Risk\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for the ADM Decatur Complex.    The Decatur Complex is an industrial complex with contiguous and adjacent facilities consisting of an East Complex and a West Complex, as well as additional support facilities.  The following locations are covered by this RMP:  Corn Processing, BioProducts, East Plant, Glycols, and Cogeneration within the East Complex and Vitamin E and West Refinery within the West Complex.\n\n Each listed location employs chemical specific safety precautions in handling hazardous chemicals to reduce the threat to worker, members of the community and the environment.  Emergency response for the ADM Decatur Complex is coordinated with ADM Personnel and the Decatur Fire Department.   Each location has its own emergency response plan and prevention program.  In addition, within the response plans, each location has developed chemical specific response strategies applicable to their location. The plans also include procedures for notifying the appropriate personnel and agencies in the event of an accident involving a hazardous chemical.  The Emergency Response Plan review and training dates listed in Section 9 of this RMP are based upon activities at the Corn Processing facility, as it is the largest facility within the complex and has two covered processes.\n\n\n\nThis plan addresses the following three chemicals: \n\n1.    Anhydrous Ammonia -   BioProducts, Cogeneration, and West Refinery \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail and stored in three storage tanks.  At the BioProducts facility, anhydrous ammonia is used as a pH control and a nitrogen source for product fermentation.  At the ADM Cogeneration facility, anhydrous ammonia is utilized to reduce emissions of nitrous oxides.  The West Refinery receives anhydrous ammonia by truck where it is stored in tanks, vessels and piping as a refrigerant in its dry condensing system.\n\n2.    Pentane - Corn Processing, \n\n\"Natural Gasoline\" containing pentanes (n-pe"

      "SummaryText": "ntane and iso-pentane, both a \"flammable chemical\") is used to denature ethyl alcohol prior to being stored for load-out.  \n\n3.    Hydrogen - Corn Processing, Glycols, West Plant and Vitamin E\n\nHydrogen is produced at the Glycols and West Refinery plants. It is used at Glycols to produce propylene glycol. It is used at the West Refinery to hydrogenate vegetable oil. The Corn Processing facility utilizes hydrogen to produce sorbitol. The Vitamin E Plant uses hydrogen to produce Alpha tocopherol from non-Alpha tocopherols. All plants store hydrogen. Glycols, Corn Processing, and Vitamin E use compressors to increase the pressure of hydrogen which is required for each of their processes, respectively. The Corn Plant and Glycols share a low pressure hydrogen pipeline between locations and as well as a high pressure pipeline.\n\nThe Prevention Program Descriptions for each covered process provide information related to the prevention program details, emergency response plan reviews and training at the specified location.  The key concepts of ADM's prevention programs are the elements of each location's site specific Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Each location's emergency response plans are coordinated with ADM personnel and/or the Decatur Fire Department such that, in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implements.  ADM works cooperatively with the Decatur Fire Department to improve response capabilities.  \n\nIn the past five years, the ADM facilities listed above have not experienced any accidents involving the referenced covered processes that have required reporting under this standard.  \n\nADM personnel focus on safety on a daily basis.  General safety planning and improvement programs are also in place through various safety committees and management activities at each location.  The locations continue to evaluate options for improving processes and efficiencies in order to reduce the quantities of hazardous materials used and "
