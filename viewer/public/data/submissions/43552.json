The Plant is located at 13101 Leopard St., in the northwestern part of Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas.  The Plant provides approximately 70 million gallons of drinking water per day, during the winter months, and 100 million gallons per day, in summer.  The City of Corpus Christi has a commitment to safely providing drinking water to this region.\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only regulated chemical used in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is used as an ingredient to kill the pathogens in the water and to make the water safe to drink.  Because of the enormous amount of water that has to be treated, a large quantity of chlorine must be kept at this site for use.  There are other chemicals that are used in the treatment of the water, but the other chemicals are stored and used in smaller quantities, making them exempt from the Risk Management Plan regulations.  Safety is of utmost importance, when working with and around any of the chemicals in the Plant.\n\n\n\nThe ONSWTP has been using chlorine for more than 45 years, and there are no reportable incidents of chlorine releases.  The excellent track record is founded in the methods used to deliver the chlorine into the water.\n\n\n\nDuring the process, chlorine is normally stored under pressure as a liquid in two 90-ton rail tank cars.  Even though the 90-ton storage containers are designed to travel on rails and designed to take impacts at high rates of speed, at the Plant, these containers are stationary and are anchored in place during the delivery of chlorine to the process.  Liquid chlorine rail tank cars are near the evaporators, reducing the length of pipe containing liquid chlorine, reduces the hazard, because liquid chlorine has a higher risk potential than chlorine gas.  From the evaporators, the chlorine gas is transported to the chlorine injection points under a "

These cylinders are normally not kept at the Plant.  If problems should arise in the normal chlorination process, the one-ton cylinders will be ordered, delivered, and used as needed.\n\n\n\nAll of the projects that are performed at the Plant are implemented with safety at the forefront.  Competent and knowledgeable engineers design the plans, and the materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.  Rail tank cars are equipped with excess flow valves, which will shut off the flow of chlorine should a pipe in the system sever completely, and the system is designed with proper safety relief valves as needed.  In addition, a remote actuated shut-off valve is located in the unloading line at the point the ONSWTP system is entered near the top of the tank car.  Area gas monitors are used to detect any leaks, and video cameras are used for remote early detection.\n\n\n\nDuring the design phase, special consideration is given to safety by reviewing chlorine process changes.  A team has been created to perform a Hazard Review of all projects that involve significant changes.  This team is composed of employees who are experts in different areas of the plant functions, thus evaluating all of the aspects of safety that may be affected.  The hazard review can be very detailed and intricate, if new systems are being introduced or major changes are occurring; or they can be more relaxed, if minor changes are being made.  In either case, the Process Optimizer will evaluate all of the projects for hazard review requirements before they are bid for construction.  Reviewing every change that occurs in the chlorine system increases the level of safety for the community.\n\n\n\nSome of the technological equipment that is in place includes a Supervisory Control Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, an operator ac"

The SCADA system is a computerized system that administratively controls the chlorine process and controls equipment that is used to treat and distribute to water throughout the community.  Many of the chlorine system's alarms is connected to the SCADA, and early detection is acquired.  Hooking up to the SCADA allows the operations personnel to give an early warning and to take steps to stop a release within a reasonable time after a release occurs.  Time is of essence in an emergency, and this system provides the capability of detecting problems early.  Operator actuated alarms allow early warning to Plant personnel of any emergency, should it occur.  The video monitoring system acts both as a security measure and as a measure for early detection and location.  Remote monitoring of the chlorine system allows operations \n\npersonnel to detect the presence of unauthorized personnel at the facility and the location of a release, should it occur.\n\n\n\nA water spray mitigation system has been installed.  This system has the capability of creating a water curtain on either side of the tank car and diverting the runoff to an underground holding tank.  This is an active system, requiring human intervention. The holding tank is designed to contain the chlorine near the rail car, should a release occur.  The tank has sufficient capacity, so that the operators will have the time needed to stop the release without the tank spilling over.  Design allows for chlorine to be captured and neutralized as required, after the incident is over.\n\n\n\nA Security Guard is posted at the entrance to the facility.  The purpose of the guard is to keep unauthorized personnel out of the Plant and to document who is in the Plant during an emergency, should one occur.\n\n\n\nTraining is an important part of chlorine safety.

Refresher training is an integral part of the program, along with hands on application exercises.  Qualified personnel are used to train the employees in all areas of their job, which impact the chlorine process.\n\n\n\nAll of the Plant personnel are trained in the performance of their duties.  Multi-Skilled Technicians are trained to operate the chlorine process in a safe manner.  They are required to be licensed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. (TCEQ), and they are required to follow internal operating procedures regarding operations of the chlorine system.  Multi-Skilled Technicians are also trained to work on the Chlorine Institute guidelines.  Preventative maintenance on all equipment and materials is also performed in a timely manner, in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuditing safety methods and procedures is a very important part of the safety program at the Treatment Plant.  During the course of the workday, each employee is watchful for possible improvements, and there are specified procedures for employee suggestions to be considered for implementation.  Inspections of the materials and equipment are conducted twice a year, or sooner if the preventative maintenance requires more frequent inspections.  Every three years, the Water Department or an independent consultant will perform a complete safety inspection of the chlorine system, to determine any safety improvements that can be made to the system.\n\n\n\nAll serious incidents shall be thoroughly investigated.
