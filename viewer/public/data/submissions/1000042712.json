      "SummaryText": "Dalton Utilities' Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorine Handling at the Land Application System involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction. \n\n\n\nThe Dalton Land Application System (LAS) is contained within a 9000-acre site bounded on three sides by the Conasauga River.  The site is fenced and public access is controlled.  The site consists of primarily forested land and most of the bordering property is forested, much of it in commercial timber production.  \n\n\n\nThe LAS utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated effluent from its three-wastewater treatment plants prior to land application.  The chlorine is introduced at Pump Stations B and C.  These pump stations have similar configurations and pump the disinfected wastewater out to the individual spray fields via a pipeline distribution system for spray irrigation. The chlorination process is identical at Pump Stations B and C and includes chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.  Chlorination for disinfection of treated wastewater is not part of the SIC codes listed by EPA in 68.10(d), and the municipal facility is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Consequently, this qualifies the LAS chlorination process as a Program 2 process.\n\n\n\nFor each chlorination process, accidental release modeling was been performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in an accidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case\" scenario, defined by EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over a 10 minut"

      "SummaryText": "e period.  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\n\n\nIn each accidental release modeling case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed with the use of the US EPA's RMP*COMP software application to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreased to a theoretical level of no effect.  This is level is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the no effect level distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.  The use of US EPA's CAMEO. MARPLOT, and ALOHA software applications were also used in determining the affected population during a release.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenarios were determined for each of the two pump stations.  Though unlikely, the worst-case release scenario would possibly result from a 2,000 \n\npound loss of liquid chlorine due to the failure of a faulty packing nut on the cylinder valve stem assembly.  For each pump station, a no effect distance of 3.0 miles was obtained for the described worst-case release scenario.    \n\n\n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for the chlorination process at each pump station involves the mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection (pigtail) allowing an accidental release from one ton cylinder of chlorine over a ten minute period, at which time the failure is repaired.  Under these conditions, similar atmospheric modeling was performed with the RMP*COMP software.  For each pump station, a release radius of less than 0.2 miles was obtained.  Within this radius, any impact to residential population is highly improbable due to the lack of any nearby residents. \n\n\n\nThe Dalton Utilities' Risk Man"
