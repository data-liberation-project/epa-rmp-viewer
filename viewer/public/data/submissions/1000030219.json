This RMP Submittal is intended to comply with the regulatory requirement for information updates every 5 years. \r\n\r\nThe process at AESPR uses chlorine gas stored in up to thirteen 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for bacteria in water, for odor and biological growth control.  This is necessary in order to prevent corrosion, sedimentation and fouling of the cooling water system.  Hyper chlorinated water is applied directly to the water in the cooling tower basin and to the make-up water treatment system for plant service water and boiler steam and water cycle make-up.  \r\n\r\nAESPR provides chlorine treatment to about 6 million gallons per day of make-up water to a daily average concentration of 20 mg/L. Chlorine is delivered to AESPR via truck in 1-ton (2,000 pounds) containers, which are used onsite as storage vessels.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Facility is 26,000 pounds, in thirteen 1-ton containers.  At the station three (3) of the 1-ton containers are connected manually with a flexible hose connection and vacuum regulator attached directly to the containers.  The vacuum regulators are designed to act as a safety shutoff in the event of a loss of vacuum due to a piping leak or malfunction of the ejectors.  As vacuum decreases, the vacuum regulator closes to reduce or shutoff the flow of chlorine.  \r\n\r\nThe potential release of the content of one container would not affect the release of the other containers in the same location.  \r\nAt the chlorine gas station, the gas is delivered under vacuum to ejectors located in the same gas station.  The ejectors combine the gaseous chlorine with water.\r\n\r\nChlorine leak detectors have been installed in the vecinity of the station to de"
