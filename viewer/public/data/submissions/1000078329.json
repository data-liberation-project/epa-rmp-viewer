Burnett & Co. is committed to the goal of preventing the occurrence of chemical spills of either hazardous or non-hazardous materials. To this end, Wm. T. Burnett & Co has developed procedures and will  take measures intended to prevent spills and to provide an adequate emergency response in the event of a spill. To date, no external accidental releases have occurred at this facility.\n\n     Engineered systems are installed on all bulk chemical handling equipment. This is supplemented with job safety procedures and employee training in spill prevention and cleanup.\n\n     A Facility Emergency Plan is in place and specifies a facility emergency coordinator who is assigned to interface with all outside emergency responders. The Risk Management Plan, the Facility Emergency Plan, and safety procedures will be updated periodically.\n\n     The Emergency Response Plan for this facility is coordinated with the (Anne Arundel County) Local Emergency Response Committee.\n\n\n\n     Description of Stationary Sources:\n\n     This Facility manufactures both polyether and polyester urethane foams. This is done by the reaction of a polyether or a polylester polyol with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and water. Various amine activators blends and surfactants are used to stabilize and control the reaction rates.  This process may occur on either of two production machines or on a laboratory scale pilot machine. All foaming machines are vented to the environment through air scrubbing devices.\n\n     This facility receives, stores and processes mixed isomers of TDI in quantities referred to in 40 CFR 68.115. The greatest amount of TDI held in a single vessel involves receiving and unloading from railcars on a private rail siding. A rail car containment dike at the siding is in place to capture the contents of a single vessel spill and limits the puddle  so there are no off site consequences to a spill. After unloading, the TDI is stored in severa"

The storage tanks within the facility are vented to the environment through air scrubbing devices.\n\n\n\n     Worst-case Scenario:     \n\n     The worst-case release scenario analyzed for this facility was the loss of the entire contents of a fully loaded railcar of TDI. This would occur on the siding next to the facility where a dike has been constructed to receive and contain the entire content of a single railcar. This will limit the  of any puddle that would occur. An analysis of the other storage tanks inside the facility was also done. These tanks are 1) significantly smaller than a single railcar, 2) have containment to limit the  of a puddle that would develop from a spill, 3) are inside and sheltered from any wind. Due to the these storage conditions the interior storage tanks did not qualify for the worst-case scenario.\n\n     Based on the Criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario (ALOHA Modeling Program) for the process described is less then than the distance to the nearest public receptor as defined in 40 CFR 68.30\n\n     The facility is entirely fenced with a single point of entry on the southwest corner. A guard is posted during non-operational hours.\n\n\n\n     General Prevention Plan\n\n     Beyond the procedures outlined herein, 40 CFR 68 requires no additional General Prevention Plan for this Program 1 Facility\n\n\n\n     Emergency Response:\n\n          The Facility maintains a Facility Emergency Plan that is a guideline for emergencies involving fire, and medical emergencies as well and chemical spills (hazardous and non-hazardous). This plan designates a Facility Emergency Coordinator and his responsibilities as well as that of the Emergency Responders. It contains a facility a evacuation procedure, spill notification policy and specific spill cont"
