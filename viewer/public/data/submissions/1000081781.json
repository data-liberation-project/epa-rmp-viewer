      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nNeches Industrial Park, Inc. began operations in November 1995.  The terminal was purchased by Martin Midstream Partners LP in June of 2004 and renamed Neches Terminal.  Martin is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Toward meeting this commitment the facility has in place an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee, General Land Office, Coast Guard and any other state or Federal agencies in mitigating any release and minimizing the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED OR STORED\r\nMartin stores and handles the following regulated substances:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS: 7664-41-7)\r\nStorage Quantity:  89,000,000 lbs\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility, with the majority utilized for distribution to end users.  Shipment methods include bulk cargo trailers, rail, and barge.  A small portion of the ammonia is utilized for the on-site production of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), which is considered part of the overall ammonia-PSM operations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the rupture of a 34,000-ton (short) aboveground ammonia storage tank.  EPA rules would not allow use of water for mitigation when calculating our worst-case scenario.  Martin believes that the endpoint distance of 25 miles would be significantly reduced, since the tank is near water.  The endpoint distance was concluded using off-site consequence analysis guidance.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is based upon the activation of a railcar pressure relief valve and was selected due to the f"

In addition\r\n\r\n   \u00bf  Fire monitors are strategically placed to mitigate the effects of a release of ammonia.\r\n\r\n   \u00bf  Work permits are used to control any hazardous work around the facility\r\n\r\n   \u00bf  Management ensures that all personnel have the required level of"
