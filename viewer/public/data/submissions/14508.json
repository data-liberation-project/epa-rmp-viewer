The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nYOUR COMPANY  complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to\nadhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of\nanhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the YOUR FIRE DEPT. and request that\nthey respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks is 83,400 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-case release scenario.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  If you considered any either passive or active mitigation measures please identify them and their effect on the release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regualtions.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  Storage and Handling of "

We have notified this policy with the fire department.\n\nThe facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
