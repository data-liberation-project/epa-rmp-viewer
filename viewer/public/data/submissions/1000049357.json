If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides, and agronomic services to growers and ranchers. To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\na.    Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals, and packaged seed. All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers. No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nb.    Four agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are regulated substances in California.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility. It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient. Anhydrous Ammonia is also used at the facility in the manufacturing of Aqua Ammonia and Ammonium Polyphosphate. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 18,000-gallon capacity ASTs. The capacity allowed per tank is 85 percent; thus, the maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at the facility is 157,590 lbs.\n\nd.    Aqua Ammonia (24.4 percent of ammonia by weight) is manufactured and stored at the facility. It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient. Aqua Ammonia (24.4 percent of ammonia by weight) is stored in one AST. The tank capacity is 54,300 gallons (412,680 lbs.) and piping capacity is 166 gallons (1,262 lbs.). Maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia at the facility is 413,942 lbs. containing 101,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\ne.    Various quantities of anhydrous ammonia are stored in 66 nurse tank mounted on trailers parked at the facility in a designated parking area. The 66 nurse tanks can hold a maximum of 269,216 pounds of ammonia if each tank is filled to 85 percent capacity. \n\n \n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe regulations require that estimates be made of the radius of accidental release scenarios including a worst-case scenario defined in the regulations as \"the entire contents of the largest vessel or container being released in a ten-minute time period.\" An alternative release scenario that is more likely to happen than the worst-case scenario must also be estimated. Per EPA guidance, the results of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios are not reported in the Executive Summary, but are available in the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. EPA risk management plan (RMP) RMP report.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION"

Facility management and employees involved in covered processes are trained and aware of their responsibilities in implementing RMP program requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn the past 5 years, there have been no releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia, or any of the four regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse that have caused any deaths, injuries or property damage at the facility nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan. The local fire department is the Primary Local Response Agency and in the past has conducted a facility visit specifically addressing their response to releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia, and products stored in the Chemical Warehouse. Two emergency response (ER) contractors from Sacramento are available for the facility; in the past the ER contractor has visited the facility to review how they would respond if a release occurred. Five employees at the facility are trained as emergency responders to the HAZWOPER Technician Level; their most recent training was completed in March 2012 The facility emergency responders and the other employees participate in an emergency response drill once each year; the most recent drill occurred January 21, 2014.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt the time this document was prepared, there were four new recommendations at the facility as a result of the 2014 Process Hazard Analysis revalidation. All PHA recommendations have been implemented. Safety, though, is an on-going process at this facility. Compliance inspections and audits are conducted periodically to determine how well the facility is in compliance with regulatory and company requirements. Changes may occur as a consequence of these activities. Implementatio"
