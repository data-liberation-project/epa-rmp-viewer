      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe City of Orlando owns and operates the Iron Bridge Regional Water Reclamation Facility (IBWRF), located at 601 Iron Bridge Circle, Florida.  The IBWRF uses two regulated toxic substances, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities for these substances in the RMP rule.                                                                                            \n\n\n\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant and sulfur dioxide useful for dechlorination also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions as a safeguard to our workers, our community, and the environment.  These chemicals are notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from much higher exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\n\n\n\nThe City of Orlando's commitment at the IBWRF is to store, handle and use chemicals in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing safe processes, maintaining the processes in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine, sulfur dioxide or methane release, should a process accident ever occur.  Our commitment to employee and community protection is demonstrated in the fact that over IBWRF's entire operating history, there have been no chemical accidents that resulted in death, serious employee injury or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for accidenta"

      "SummaryText": "l release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe primary measures for accidental chemical release prevention are contained in the document Process Safety Management/Risk Management Programs for IBWRF.  The process safety management (PSM) document (for chlorine/sulfur dioxide) was prepared in conformance with the OSHA and/or EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention.  IBWRF's Plant Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that these prevention programs are implemented in the workplace as written.\n\n\n\nThe IBWRF emergency response plan relies on a team of onsite trained personnel and, as necessary, offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services.  The emergency response plans are based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the IBWRF and regional response plans.  IBWRF's personnel receive annual chlorine emergency response training, which includes the donning of protective equipment and hands-on application of the chlorine cylinder repair kits kept at the plant.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide is received at the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all chemical cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the cylinders are stored inside covered storage areas equipped with detectors that immediately notify the operators of a release should a leak occur.  Up to 96,000 pounds of chlorine are stored inside an enclosed building for disinfection purposes; and up to 48,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are stored inside an enclosed building for dechlorination purposes. \n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs "

      "SummaryText": "part of IBWRF's emergency prevention and response efforts, a hazard assessment was conducted in compliance with EPA requirements contained in 40 CFR 68, Subpart B.  The hazard assessment included the development of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the regulated chemicals.\n\n\n\nEPA defines a worst-case release as a scenario involving the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe.  For the toxic chemicals, this involves the release of the entire contents of the one-ton chlorine cylinder used for disinfection into an enclosed building.  The release is assumed to occur over a 10-minute period.  Applying the worst-case parameters to the IBWPCF situation results in a distance to chlorine endpoint (defined as 0.0087 milligrams per liter) of 0.9 miles.  In other words, any human or environmental receptors within 0.9 mile of the chlorine storage building are within the worst-case distance. \n\n\n\nEPA defines an alternative release as a scenario more likely than the worst-case, but that nevertheless results in an impact offsite (unless no such release is possible).  Passive and active mitigation measures (chlorine detection, operator response, etc.) are considered in this scenario.  Without an accident history on which to base a more likely scenario, a scenario was selected based on information provided in the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release.  The scenario involved the release of chlorine liquid through a broken 0.25-inch diameter whip inside the building.  Response time is conservatively assumed to occur in 60 minutes.  This scenario results in a distance to chlorine endpoint of 0.1 mile.  There are no public or environmental receptors affected by this release.  The sulfur dioxide scenario is identical to that for disinfection chlorine and also results in a 0.1 mile impact distance. \n\n\n\nThe distance to endpoint calculations were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp model.  The RMP*Comp model was developed specific"

Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:  \n\n\n\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processe, to identify potential process failure scenarios and the appropriate prevention or response measures.  The hazard review for the digesters involved a comprehensive evaluation of the adequacy of the design and procedures to prevent a release.  The process hazard analysis will be updated every 5 years.\n\n\n\n* Operating procedures review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the processes.\n\n\n\n* Training programs: Training is given to each employee assigned to the process with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling and emergency response.  The City has been on the forefront among utilities in chemical safety training.\n\n\n\n* Contractors: The City ensures through its contract provisions that contractors supplying or working with processes are held to a standard of safety performance that complies with the City's safety goals and objectives, and also meets relevant agency requirements.  \n\n\n\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of the process is maintained by implementing preventive maintenance and routine inspection and testing procedures.\n\n\n\n* Management of Change: The management of change procedures provide a systematic approach to evaluate and control the safety and health aspects of any significant change to the process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures.\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation: The City investigates w"

      "SummaryText": "ithin 48 hours any accidents or \"near misses\" that could have resulted in a chemical release, in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\nThe above elements are only part of the City's aggressive safety program.  In addition to the 13 PSM elements, IBWPCF has established related OSHA safety programs such as hot work and confined space.  These OSHA safety programs apply to both the City and contractor employees. \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving the release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIBWRF plant operators are provided with chlorine safety training that includes hands-on practice of assessing and repairing a chlorine leak.  Because the cylinders are nearly identical, this training applies to sulfur dioxide as well.  Plant personnel also review the emergency response flow diagram and emergency plan on an annual basis.  The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for employee accounting, notification procedures, medical duties, and response procedures for spills or leaks.  If a major chemical leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe City is committed to continuously improving the safety of its operations for the benefit of its personnel, the surrounding community and the environment.  Implementation of the process safety management procedures, periodic audits and process hazard analyses, and employee training are some of the means to achieve this continuous improvement.  "
