All plant personnel are certified by the North Carolina Water Treatment Facility Operators Board of Certification, and continue to receive chlorine specific safety training.  Chemical inventory and material safety data information have been filed with local emergency management planning officials.  Tours of the facility have been conducted for area firefighters and first responders whose help in emergency situations would be needed.  Two inspections of the facility have been requested and completed during the past year by consultants of the North Carolina Division of Occupational Safety and Health."
