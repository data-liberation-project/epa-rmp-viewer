Mosaic has established a process safety management system to ensure safe operation of the processes at the Riverview facility.\r\nThe risk management program (RMP) aids in the management of risks involved with the presence of hazardous substances at the Riverview. The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release. One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to include an executive summary in the RMP describing the program in place at Mosaic. This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary.\r\n\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nThe Riverview risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n1.A hazard assessment designed to identify the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n2.A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n3.An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule. \r\nInformation: The risk management program helps ensure that the Riverview is maintained and operated in a safe manner. The comprehensive safety program in place, establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and injuries and damage that could potentially occur.\r\n\r\nLIMITING THE USE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES\r\nBefore hazardous substances are incorporated in Mosaic processes, consideration is given to alternative products that are less hazardous. \r\nWhen a hazardous substance is the only choice, consideration is given to the potential adverse effects to employees, the public, and environmental.

Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes the following:\r\nAn inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and \r\nA quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\nAll proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures are evaluated in order to ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.

The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions during handling in order to:\r\nPrevent unnecessary human exposure\r\nReduce the threat to facility personnel \r\nReduce the threat to the community and the environment\r\nAt the Riverview facility, ammonia storage exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\r\nAmmonia is used as a raw material at the Riverview. Ammonia as liquefied gas is stored in tanks. The ammonia is piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and Diammonium phosphate (DAP) plants. Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture. Ammonia is transported into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline and is stored in four storage vessels (bullets). The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons. Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in each bullet to 175 tons.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nAt Mosaic, safety is the highest priority.

The valves on the ammonia bullets piping are designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). \r\nAll ammonia lines transferring liquid or gaseous product are inspected for mechanical integrity at regular frequencies. \r\nAll ammonia pressure relief valves are also maintained per API and ASME good engineering practices.
