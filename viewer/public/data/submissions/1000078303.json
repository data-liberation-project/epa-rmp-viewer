Mosaic has established a process safety management system to ensure safe operation of the processes at the Riverview facility.\n\nThe risk management program (RMP) aids in the management of risks involved with the presence of hazardous substances at the Riverview. The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release. One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to include an executive summary in the RMP describing the program in place at Mosaic. This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nThe Riverview risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1.A hazard assessment designed to identify the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2.A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n3.An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule. \n\nInformation: The risk management program helps ensure that the Riverview is maintained and operated in a safe manner. The comprehensive safety program in place, establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and injuries and damage that could potentially occur.\n\n\n\nLIMITING THE USE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES\n\nBefore hazardous substances are incorporated in Mosaic processes, consideration is given to alternative products that are less hazardous. \n\nWhen a hazardous substance is the only choice, consideration is given to the potential adverse effects to employees, the public, and environmental. Prevention measures are implemented to reduce e"

The workforce is trained to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and to mitigate or stop the release.  Riverview works closely with the Riverview and Hillsborough County Fire Departments, and the local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact to employees, the community and environmental by of the release of any hazardous material. The Riverview safety program consists of a number of elements, some of which are required by the RMP rule. \n\nThe RMP is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. \n\nWe take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These steps include: \n\n\n\nTRAINING PROGRAMS FOR PERSONNEL\n\nPrograms to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and Programs to evaluate the hazards of our processes.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Riverview strives to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and mitigate injury to the public or damage to the environment.\n\nRiverview provides emergency response training to our employees so that they are well prepared to handle emerg"

The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions during handling in order to:\n\nPrevent unnecessary human exposure\n\nReduce the threat to facility personnel \n\nReduce the threat to the community and the environment\n\nAt the Riverview facility, ammonia storage exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nAmmonia is used as a raw material at the Riverview. Ammonia as liquefied gas is stored in tanks. The ammonia is piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and Diammonium phosphate (DAP) plants. Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture. Ammonia is transported into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline and is stored in four storage vessels (bullets). The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons. Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in each bullet to 175 tons.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAt Mosaic, safety is the highest priority. Beginning in 1992, Mosaic incorporated this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) regulation. \n\nFor Mosaic, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM regulation. \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n\nThe Site accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nMosaic maintains a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to ensure that employees and local emergency responders are award of the hazards associated with"
