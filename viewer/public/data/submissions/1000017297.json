              "Description": "Emery Oleochemicals operates three Solvent Separation Units that separate saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerent in the process.  The two largest units, Solvent D and E, are similar in design with nearly identical safeguards including ammonia leak detection sensors, relief valves with rupture disks underneath to prevent weapage through the relief valves (the rupure disks also have fracture detection with alarms), an independent safety instrumented control system (SIS) for all process safety interlocks.  Both units are operated and controlled using a Distributive Control System.\n\nThe other process, Solvent B, is the smallest unit and is operated intermittently based on production demand and product mix.  This unit has panel board controls.  Upgrades including DCS control, SIS and ammonia detectors are planned in 2011.\n\nEmery Oleochemicals LLC, Cincinnati plant uses safety systems and procedures to prevent accidents. The systems are reviewed regularly and, where needed, improved.  Equipment is constructed to State of Ohio and nationally recognized codes and designed to withstand the maximum pressure, temperature and corrosive nature of the contained chemical.    Special instruments continuously monitor process conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and automatically alarm if they go outside acceptable ranges. Critical alarms trigger safety interlocks that shut down the process. To maintain the integrity of our equipment, verification checks are performed at frequencies recommended by the equipment manufacturers. Equipment deficiencies are addressed immediately.  Qualified personnel complete full, in-depth Process Hazards Analysis that are revalidated at least every five years as specified by OSHA regulations. Recommendations are developed to further protect our employees, neighbors and local environment.  Operating instructions have been written to detail how processes are safely started, operated and shut down.  These procedures are accuracy-certified each year, per OSHA regulations.  All operators, maintenance mechanics and contractors are trained and qualified to perform their job duties.  Engineers, operators and mechanics jointly complete a final safety check prior to introducing hazardous chemicals into a new or modified process. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are completed after maintenance turnarounds. Management personnel must authorize all changes to the chemicals used, equipment, or operating conditions.  Potential safety and environmental impacts must be remedied before any change can take place.  Work permits are necessary prior to working on equipment that last contained hazardous chemicals.  These permits are used to verify that the equipment has been properly prepared to prevent a chemical exposure or fire.  Our entire site perimeter is fenced.   Guards are stationed at plant gates.  All chemical release incidents are investigated and actions taken to prevent recurrence.  Triennial audits are performed to insure the chemical release prevention program requirements are followed.",

The continuous unit and operating batch unit have similar safeguards including:\n\n. electrical system design for hydrogen environments,\n. hydrogen leak detectors mounted above process equipment containing hydrogen,\n. Safety Instrumented Control Systems (SIS) that operate independently of the primary control systems,\n. Distributive Control operating system that provides a \"picture\" of the units for the plant operators for safe control of pressures, temperatures, vessel levels, and flows, \n. vent scrubbers, and\n. Fire suppression systems.\n\nThe currently idled batch unit will be upgraded to meet current safety standards prior to being restarted.\n\nEmery Oleochemicals LLC, Cincinnati plant uses safety systems and procedures to prevent accidents. The systems are reviewed regularly and, where needed, improved. Equipment is constructed to State of Ohio and nationally recognized codes and designed to withstand the maximum pressure, temperature and corrosive nature of the contained chemical.   Special instruments continuously monitor process conditions, such as temperature and pressure, and automatically alarm if they go outside acceptable ranges.  Critical alarms trigger safety interlocks that shut down the process.  To maintain the integrity of our equipment, verification checks are performed at frequencies recommended by the equipment manufacturers.  Equipment deficiencies are addressed immediately.  Qualified personnel complete full, in-depth Process Hazards Analysis that are revalidated at least every five years as specified by OSHA regulations.  Recommendations are developed to further protect our employees, neighbors and local environment.  Operating instructions have been written to detail how processes are safely started, operated and shut down.  These procedures are accuracy-certified each year, per OSHA regulations.  All operators, maintenance mechanics and contractors are trained and qualified to perform their job duties.  Engineers, operators and mechanics jointly complete a final safety check prior to introducing hazardous chemicals into a new or modified process. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are completed after maintenance turnarounds. Management personnel must authorize all changes to the chemicals used, equipment, or operating conditions.  Potential safety and environmental impacts must be remedied before any change can take place.  Work permits are necessary prior to working on equipment that last contained hazardous chemicals.  These permits are used to verify that the equipment has been properly prepared to prevent a chemical exposure or fire.  Our entire site perimeter is fenced.   Guards are stationed at plant gates.  All chemical release incidents are investigated and actions taken to prevent recurrence.  Triennial audits are performed to insure the chemical release prevention program requirements are followed.",

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nAt Emery Oleochemicals LLC Cincinnati, Ohio manufacturing plant, protection of employees, the public and the environment is considered to be the most important responsibility.  A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.\n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the \"worst-case release scenarios\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative release scenarios\"). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.07), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nEMERY OLEOCHEMICALS LLC\n\nCognis Corporation carved out the Fatty Acid, Glycerine, Ozone Acids and Plastics Technology Businesses creating Cognis Oleochemicals LLC in January 2006.

Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.  Plant personnel receive regular safety training, and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety performance improvement.  Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate or shelter employees as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to control the release and minimize its consequences.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\nThe Emery Oleochemicals LLC Cincinnati, Ohio plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 4900 Este Avenue.  A variety of processes are operated at the plant to produce products derived from animal fat or vegetable oil.  The plant, originally constructed in 1885, is situated on 40 acres of land. Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty Acids, Glycerine and Ozone Acids are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant. \n\nThe plant is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.

Ammonia, which is regulated as toxic substance, is used as a refrigerant in the Solvent Separation process.  Hydrogen, which is regulated as a flammable substance, is used as a process ingredient in the Hydrogenation processes that are part of the Stearic Acid manufacturing operations.  All of these processes have been assigned to RMP Program Level 3.\n\nNOTE:  The reporting of this Hydrogen system is a duplicate reporting. The system has also been reported by Air Products, Inc. (EPA ID # 1000 0001 8358) and Cognis Corporation. The system is completely owned, operated and maintained by Air Products but is located on property owned by Cognis Corporation and within the fence line of a Cognis operating facility.

      "SummaryText": "ITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing U. S. EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an good accident prevention record.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The plant has had one incident in the last five years that resulted in an employee injury.  On 6/8/09 at 11:48 pm, a release of hydrogen from a liquid collection pot prior to the hydrogen recirculation compressor ignited, and the operator received 2nd degree burns.  Plant personnel are available to answer any related questions.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Cincinnati plant.  Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents, and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates the hazards associated with a process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  They are reviewed periodically and certified annually as current and accurate.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities or for specialized maintenance work.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\nA? Perform their work in a safe manner, \nA? Have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\nA? Are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\nA? Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\nA? Understand and follow site safety rules, and \nA?

This helps ensure that the new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:\n\nA? Control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\nA? Permit and procedure for lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\nA? Procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened,\nA? Permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work),\nA? Permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space,\n. Permit and procedure for any excavation work,\n. Personal protective equipment standards based on the type of hazards workers may encounter,\n. Hazard Communication Program,\n. Hazardous Chemical safe handling procedures, and\n. Checklists and procedures for loading and unloading of tank trucks and rail cars.      \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being imple"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, a toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental damage, or an OSHA recordable injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for a least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Cincinnati plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  A compliance audit is conducted at least once every three years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective action plans developed in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until all items are comple"

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL- SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Cincinnati plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure or human error.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Cincinnati plant has safety features on many units to help detect, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\nA? Chemical detectors with alarms,\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\nA? Scrubbers to neutralize or cool process vent streams prior to release to the environment,\nA? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated),\nA? Automated shutdown systems to a process if an upset condition occurs (e.g., high level, high temperature),\nA? Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases,\nA? Redundant equipment and instrumentation,\nA? Emergency backup power supply for critical controls,\nA? Special classified electrical equipment in areas where flammable chemicals are used,\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\nA? Fire suppression and extinguishing systems,\nA? Trained emergency response personnel,\nA? Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus), and\nA? Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Cincinnati plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammabl"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response; including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the proper use of that equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based upon modifications made to the plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cincinnati plant is coordinated with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) as well as the Cincinnati and St. Bernard fire departments and other area businesses.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\nADDITIONAL EMERGENCY CONTACTS (supplement to Section 1.8)\n\nEmery Oleochemicals LLC, Cincinnati plant has a total of eight (8) Shift Supervisors that, while they are on duty, have the responsibility of being the Emergency Contact.
