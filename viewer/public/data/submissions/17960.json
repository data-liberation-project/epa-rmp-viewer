Facility Accidential Release Policy - The owners, management, and employees of Consolidated Grange Supply Cooperative, 318 West First, Lind, Washington 99341, with branch operations at 404 West First, Lind, Washington 99341 and 1201 West 1st. Ave., Ritzville, Washington 99169 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people ane the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2.  Facility Information - *  The primary activity at the Ritzville Fertilizer Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilzers to farmers.  * Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop nutrients. * At Ritzville the anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into a 18,000 gallon above ground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Ritzville in storage is 15,300 gallons = 78,795 lbs. * The Aqua Ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into a 10,000 gallon Aqua ammonia and a 20,000-gallon Aqua Ammonia w/Sulfur above ground storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia at the facility is 28,500 gallons = 216,600 lbs.  The maximum storage in a single 20,000 gallon storage tank @ 95% capacity is 19,000 gallons = 144,400 lbs.  The maximum storage in a single 10,000 gallon storage tank @ 9,500 gallons = 72,700 lbs.  3.  The Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario's - a. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario's - The worst case release scenario for the Ritzville Fertilizer Facility is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release "

      "SummaryText": "79,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to end point is .83 miles.  The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident from a 2\" diameter pipe.  The distance to endpoint 11,900 pounds is .42 miles.  b.  Aqua Ammonia Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios - The worst case scenario for the facility is failure of the largest storage tnak when filled to the greatest amount would release 144,400 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  The distance to endpoint is .61 miles.  The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident isw a release of 2000 gallons (15,200 pounds) from a 20,000 gallon tank.  The distance to the endpoint is .18 miles.  4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program - The facility has implemented the provisionjs of the \"Safety Requirement for Storage and Handling of Anhydyrous Ammonia, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of OSHA.  5.  Five Year History - Ther have been no accidental releases of anhydrous or aqua ammonia in the past 5 years.  6.  The Emergency Response Program - The facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:  * OSHA 29CFR 1910.38; * OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120.  7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety - Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional planned specific changes to the aqua or anhydrous processes at the facility."
