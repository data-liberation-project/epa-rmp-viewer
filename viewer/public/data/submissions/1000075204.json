      "SummaryText": "The Baker Produce Pasco Holdings facility is a fruit processing and cold storage facility located outside the city of Pasco, County of Franklin, State of Washington. Anhydrous Ammonia, used as a refrigerant in the system, is considered a highly toxic chemical by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with a toxic threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Baker Produce Pasco has 14,708 pounds of ammonia in the closed-loop flooded system.  Safety precautions are followed by the facility to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce threat to personnel and reduce threat to the community and environment.\n\n\n\nUntil recently the facility has maintained a quantity of ammonia under the toxic threshold of 10,000 lbs, in order to minimize the threat of a major release and manage the chemical.  It became necessary to increase the amount of ammonia to adequately refrigerate the increased product coming into the facility. Management has made every effort to protect employees, the public and environment by keeping the risk as low as possible.\n\n\n\nThe facility has one engine room and 17 controlled atmosphere rooms.  The largest vessel is capable of holding 24,000 lbs of ammonia, which is more than the total amount of ammonia in the entire system.  If isolation was necessary, the vessel could hold all the ammonia in the system.  Isolation valves are located through out the system with remote operation and shutdown capabilities.  Engine room has outside kill switches and ammonia detectors.\n\n\n\nBaker Produce Pasco complies with OSHA, WA State Process Safety Management rules & regulations, WA State Safety Regulations and IIAR Standards for Good Work Practices.  The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems include:\n\n   Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely \n\n   Suction trap hi-level float\n\n   "

Actions to prevent a  major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate.  An Emergency Plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on the plan.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department, and emergency drills are practiced each year.  The plan instructs coordinators to call 911, evacuate facility and wait for Emergency Responders to take control.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures and a system of Checklists and Calendars have been established for use by refrigeration personnel to insure safe operational functions.  Training on these procedures, ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity procedures will continue to be a major process at Baker Produce Pasco Holdings.\n\n   "
