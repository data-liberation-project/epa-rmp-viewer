It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Victoria Water Plant 3 is municipal drinking water treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant and protectant for water introduced into the drinking water supply.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 10,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe EPA-defined worst case scenario is a failure of a 2,000-pound container full of chlorine. The 10-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because a building encloses the process.  This is the equivalent of 1,100 pounds of chlorine being released. Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nA more conceivable release, although still remote, is a failure of a flexible connection at the ton container. The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute and a distance from the Plant of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections at prescribed intervals.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Victoria Water Plant 3 is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. Plant and City personnel have conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as ad"

As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident History\nThe Water Plant 3 has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis Plant has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations, among others, were made as a result of the Water Plant 3 RMP. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\n' We are rehabilitating plant 3 to include leak detection and alarms \n' We have updated our operating and maintenance (O&M) procedures, and have elaborated on procedures more prone to human error.\n' We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's  O&M.\n' We will endeavor to develop and implement a chlorine supplier audit program.  For example, do they have emergency container repair kits? Do they maintain their equipment?  What is their pre-shipment inspection procedure?\n' We have developed an Emergency Response Program in coordination with the City of Victoria Fire Department\n"
