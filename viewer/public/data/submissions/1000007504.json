      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Aqueduct, is to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances through the use of proper equipment and procedures.  All equipment that is used on the chlorination system at the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is consistent with design criteria. All procedures for operating and maintaining equipment-handling chlorine are written and are regularly reviewed and revised as needed.  In addition, all personnel operating or maintaining chlorine-handling equipment are provided a high level of training.\n\nChlorine storage and feed areas are in enclosed buildings that contain multiple chlorine sensors.  In the event of a leak, these chlorine sensors provide an alarm to indicate to the operators that chlorine gas is at an elevated level in the building atmosphere.  In addition, these sensors are designed to activate the chlorine scrubber system in the event chlorine concentrations within the building exceed set thresholds.  Each separate chlorine area (storage and feed) contains its own scrubber system that is capable of scrubbing at least one ton of chlorine.\n\nIn the event that a substantial chlorine leak was to occur, specific Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond.  Personnel are trained to use personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), in order to address emergency situations in a safe manner.  In the event that a more serious leak was to occur than Dalecarlia personnel are able to address, local emergency responders would be contacted.  The Risk Management Plan is coordinated with local Hazmat personnel, in advance, as is required by the Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is located in Washington, D.C. at 5900 MacArthur Blvd, N.W., along the east bank of the Potomac River.  The plant rated capacity is 240 million gallons per day (MGD) and the average annual prod"

      "SummaryText": "uction of potable water is approximately 110 MGD.  At the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant, the Risk Management Program regulations are applicable to chlorine stored on site.  The amount of chlorine stored at the plant exceeds the 40 CFR Part 68 threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  \n\nThe Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  An electronic gate opener monitors and controls access to the plant, which is surrounded by a security fence.  A security guard is stationed at the front gate to admit visitors and deliveries on a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week schedule.\n\nThe general Washington Aqueduct accidental release prevention program for the Dalecarlia water treatment plant includes the following key elements:\n\nComprehensive training of operations and maintenance personnel\nComputerized preventive maintenance tracking system\nUse of process equipment meeting industry design specifications\nUse of state-of-the-art leak detection systems\nUse of effective and constantly reviewed and revised operating procedures with input from operations and maintenance staff\nPerformance of in-depth hazard review of Risk Management Program-regulated processes and equipment\nImplementation of a Risk Management Program audit program\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the use of air-line respirators for routine container connect/disconnects, presence of alarmed chlorine detectors in storage and feed areas, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine in use at the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no reportable accidents related to chlorine at the Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant\n\nThe facility has an Incident Response Program that has been coordinated with the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, the Metropolitan Police Department as well as other neighboring or cooperating agencies.  The D.C. Fire Department will respond in the event of a chemical emergen"

The latest table-top exercise with external participants occurred on February 19, 2004.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the continual refinement and implementation of the preventative maintenance program, operation and maintenance training program, as well as capital programs including various security improvement projects (Phase I completed in 2005, and Phase II, currently under design and expected completion in 2011), and the proposed process conversion to hypochlorite (under construction and expected completion in 2010)."
