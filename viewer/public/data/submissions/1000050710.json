As part of Lubrizol's philosophy, we believe in maintaining the health and safety of our employees, customers, community neighbors, and in protecting the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Lubrizol Deer Park facility is an OSHA Star VPP site.  \n\n\n\nLubrizol's Deer Park facility was founded in 1951 and is located on 330 acres along the north side of US 225 between Patrick's Bayou and East Boulevard. The plant is staffed by nearly 600 full-time Lubrizol employees and about 250 contractors. Each year the plant is recognized for community involvement in such areas as Partners in Education, Junior Achievement, Texas Scholars,  D.A.R.E., Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls Harbor, and numerous other charitable events. \n\n\n\nLubrizol emphasizes prevention of incidents.  However, we have a very dynamic emergency preparedness program should an unexpected event occur. Lubrizol is a founding member of Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA), the largest chemical plant mutual aide organization in the world.  We work closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC) and are active supporters of the American Chemistry Council's (ACC) Responsible Care program.  \n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThe Lubrizol Deer Park plant manufactures specialty chemical additives for lubricating oils used in gasoline and diesel engines, automatic transmissions, gear drives, marine engines and tractors. RMP covered materials include chlorine, 2- methylpropene, n-butane, propylene oxide, 1,3 butadiene, and pentane.  \n\n\n\nCh"

Chlorine does not remain in the products except in trace amounts. \n\n\n\n2-Methylpropene is used by our Poly Plant and IOB/SCL units to manufacture intermediates.  2- Methylpropene is introduced to the site via pipeline to reduce on-site inventory.  N-butane is separated from the supplied 2-methylpropene in the Poly Plant and returned to the supplier by pipeline. We have the capability to store n-butane and 2-methylpropene on site, although there is typically no stored inventory.\n\n\n\nPropylene Oxide is used in the manufacture of passenger car motor oils, heavy-duty engine oils and automotive and industrial gear oils. It is received in rail cars and stored on-site. \n\n\n\n1,3-Butadiene is used in the manufacturing of extreme pressure agents and corrosion inhibitors used in gear lubricants. It is received in rail cars and fed directly to the reactor where it is totally reacted to form a less hazardous material. \n\n\n\nPentane is a covered flammable used in the manufacture of marine diesel engine oils, automatic transmission fluids and other lubricating additive packages.  Lubrizol stores the material on-site.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLubrizol's Deer Park plant emphasizes prevention of incidents while maintaining an excellent emergency response program, good cooperation with its neighboring chemical plants through CIMA, and open dialog with the community through participation in the local LEPC and CAC. Lubrizol has established direct hot lines to neighboring Shell and Oxychem plants.\n\n\n\nLubrizol's attention to accident prevention begins very early in the life of a product with our New Chemical Introduction Process (NCIP) that evaluates and manages all aspects of new chemical introduction from inception to pr"

A second process, New Chemical Issues Assessment (NCIA), ensures that pollution prevention, inherent safety, and product stewardship consideration are addressed starting at invention and continuing through development.  A Process Hazard Analysis is performed on all expansions or modifications of sufficient risk to a manufacturing process before being put into service, whether or not they are covered under OSHA PSM or EPA RMP. \n\n\n\nOne successful strategy Lubrizol has used over the years for incident prevention is the reduction in quantity of hazardous material stored on-site.  In 1993, we significantly reduced chlorine storage by converting three chlorine storage tanks into containment tanks for a potential chlorine release. In another example, 2-methylpropene is now brought on the premises via pipeline rather than stored on-site.\n\n\n\nFor new facilities or modifications, the Deer Park plant uses generally accepted industry standards and practices. In addition, the plant has developed a multi-disciplinary set of Texas Standards for engineering, design, and construction standards and practices to be followed when industry standards and practices are not available. \n\n\n\nTo ensure that any new facility or facility modification is constructed according to good standards and practices the plant has a contractor qualification program.  All contractor craftsmen must receive training from the Houston Area Contractors Safety Council (HACSC). Part of the training received at the HACSC is site specific to the Lubrizol facility. \n\n\n\nHot Work Permits are required before welding, brazing, or any other activity that could generate a source of ignition. The Hot Work Permit documents that fire prevention and protection have been considered prior to beginning hot work. A key component of the Hot Work Permit is the requirement to have a \"Face to Face\" meeting at the work site between craftsman doing the work and the operator representative authorizing the work. Permits are requi"

The PSSR is a review by a multi-disciplinary team to confirm that the equipment is in accordance with design specifications and that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place.\n\n\n\nThere are prevention programs which focus on keeping an existing operating process safe when changes are made. The Lubrizol Deer Park plant follows a formal Management of Change (MOC) procedure. The purpose of the MOC procedure is to assure that the technical basis of the change is understood and that the impact of safety and health is considered prior to the change. \n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures for all of our processes are in place identifying safe operating limits, consequences of deviation from those limits, and corrective action to be taken in the event of a deviation. In addition, operating personnel receive training on the safe operation of their processes and are trained on process modifications, as they occur, as part of the Management of Change process. \n\n\n\nInspection and testing of existing pipe and equipment are key parts of the plant's Mechanical Integrity program. Piping and equipment are periodically inspected or tested to assure that they meet the design specifications. If deterioration is detected, the piping or piece of equipment is repaired or replaced.  This program identifies potential failures before they occur in a proactive fashion.\n\n\n\nAn employee safety program that we feel is very effective in reducing risk is called Safety Through Employee Participation (STEP).  This is a voluntary observation and feed-back program. Approximately 85% of our employees have elected to participate.  The STEP program identifies many near misses. Plant safety teams will then discuss and make recommendations to resolve potential probl"

There is a heavy emphasis on near miss investigations to prevent safety problems from occurring.\n\n\n\nIn addition to general protection measures, several of our RMP covered materials have special safeguards to reduce the likelihood and severity of potential releases.  2-Methylpropene and n-butane are covered under monthly/quarterly fugitive emissions monitoring.  Any leaks are repaired promptly.  This unit is also equipped with a flare that would be used to flare off (burn) excess material should there be an upset condition.  \n\n\n\nThe geographic footprint of the unit is covered with a grid of 59 flammable gas detectors that alarm aurally and visually in the area of the detected event and in the main process control system.  Due to the flammability of 2-methylpropene and n-butane, the entire area is protected with deluge systems that are zoned and have individual activation points.  Fire water curtains assist in isolating the 2-methylpropene area from the rest of the plant in the event of a release, reducing the potential for an event to impact other areas.  To ensure rapid response in the event of an emergency, a single button activation emergency shutdown system has been engineered into this unit.  There is also an independent secondary shutdown mechanism for the unit. \n\n \n\nFor chlorine, Lubrizol follows The Chlorine Institute recommended practices for safe handling.  We have also had our chlorine supplier visit the plant site and review our handling methods.  Emergency pressure relieving devices are designed to protect equipment from over pressure by relieving into containment tanks rather than directly to the atmosphere. We have also installed expansion bottles in the chlorine line to allow for liquid thermal expansion, preventing potential line leaks.  \n\n\n\nIn units that use chlorine, operators perform a chlorine line inspection every six hours to insure there are no leaks.

Several emergency shutdown stations are located throughout the processing area where, by activation of a single push button, the chlorine piping can be isolated from a leak point.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of EPA covered chemicals at Lubrizol's Deer Park plant in the past five years which had an adverse impact on the community.  There were two incidents at the facility each with an employee injury that triggered RMP reporting requirements.  One incident occurred in August 2012 when an employee was treated for chlorine inhalation due to a leaking flange.  It was determined that the flange had not been properly tightened prior to reinstatement.  The total chlorine released was estimated at about one pound.  The second incident occurred when an instrument technician was removing a temperature element from an isobutylene compressor.  The thermowell backed out of the compressor and a small flash fire occurred.  The fire caused a lost time injury to the technician.   An estimated three pounds of isobutylene was released and consumed in the flash fire.  In neither case was there any significant damage to equipment.  Ad-hoc committees were formed to study, identify the root cause, and make recommendations for improvement.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLubrizol emphasizes prevention of incidents, however, we have a very active Emergency Preparedness Program. Emergency response teams are available in the plant 24 hours a day. The plant has more than 100 people trained in emergency response and an additional staff of over ninety people on our emergency response paging system. Emergency response personnel at Lubrizol's Deer Park facility receive more than 6,000 aggregate hours of training annually. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant alarm system activates the Emergency Response Team to mitigate the incident.

Lubrizol utilizes an Incident Command System with documented emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nApproximately 350-400 feet of underground chlorine pipeline was replaced in October 2014.  The new pipeline is equipped with cathodic protection and is capable of being pigged for proper inspection.  The project was implemented to reduce the risk of corrosion and failure due to years of exposure to humidity.\n\n\n\nFurther improvements are planned for October 2015.  The relief valves in chlorine service will be upgraded from conventional type to balanced bellows to prevent potential chlorine leaks.  Set pressures will be increased from 170 to 200 psig to reduce the possibility of pressure spikes caused by summer heat to result in an inadvertent release.  Also, hydraulic calculations have identified a need to increase the inlet line size and rupture disk on the chlorine surge drum in certain relief scenarios.  This will be corrected in October 2015 as well.\n\n\n\nFor our pentane handling unit, numerous minor changes have been implemented to make the unit safer.  Some flex hoses have been made lighter to improve ergonomics and others have been replaced with piping.  Nitric acid is no longer handled in drums and with portable pumps, but instead in totes and with fixed pumps.  Improved automation reduces operator physical tasks within the unit.  Extensive repairs to the pentane storage tank were implemented after a routine inspection identified a corrosion under insulation concern.\n\n \n\nThe Deer Park facility achieved OSHA VPP st"
