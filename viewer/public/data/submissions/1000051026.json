(GAS) Pleasant Grove Facility (Facility) located at 4036 Pleasant Grove Road, Pleasant  Grove, California 95668 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (ER/CP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n2.\tFACILITY INFORMATION\r\n?\u00bf\tThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\r\n?\u00bf\tAqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 25,000-gallon, above-ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 380,000 pounds.    \r\n3.\tTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for the regulated process.  The results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\r\n4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\r\nSafety Information:  GAS ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered process took place in April 2015.\r\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the aqua ammonia process is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the proc"

Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered process and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised in May 2015.\r\nTraining:  The GAS Facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group, Inc. (Tremont) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.  The training program was last reviewed in May 2015.  The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n?\u00bf\tInitial employee training;\r\n?\u00bf\tPeriodic refresher training;\r\n?\u00bf\tTraining provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\r\n?\u00bf\tCompetency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\r\n?\u00bf\tTraining records for each employee.\r\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted on July 2, 2015, and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted in May 2015.\r\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years.  Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in April 2013. \r\nIncident Investigation:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occ"
