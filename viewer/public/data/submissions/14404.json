The Daisetta Underground Storage Facility has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n \n3.\tHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  It assumes the worst-case meteorological conditions that would allow the release to have the greatest distance of impact.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industries to develop a more realistic emergency planning scenario.\n\nThe WCS for flammable substances at the Daisetta Underground Storage Facility is the release of NGL.  The ARS for flammable substances is the release of NGL from a >\" valve failure.  Our prevention programs described in section one and five mitigate offsite impact. \n\n\n4.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Daisetta Underground Storage Facility has had no accidental releases of regulated toxic or flammable substances from covered processes within the last five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n5.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo ensure that our Risk Management Program is effectively implemented and managed, the Refinery Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the EHS Manager.

      "SummaryText": "Facility has developed programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Mobil Oil Corporation, Daisetta Underground Storage Facility received the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program STAR Certification in 1996.    Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the industry.  OSHA audits these facilities for compliance every three years in order to maintain certification. Much effort has also been devoted to environmental programs such as waste reduction and emissions minimization.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process management systems address each of the essential elements of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information \t\t- Pre-startup review\n- Process hazard analysis \t\t\t- Compliance audits\n- Operating procedures\t\t\t- Incident investigation\n- Training\t\t\t\t\t- Employee participation\n- Mechanical integrity\t\t\t- Hot work permit system\n- Management of change \t\t\t- Contractor safety\n\nOur risk management program uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  \n\nIn addition to our industry leading management programs, we have designed state-of-the-art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases. \n\nWe employ extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure sound equipment.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be deteriorating and in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.\n\n \nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.
