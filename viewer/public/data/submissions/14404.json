Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nOperations at the Mobil Oil Corporation, Daisetta Underground Storage Facility involve storing, and transferring to market, hazardous materials that present a degree of risk.  Recognizing these risks, the Daisetta Underground Storage Facility has an established environmental, health, and safety management system to:  \n\n7 Effectively manage our process operations;\n7 Invest in the latest process safety technologies;\n7 Educate and provide ongoing training for our people;\n7 Review our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n7 Ensure safety and the environment are considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance; and\n7 Train and maintain a highly efficient Emergency Response Organization.\n\nBy effectively managing the procedures, technology, and personnel interfaces that produce excellence in our operations, we minimize risks and thus effectively manage and minimize the impact of process related incidents.\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Daisetta Underground Storage Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n\n7 Our history of support and commitment to the community;\n7 Our high environmental standards; and \n7 Our recognition and certification as a STAR facility in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nWe are proud of our Safety and Environmental Programs and continue to strive to be among the best in industry.\n\n\n2.

The Daisetta Underground Storage Facility has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n \n3.    Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  It assumes the worst-case meteorological conditions that would allow the release to have the greatest distance of impact.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industries to develop a more realistic emergency planning scenario.\n\nThe WCS for flammable substances at the Daisetta Underground Storage Facility is the release of NGL.  The ARS for flammable substances is the release of NGL from a >\" valve failure.  Our prevention programs described in section one and five mitigate offsite impact. \n\n\n4.    Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Daisetta Underground Storage Facility has had no accidental releases of regulated toxic or flammable substances from covered processes within the last five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n5.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo ensure that our Risk Management Program is effectively implemented and managed, the Refinery Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to the EHS Manager.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Refinery Manager, has the necessary training, experience, and resources to coordinate implementation of our Risk Management Program.\n\n \nThe Daisetta Underground Storage"
