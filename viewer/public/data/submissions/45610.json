      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n    At the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine\u00bfs introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.  Furthermore, public health has benefited from the use of anhydrous ammonia in water disinfection processes because of the reduction in the formation of disinfection by-products.\n    However, it is important to recognize that the use of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia is not risk free.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n    As an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n    The City of Fort Lauderdale Public Services Department has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-"

The facility\u00bfs mission is to protect public health by providing our community with safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 650 pounds per day of chlorine gas and 60 pounds per day of anhydrous ammonia are used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 16,000 pounds of chlorine and 34,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are stored on-site.  The chlorine and ammonia are stored as gases that are liquefied under pressure.\n                                                                                                                                                                             CHLORINE PROCESS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT\n    The chlorine system at the Peele-Dixie WTP is a gas feed system.  It consists of an outdoor, covered chlorine storage and handling area and an enclosed room containing five chlorinators (chlorine vapor flow control meters).  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine vapor as it is fed under vacuum to the various chlorine injection points throughout the plant.\n    Eight one-ton containers are stored in the chlorine storage and handling area at any one time.  Each container is secured in a separate steel cradle to prevent it from moving.  The containers are hooked up to two manifolds, four containers per manifold.  One manifold is i"

The chlorine containers are hooked up to the manifold through individual 2-foot, 3/8-inch diameter flexible copper tubing.  The manifolds that the chlorine feed tubes are hooked up to are constructed of schedule 80 1-inch diameter black steel pipe.\n    The chlorine gas passes through the manifold to a vacuum regulator, which drops the pressure in the system to a very slight vacuum.  As water flows through the injectors, the vacuum created by the pressure differential draws the chlorine vapor from the regulator through the chlorinators and into the injectors.  At the injectors chlorine gas is mixed with water to form a chlorine solution.  The piping in the vacuum portion of the system is composed of schedule 80 PVC pipe.  Should a leak develop in the piping downstream of the vacuum regulator, chlorine would not be released.  Instead, air would be drawn into the injectors.  In addition, loss of vacuum alarms in the chlorinators would activate.\n                                                                                                                                                                             AMMONIA PROCESS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT\n    The Peele-Dixie WTP ammonia system is a gas feed system.  The ammonia system operates by feeding gaseous ammonia from one of two above-ground storage tanks.  One tank has a capacity of 6,565 gallons while the other can hold 1,415 gallons.  A manually operated switchover system allows for switching from one storage tank to the other.  Ammonia gas flows under pressure from the storage tank to the vacuum regulator-check unit (VRCU).  At the VRCU, the gas pressure is reduced to a slight vacuum.\n    The vacuum created in the injector assemblies pulls the ammonia gas from the VRCU through the ammoniators (which control the flowrate of the gas) and into the injectors.  The ammonia gas is mixed with water in the injectors to form an ammonia"

The deluge system is designed to automatically spray water on the tank and cool it if sensors detect a high pressure or temperature in the tank.  In addition, the deluge system can be used to mitigate the consequences of a leak because ammonia gas would readily be absorbed by the water spray.\n                                                                                                                                                                                     RISK MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW\nChlorine and anhydrous ammonia are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n    The primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n* A five-year accident history\n* An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\n* A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e. minimize the potential for a release)\n* An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled\n* An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\n    Following development of the RMP submitted in year 1999, the facility must submit a RMP Update to the EPA by June 21, 2004.
