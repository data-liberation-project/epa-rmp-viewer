Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Buttonwillow Warehouse Company (BWC) Heck Ranch has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 BWC Heck Ranch, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that BWC Heck Ranch has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                 | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Fertilizer             Anhydrous Ammonia                48,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\nButtonwillow Warehouse Company operates a fertilizer storage and resale location named \u0093Heck Ranch\u0094. BWC Heck Ranch is a fertilizer storage and resale facility. The ammonia process operates as follows. Ammonia is supplied by a vendor into the ammonia storage tank. From there it is stored until a sale is made, at which time a BWC Heck Ranch employee transfers ammonia from the storage tank into a smaller trailer-mounted nurse tank. The nurse tanks are towed by trucks off site for the fertilizer application.\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nBWC Heck Ranch is located half mile south of Nevada Ave. and S. 19th Avenue Stratford, CA 93266, then 1 mile east. The latitude and longitude of the ammonia storage tank is 36.131333, -119.780361. The facility is located approximately 5.8 miles east of state highway 41 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\nBWC Heck Ranch is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that BWC Heck Ranch had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Process Classification\nThe ammonia process at BWC Heck Ranch consists of a single storage vessel. Therefore, the ammonia storage vessel is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3 General Ac"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nBWC Heck Ranch has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia fertilizer process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia fertilizer process at the BWC Heck Ranch facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 48,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\nOur personnel monitor the ammonia fertilizer process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nBWC Heck Ranch has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nBWC Heck Ranch's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, D"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBWC Heck Ranch has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, BWC Heck Ranch continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved BWC Heck Ranch's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that BWC Heck Ranch's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nBWC Heck Ranch has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, BWC Heck Ranch has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, BWC Heck Ranch now thinks of the RMP"
