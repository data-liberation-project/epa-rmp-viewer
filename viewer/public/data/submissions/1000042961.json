Dodge, Iowa\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nFOR \r\nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction and Policies\r\n\r\nKoch Fertilizer Ft. Dodge, LLC (KFFD) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KFFD's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKFFD produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \r\n\r\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in cooling towers) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at KFFD in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis RMP consists of one process, nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing.  The prevention program is divided"

In past submittals, these units were Ammonia, UAN, Loading & Storage, and Water Treatment Chlorination.  In 2012, the Water Treatment Chlorination PHA was incorporated into the UAN PHA.  Therefore, in the current submittal, the prevention program consists of three units, Ammonia, UAN and Loading & Storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n  \r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KFFD.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nKFFD is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the severity of chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-\tConstructing a blast-proof building to house our control room, maintenance personnel, and administrative offices.  The building may also be used as an emergency shelter as needed.\r\n-\tInstalling ammonia detectors throughout the plant to help ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as quickly as possible.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in"

This incident occurred in September 2009 and resulted in an injury that required medical treatment.\r\n \r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n \r\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for KFFD with the Region V LEPC, the Vincent Fire Department, and the Webster County Sheriff.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be Trinity Regional Medical Center and the Iowa State Patrol.  The KFFD Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Integrated Contingency Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations."
