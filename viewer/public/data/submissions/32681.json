Viskase utilizes the regulated chemical carbon disulfide in the cellulose food casing process.  Viskase?s commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Viskase?s installation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring detection systems.

The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employee participation. The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and that the processes are operating according to good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. A preventative maintenance and replacement policy of parts and equipment ensures that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to"

      "SummaryText": " a release incident. All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of carbon disulfide is prevented.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of carbon disulfide have occurred at Viskase in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nViskase has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38) that includes provisions to evacuate employees from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical.  It is Viskase?s policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Viskase also conducts periodic community drills with the local fire department, the local police department and the local emergency response agency. Viskase utilizes an emergency response group (Philip Emergency Response Services) that will respond to a hazardous chemical release and any cleanup operations. Viskase has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local emergency management agency will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nViskase is committed to continuous efforts to improve the safe operation of the carbon disulfide process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system. The carbon disulfide process is designed in accordance with good engineering practices. Periodic auditing of the Process Safety Management Prevention Program ensures that any system changes or modifications are evaluated and necessary safety precautions and or safety improvements are made before the process is placed into operation.\n\n\n\n??\n\n\n\n??\n\n\n\n??\n\n\n\n??\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CONTINUED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nViskase Corporation, "
