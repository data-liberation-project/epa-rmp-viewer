The State of Oklahoma has a mandatory water and wastewater operator certification program.  An individual is required to understand the dangers and handling techniques for chlorine gas prior to being able to obtain the lowest level of certification.  \n\nDue to limited personnel, it is the policy of the City for the wastewater personnel to notify the local fire department in the event of an accidental release.  Plant personnel are not to respond to the release.  The Fire Department has personnel with HAZWOPR training. \n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\nThe regulated process from this plant is the disinfection system.  Disinfection is accomplished with the use of chlorine gas. 3,000 - 4,000 pounds of chlorine gas is kept on-site and stored in the chlorine structure.  The gas is delivered to the site in one ton cylinders. \n\n(c) The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario,\n\nThe worst-case release scenario review was the loss of one ton of chlorine in a ten-minute period.  Due to prevailing winds from the SW it is unlikely that the gas would move towards an inhabited area.  Due to the topography we used an  urban setting. The plant is located in a low area.  The chlorine cylinders are surrounded by a three-sided enclosure with a roof.  \n\nIn the event of a release, the fire department would be notified, and they would take the necessary precautions to protect the public.\n\nWe also review and alternate release scenario.  We reviewed the potential for a 1/4\" hole in a cylinder.  Again the fire department would be notified.  We maintain a chlorine repair kit for such emergencies.  These supplies will be available to t"
