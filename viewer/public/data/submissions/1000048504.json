Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Dresick Cooling has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1 Dresick Cooling, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Dresick Cooling has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name         |     Process Chemical     |     Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration      Anhydrous Ammonia          40,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2."

      "SummaryText": " Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nDresick Cooling is a commercial packinghouse and cold storage for lettuce, cherries, melons, and citrus products.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to five (5) cold storage rooms, one (1) cherry hydrocooler, and up-to four (4) vacuum coolers. The ammonia system has two (2) high pressure receivers, four (4) BAC evaporative condensers, (1) plate and frame heat recovery unit, one (1) main suction accumulator, one (1) liquid transfer vessel, one (1) thermosyphon vessel, and six (6) screw compressors. A PLC has substantial control of the system.\n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows:  High pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to a main suction accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels. Operation of a float switch activated "

      "SummaryText": "solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction, and good industry practice.\n\n\n\nThe systems contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Lastly, emergency \"dump boxes\" contain switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Dresick Cooling consists of equipment, vessels, valves and piping which are interconnected. Therefore, the ammonia system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nDresick Cooling has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Dresick Cooling facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 40,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are ma"

In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDresick Cooling has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nDresick Cooling's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDresick Cooling has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Dresick Cooling continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Dresick Cooling's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Dresick Cooling's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nDresick Cooling has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Dresick Cooling has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Dresick Cooling now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Dresick Cooling employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Dresick Cooling will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
