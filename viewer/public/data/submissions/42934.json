We manufacture some of the finest turkey products in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. \n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains 17,205 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nCooper Farms has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.

The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression closed loop ammonia refrigeration system. The systems is installed to operate as a two-temperature single stage system. The compressors are split as High Stage and Low Stage Compressors. There exists, two different levels of saturated suction temperatures. Each level of suction temperature services a specific area of the plant. \n\nThe High Pressure Receiver HPR-1 provides a reservoir to store High Pressure Liquid (HPL) that is distributed to various parts of the refrigeration system requiring liquid. High Pressure Receiver HPR-1 also provides safe storage of a sizable amount of the liquid ammonia that must be removed from various parts of the system for pump out during maintenance and/or service. From here, liquid ammonia is routed via the LIC line to compressors HC-3, HC-5, and LC-4 for liquid injection oil cooling. Also, liquid ammonia is routed via the HPL line to the 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1 and the AUTO-PURGER PUR-1.\n\nThe 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1 provides the liquid separation from gas/liquid stream returning from High Temperature evaporators serviced by it while providing protection to High Stage Compressors from slugging with liquid. The 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1 also is equipped with controls to maintain a constant desirable liquid level, liquid ammonia is cooled to the temperature equivalent to the pressure maintained by the High Stage Compressors. From here, cooled liquid ammonia is routed to the -40\u00baF Low Temperature Recirculator LPR-1 to provide liquid makeup. The 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1 is equipped with two liquid ammonia pumps RP-1 and RP-2. One pump i"

The pump, which is running supplies cooled liquid ammonia to all evaporators associated with the 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1. The 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1 has associated with it a Transfer Vessel TV-1. The High Level Float Switch, when sensing a high liquid level, energizes a relay that interacts with the control system for Transfer Vessel TV-1 and causes it to start operating. The Transfer Vessel TV-1, can also be activated manually. This forces the excess ammonia collected out through a check valve to High Pressure Liquid (HPL) Main. Also associated with the 15\u00baF High Temperature Recirculator HPR-1 is an Oil Pot OP-1 that provides a convenient means to collect and remove oil from this portion of the refrigeration system.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nCooper Farms has had no accident(s) in the past five years involving ammonia.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify a member of management , who will immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC).\nIn the event that the ERC is unreachable, an Alternate should be contacted. The ERC or Alternate has complete authority to commit all available resources in the event of an emergency. In the event that none of the listed personnel are on-site, the senior management person shall direct operations until the ERC or Alternate arrives on-site. \n\nThe ERC and alternates are responsible for emergency response coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis.  Upon notification of an existing, or imminent emergency situation, the ERC will immediately identify the character, exact source, amount and extent (area) of the emergency.\n\nThe ERC will assess possible hazards both direct and indirect to human health, the environment and/or property both inside and outside of the plant.
