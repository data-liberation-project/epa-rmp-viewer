The RMP established \r\nthree levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that\r\npose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance\r\nrequirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest\r\nrequirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\r\n            \r\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\r\n         \r\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\r\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\r\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\r\n       Five-year accident history\r\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \r\n          \r\nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\r\n          \r\n       It stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity\r\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (residence)\r\n       It does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule\r\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM (this is a retail facility).\r\n\r\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary\r\nsource that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process,\r\nas determined under 40 CFR 68.115.  CARGILL stores more than the threshold quantity\r\nof anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds) for commercial sale as fertilizer.   Therefore,\r\nCARGILL is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in\r\n40 CFR 68.150 by June 20, 1999.\r\n\r\nThe CARGILL AgHorizions is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. \r\nEmployees involved in operating the ammonia storage and transfer facility are throughly trained\r\nto identify and understand the hazards"

Information includes\r\ninformation pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, process technology, process equipment, and\r\nemergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source is the CARGILL AgHorizions anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer\r\nfacility.  The facility has two stationary storage tanks with combined  capacity of 24,000 water\r\ngallons (112,000 pounds).  The facility also stores numerous smaller transportable tanks (nurse\r\ntanks) that are actually used in the fertilizer application process.         \r\n\r\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to\r\ndetermine program applicability.  CARGILL has chosen to use the DEGADIS+\r\nto determine offsite impacts.\r\nWorst-Case Scenario Parameters\r\n     1.   Land Use - Rural\r\n     2.   Release Qty - 112,000 lb \r\n     3.   Release Rate - 11,200 lb/min\r\n     4.   Release Duration - 10 min\r\n\r\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that a primary ammonia tank\r\nwould rupture and the entire contents would be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The\r\nworst-case scenario requires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  Release calculations are\r\npresented below:\r\n          \r\nSample Endpoint Calculation\r\n          \r\nGiven:         The Combined Tank Capacity is 24,000 water gallons\r\n                    ANSI K61.1 filling density = 56 % (of water wt.)\r\n                              \r\nRelease Rate   = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\r\n          = (24,000 gal * 8.345 lb/gal water)*(0.56)  / 10 min \r\n          = (200,280 lb)*(0.56) / 10 min\r\n          = 112,000 (rounded) / 10 min\r\n          = 11,200 lb/min \r\nInput of the preceding data into DEGADIS+ Comp program, the results indicate a worst-case\r\nimpact of 2.1 miles for the facility.

Alternative release parameters are presented below:\r\nAlternative Scenario Parameters                \r\n           \r\n    1.   Land Use - Rural                 \r\n    2.

Release Duration - 10 min\r\n      \r\nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release because of a\r\nsudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this scenario is still unlikely because\r\nthe transfer hoses used have multiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless\r\nsteel wire underneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it is\r\nmore likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  This scenario is also the\r\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\r\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\r\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, CARGILL\r\npersonnel will respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using \r\nthe OCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).             \r\n        \r\nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative release scenario impact \r\nof 0.23 miles for the facility. There are no residences located within 0.23 miles from the facility. \r\nIn fact, the closest residence is located approximately 0.4 miles away.  The amount of ammonia\r\nthat would have to be released to reach this residence is as unlikely as the worst-case scenario. \r\nThus, this alternative release scenario satisfies the conditions of \u001568.28.  There is no population\r\nimpact from the alternative release sc"

      "SummaryText": "enario.   \r\n \r\nThe facility maintains written process safety information to enable employees involved in\r\nhandling ammonia to identify and understand the hazards posed by this process.  Written\r\ninformation includes physical properties of ammonia, health risks associated with ammonia\r\nexposure, and material safety data sheets.  In addition, the facility has conducted and/or\r\nimplemented the following:\r\n          \r\n             hazards review\r\n             standard operating procedures\r\n             training program\r\n             maintenance program\r\n             compliance audits\r\n             incident investigation     \r\n       \r\nIn August of 1997, the CARGILL AgHorizions anhydrous ammonia facility reported release of\r\n400 pounds when a hose broke on a nurse tank.  No injuries were sustained in the accident.          \r\n         \r\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the hazard review which was\r\ncompleted March 6, 1999.  Recommendations were identified for two categories: Standard\r\nOperating Procedures, and Training.  Safety improvements will be investigated concerning their\r\nimpacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  Additional\r\nrecommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the hazard review is\r\nupdated every five years."
