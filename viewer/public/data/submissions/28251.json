Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nKoch Foods of Franklin Park recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\nTo accomplish Koch Foods of Franklin Park's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes governmental mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Koch Foods of Franklin Park's Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with Koch Foods of Franklin Park 's Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program.  These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). Koch Foods of Franklin Park 's General Manager and Maintenance Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may r"

Process Hazards Analysis:\nA formal analysis using the What-If/Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards.  For each Management of Change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\n4. Operating Procedures:\nWritten operating procedures have been developed that describes the steps to be followed to operate the refrigeration system safely.  Every Management of Change and any operation involving the refrigeration system that was not previously identified will have an operating procedure developed and implemented for the actions required.\n5. Training:\nA training scheduled has been established and implemented which ensures that all employees understands their responsibility during an emergency situation, whether its evacuating the building, responding to a release, or various other responsibilities during and after an ammonia release.  Additional training schedules have been established and implemented for the operators of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n6. Contractors: \nAll contractors will be screened and evaluated prior to any work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The contractors will also be periodically evaluated to ensure they perform their work duties safely.  All contractors that work on the refrigeration system will also be required to have an ongoing safety program that includes compliance to 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.134.\n7.

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility operates a [NAICS #49312 (Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage Facility)] freezer warehouse at 2155 Rose Street (25th Ave), Franklin Park, IL 60131.  An ammonia refrigeration system is in operation to maintain the storage, shipping, and holding temperatures in frozen perishable products.\n\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides cooling throughout the facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds to initiate OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Koch Foods of Franklin Park.'s maximum inventory in the refrigeration system is 15,000 pounds.  Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n1. Worst-Case\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 4,965 pounds of ammonia over a 3-minute period due to a failure of the Actuating High Level Cut-Out (AHLCO) in vessel IC-1. The maximum level of vessel IC-1 is limited to 72% of the vessel.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the ammonia could travel 0.60 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public (as outlined in the Risk Management Plan Guidance at the EPRG-2 of 0.14mg/L). The population impacted by the worst-case scenario is 4,721 residents and 2 schools, and industrial facilities.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\u00b7 Industry standards and qua"

Alternate Release Scenarios\nA. First Alternate Release Scenario \nThe release of 1,266 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period due to a puncture of a 1/2-inch {hi-pressure} schedule 80 pipe feeding an evaporator valve station on the roof with pumped liquid.  This scenario could occur during a maintenance procedure or unsecured equipment striking this line.  The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequence Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.2 miles. The population impacted by this scenario is 464 residents and surrounding businesses.\n\nThe alternate release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\n\u00b7 Koch Foods of Franklin Park has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\n\u00b7 The system was designed using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\n\u00b7 The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\n\u00b7 The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\n\u00b7 Low level controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the IC1 and/or LPRU1 acts as active mitigation before the release p"
