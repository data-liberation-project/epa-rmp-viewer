SI Group's commitment to prevention of accidental releases at its facility is inherent through all phases of manufacturing processes from maintenance, contractor and employee training, to design, installation, and operating procedures. SI Group's approach to chemical safety conforms to, or exceeds, federal and state regulations, as well as industry standards. In the event of an unforeseeable release, SI GROUP is committed to our on-site emergency response personnel and local emergency responding agencies to control and mitigate the effects of such a release. \n\n\n\nSI Group is a manufacturer of alkylphenols, phenolic resins, and industrial coatings. We currently have one (1) regulated substance at our facility, aqueous formaldehyde solution, which is used in our phenol-formaldehyde resin batch manufacturing processes. \n\n\n\nSI Group has developed a management system to comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM-29CFR Part 1910) regulations and the accidental release prevention requirements established under the Risk Management Program (RMP-40CFR Part 68). SI Group's prevention program contains all of the Process Safety Management elements which are in place in our facility, such as extensive recordkeeping, process hazards analyses of covered processes, safe operating procedures, extensive employee training programs, mechanical integrity programs, management of change procedures, pre-startup reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation programs, and contractor safety performance evaluation and training. SI Group has also incorporated numerous process controls and failsafe systems to significantly reduce the risk of an accidental release from its facility. Examples o"

In addition, much of our process equipment is computer automated.    \n\n\n\nIn the past five years, SI Group has not had any accidental releases of formaldehyde from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nSI Group has written an emergency response plan for guidance during an accidental release and other site emergencies. This plan is structured to provide for orderly transition from normal to emergency situations, assist in confinement of a fire or chemical release to its' place of origin, aid outside responding agencies in an emergency situation and inform employees and the public of hazards at the facility which may dictate an emergency situation. SI Group?s emergency response plan also includes other aspects of emergency response such as incident command structure, first aid, medical treatment, employee accountability, location and maintenance of response equipment, evacuations, and decontamination procedures. \n\n\n\nSI Group is continually improving operations and procedures to improve employee and plant safety. Some of the improvements currently in progress include implementing the Responsible Care program, upgrading existing storage tank facilities, and implementing a plant-wide management of change system."
