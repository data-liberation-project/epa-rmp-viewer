We believe all injuries can be prevented and expect all employees to assume the responsibility for working safely.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the plant safety program.  Nestle takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Engineering Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNestle's Laurel Plant produces ice cream and frozen desert products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the products.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 50,000 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Laurel Plant.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at the Laurel Plant involves the release of 10,300 pounds of ammonia due to the failure of a high pressure ammonia receiver. This maximum inventory reflects the written administrative procedures in place at the plant to limit the amount of ammonia stored in the receiver to 85% of its capacity.  Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud explosion could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario at the Laurel Plant involves the release of 3,600 pounds of ammonia over a 60 minute period from a pressure relie"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compliance Audit Proceduress\n\n\nE.
