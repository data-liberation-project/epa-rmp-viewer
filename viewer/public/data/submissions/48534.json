      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Bartlesville operates a water treatment plant located within the city limits in the northern portion of the city.  The plant uses chlorine to treat the city\u00bfs drinking water for the city.  The water treatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The maximum inventory is four tons and the treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to two.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the City of Bartlesville Water Plant is the release of a 1 ton cylinder resulting in an estimated Level of Concern [LOC] of 1.2 miles using the National Safety Council\u00bfs ALOHA mapping program. The first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] from the cylinder to the header pipe. This has an estimated LOC of 0.99 miles and a release of approximately 1,093 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. The second alternate scenario is a release representative of a culmination of both of the previous scenarios. This could occur if a tank ruptured and other tanks were able, due to failure of controls, to flow back along the header pipe and out the broken transfer hose [whip]. This would result in the release of approximately 2,930 pounds of chlorine and result in a LOC footprint of 1.4 miles. \n\nThe City of Bartlesville Water Plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance program to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility. Because of the strict implementation of the above-mentioned programs, this facility has not had a release within the last five years.\n\nThe City of Bartlesville Water Plant holds training and refresher courses for the personnel at the facility regarding the chlorine system and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). However, if an accident occurred, the City of Bartlesville Fire Department would be notified and would respond immediately. \n\nThe City of Bartlesville Water Plant has no cur"
