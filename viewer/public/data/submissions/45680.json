      "SummaryText": "The Dakota Premium Foods facility located in South St. Paul, Minnesota is a beef processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process live cattle into food products for distribution to retailers.  For this operation, refrigeration during processing and for storage of product is required.  To accomplish this, the plant has an ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAmmonia is contained in this equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  \n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  Ammonia properties result in an efficient and effective refrigeration system while operating at reasonable pressures. Ammonia can be detected at low concentrations in the air providing an early warning for correction to potential problems.  \n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.  \n\nAs a result of plant expansion a Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management (RMP) program has been implemented.  A safety program has been in place at the facility for some time with the intent of having the Corporate Safety Manager inspect the facility on a monthly basis.  An accidental release prevention program to satisfy both the PSM and RMP requirements was recently implemented.  \n\nThe facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is "

      "SummaryText": "in compliance with State codes.  In 1998 the entire new engine room was constructed.  Additional expansion resulted in removal of the prior engine room.  Also the evaporative condensers were replaced in that time frame.  The majority of piping has been replaced along with select refrigeration units in the plant and on the roof.  \n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program.   This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n?  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n?  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n?  The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n?  An process hazard analysis (PHA)) was conducted in January 2005.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The recommendations are being implemented on a time table.  An additional PHA was conducted in August 2005 in relation to an expansion.   \n?  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n?  For projects, a management of c"

Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n?  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon Federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The facility has an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency action plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency action plan has been discussed with the South St. Paul Fire Department.  Representatives of the South St. Paul Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis with the most recent being in October 2005.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
