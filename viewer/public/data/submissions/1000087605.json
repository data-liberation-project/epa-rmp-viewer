      "SummaryText": "Armacell, LLC, headquartered in Chapel Hill, NC, is a manufacturer of plastic foam products. Production at the Oklahoma City Plant began on June 13, 2005. These products are used in a variety of applications including packaging, pipe insulation, and assorted consumer goods. The company has a strong commitment to preserving the safety of its employees and surrounding communities, as well as minimizing impacts on the environment. As a result of this commitment, Armacell redesigned the manufacturing process of all of its plants to phase out the use of Hydrofluorocarbon-containing gases (HCFCs), which deplete the ozone layer. After much research, Armacell decided to replace HCFCs with Isobutane gas. Isobutane is used in the foam manufacturing process as a blowing agent. \n\n\n\nThe safe storage and handling of Isobutane are guided by specific procedures which address regular maintenance of the storage and handling equipment. In addition to procedures, a sophisticated gas detection system is used to continuously monitor gas levels. There are gas detectors located throughout the manufacturing facility as well as in product storage locations. The system signals facility personnel of any gas concentration release reaching 10% of the lower explosion limit (LEL). At 20% LEL and at 40% LEL, additional visual / audible alarms are activated (Details of the sensor and warning system are contained in Section 9 of the PHA Report). The risk of accidental release is therefore minimized, and there have been no reportable accidents at the plant since it began operations on June 13, 2005.\n\n\n\nArmacell has one (1) covered process (Isobutane) at the Oklahoma City Facility that is classified as a Program 3 processes and subject to the Program 3 prevention program requirements of the RMP rule. The Program 3 prevention program aligns with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard. The facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out unde"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Release Prevention Program that are in place at the Oklahoma City Facility.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nArmacell maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process. Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process,  technology of the process,  and equipment in the process. Examples of Process Safety Information include but are not limited to safety data sheets and piping and instrumentation diagrams. Process Safety Information is updated using the Management of Change (MOC) process.  Process Safety Information is available electronically on the Armacell internal server to ensure employee accessibility. This information informs employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the processes. \n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nArmacell has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of a PHA is to perform a systematic review of existing and/or proposed processes to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.\n\nArmacell uses one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n\n\n-What if\n\n-What If/Checklist\n\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n\n-Fault tree analysis or\n\n-An appropriate equivalent methodology.\n\n\n\nThe PHA is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as prevention and mitigation measures currently in place and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or miti"

Recommendations are reviewed by the Armacell Management Team and after approval, corrective actions are assigned and distributed to impacted personnel for follow-up.  \n\n\n\nAction items are tracked to closure to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA.  PHAs are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes and incidents that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for the process area, which address initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations,  normal shutdown and start-up following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. These operating procedures are stored electronically on an internal server for employee access and are periodically reviewed and revised. \n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nArmacell's Training program includes formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, and safety training. Each employee involved in operating a process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures developed for that process. The Safety Manager or their designee is responsible for scheduling and coordinating the following training for PSM/RMP affected employees.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  Armacell has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment.

The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed, the MOC is approved for change implementation.  Training requirements for affected personnel will vary depending on the significance of the change. For changes requiring significant updates to procedures or equipment, special training sessions (meeting the training requirements of the company's RMP/PSM programs) may be necessary for operators, mechanics, and/or contractors. For less significant changes, simply communicating information about the change and its anticipated effects on operation/maintenance may substitute for training sessions.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR) must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety process is used in conjunction with the Management of Change (MOC) process.  If the change triggers a PSSR, then approval for startup also requires satisfying the PSSR requirements. The PSSR process requires the appropriate personnel to field verify that the change was constructed and installed per the approved design and equipment specifications following the completion of the installation and prior to startup.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nThe Armacell RMP/PSM program is audited every three years and includes verification that the procedures and practices that have been developed to comply with the RMP Prevention Program and PSM regulations are adequate and being followed.   Compliance audits are"

The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Armacell Management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked to closure.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on the internal server.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nAn incident investigation must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in the catastrophic release of a regulated substance in a covered process. All incidents are reported and investigated according to the Incident Investigation Procedure. Results of the investigation and lessons learned are then shared with appropriate personnel to prevent future recurrence. Any corrective actions resulting from the incident investigation are tracked to closure.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nArmacell encourages participation in RMP/PSM through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses, incident investigations and compliance audits.  All new employees should be made aware of the RMP/PSM program as a part of the initial orientation process.  At least one hourly employee or a representative of the hourly employee, directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the site operations is represented in all meetings and/or formal discussions concerning RMP/PSM policies and procedures.

Armacell goes through a selection process prior to allowing contractors to bid work in the facility.  The facility obtains and evaluates information regarding the contractor's historical safety performance and current safety programs.   After contractor selection, Armacell informs the contractor of the potential fire and explosion hazards related to the facility operations, and routinely follow-ups with the contractor to evaluates the performance of the contractor work to ensure the contractor is meeting RMP/PSM and other safety obligations.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nArmacell has never had a significant release of hazardous substance defined by the RMP Rule for the covered processes. In the event of a release, Armacell has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP describes requirements that must be followed in the event that isobutane is released or if an emergency arises during maintenance of the storage and handling equipment for this substance.
