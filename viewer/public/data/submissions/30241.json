If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\u00b7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\u00b7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\u00b7 The maximum quantity stored would be 245,140 pounds in our 30,000 and 26,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n3. The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\u00b7 Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\u00b7 To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nC. A written emergency response"
