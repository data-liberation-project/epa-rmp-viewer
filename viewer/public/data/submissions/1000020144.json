This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Kenai Refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from raw crude oil.  The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as pentane, propane and butane.\n\nAs part of this 2011 update, Tesoro recalculated process volumes for the Crude Unit using detailed engineering calculations. In 2010, the crude unit was modified to remove additional benzene precursors in preparation for upcoming EPA Benzene Reduction Regulations. This was done using detailed quantities from our facility siting assessment and the RBMI (Risk Based Mechanical Integrity) program.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe original hazard assessment using both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario for the Kenai Refinery was reviewed to ensure all modeling inputs, including process volumes and composition, are still valid. The offsite consequence analysis was updated with a new alternative release scenario and to reflect current population estimates. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAt Tesoro we are proud of our safety performance.  The Kenai Refinery (Refinery) has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our ope"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Safe Work Practices are the what documents that address work place hazards while procedures are the how to documents that describe step by step the actions that must take place.  Examples of safe work practices include:\n(1)\tControl of the entry/presence/exit of contract personnel with a 24 hr. security staff;\n(2)\tA lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\n(3)\tA procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened;\n(4)\tA work permitting processes that controls ALL work activities within the refinery.  Hot Work activities are a critical component of this program.   \n\nThese safe work practices form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  All employees are included in the training of safe work practices.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Refinery is coordinated with local emergency responders, such as the fire department and the office of the Alaska State Troopers, as well as state and federal agencies.

Changes are reviewed to:\n(1)\tEnsure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards;\n(2)\tVerify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change;\n(3)\tAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes; and\n(4)\tOperating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably had the potential to have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release, that could have caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

One reason for our success at preventing accidents is that we investigate even minor incidents promptly and thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  Thus, we can eliminate many incidents before they become problems.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai Refinery (Refinery).  This program includes the required elements of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  \n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmployees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery Safety Program.  \n\u00c2\u00bf\tRegularly held safety meetings in each department are one way in which employees are able to participate in the review and development of programs and work practices. \n\u00c2\u00bf\tTesoro also started a (volunteer) behavior based safety program called the Eagles which audits regularly for behavioral based safety issues.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA Employee Safety Steering Committee was established to promote employee feedback and participation.

The documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Refinery has developed procedures for operating the process within safe limits for temperature, level, composition, etc.  The Refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure"

Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  They are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThe operating procedures at the Refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit variances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on computers located in the control rooms and in hard copy for all emergency procedures.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or working within a PSM-covered process.  New employees receive 40 hours of EHS  basic training.  Personnel in refinery operations receive an additional six weeks of job-specific training.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-related duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Before operating in a process operators must be certified by demonstrating adequate skill and knowledge in that specific process.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted routinely with the maximum time frame to be at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  All refinery employees are trained on Safe Work Practi"

This is referred to as the EHS Day of Training.\n\nContractors\nThe Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Refinery has Safe Work Practices in place to ensure that contractors: \n(1)\tPerform their work in a safe manner;\n(2)\tHave the appropriate knowledge and skills;\n(3)\tAre aware of the hazards in their workplace;\n(4)\tUnderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\n(5)\tUnderstand and follow site safety rules; and\n(6)\tInform Refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with a comprehensive, instructor based orientation that reviews the following:\n(1)\tA Process Safety Management overview;\n(2)\tInformation about safety and health hazards;\n(3)\tEmergency response plan requirements and muster points;\n(4)\tSafe work practices prior to their beginning work;\n(5) General rules and guidelines; and\n(6) Facility security.\n\nInformation is provided to contractors during the mandatory contractor orientation.  This orientation provides contractors with the general knowledge of the Refinery operations, its hazards, work practices, and evacuation procedures for emergencies.\n\nThe Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Tesoro Corporate has its refineries using PICS (Pacific Industrial Contractor Screening), a third party consulting company who evaluates and monitors contractor qualifications and safety records.  Contractors are to be approved by PICS before they enter the Refinery.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance through job site audits to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  The information and data from the audits is communicated"

The Eagles (behavioral based safety program) also do observations on contractors as well as have some trained observers in the Eagles program who are contractors. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe Refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  PSSR is integrated into the Modification or Change MOC program and is required for every MOC.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:\n(1)\tConducting training;\n(2)\tDeveloping written procedures;\n(3)\tPerforming inspections and tests;\n(4)\tCorrecting identified deficiencies; and\n(5)\tApplying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed and resolved by local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.
