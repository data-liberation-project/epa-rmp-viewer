The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n     \u00b7Increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergencyresponse    and mitigation procedures when handling an acutely hazardous material (AHM).\n\n      Assist N&H Enterprises and the local governmental agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling an AHM.\n\nThis document addresses the existing AHM system used for the produce refrigeration process at the N&H Enterprises facility.  The AHM used at the facility and for the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The devices that circulate and store the ammonia will be the subject of investigation throughout this RMP document.\n\n     N&H ENTERPRISES  is located within the city limits of Oxnard, California, in a predominately business/industrial area, and is a produce pre-cooling, cold storage, and shipping facility.   The facility was first constructed on this site in the late 1970's and has been in continuous seasonal operation since that time.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the single pre-cooling vacuum tube equipment at a amount of approximately 1550 lbs., and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site.   The balance of the facility located on the approximate 5 acre site consists of  7,500 sq ft of Freon cooled cold storage warehouse, which is not required to be addressed in the RMP, and related office space.   \n\n     The risks to the community from this facility would come"

      "SummaryText": "from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the vacuum tube refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.   In the worst-case scenario the toxic end point is located off the property within the community, the alternate release scenario was selected as the most likely event that could have a toxic endpoint located off of the subject property.   Events, which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Review were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, and acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n\n       The worst-case release scenario considered was as required, specifically being the release of 100% of the ammonia contained within the largest vessel over a 10-minute period.   The analytical results of this scenario show a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately .87 miles, which includes mainly industrial development, agricultural land, and a smaller amount of residential area.   The alternative release scenario chosen as the most likely event involves the release of 300 lbs. of ammonia over a 30-minute period from a leaking valve or cracked pipe.   The distance to the toxic endpoint would be approximately .1 miles in this case.   Both scenarios can result in off-site impacts.\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases is addressed by the following:\n               1.   System design and construction\n               2.   Administrative controls\n               3.   Trained operators on-site daily\n               4.   Off-hours security service\n               \n Administrative controls and policies to be used in the event of a release are contained in the existing \" Hazardous Materials Management Plan - 1999\", and the \"Emergency"

The essential risk reduction steps now in effect at this facility are:\n               1.   Regular daily equipment observations\n               2.   Maintaining equipment maintenance records\n               3.   Maintaining records of previous releases/causes           \n               4.   Proper training of operators\n               5.
