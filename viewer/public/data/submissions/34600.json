      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThe management of the Saint-Gobain Ceramics - Bororn Nitride facility is committed to operating the plant in a safe manner to protect our employees, the public and the environment. The plant has operated at the Audubon Industrial Park site in Amherst, New York, since 1987.  \n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the manufacture of boron nitride powders and formed products with applications in the microelectronics, semiconductor, manufacturing and cosmetics industries. The anhydrous ammonia is stored on site in a 10,000-gallon storage vessel.  The maximum volume to which the vessel may be filled is limited to 8,500 gallons (44,000 pounds).  This is controlled by means of liquid level indicators.  The facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule. \n\nNo History of Ammonia Releases, Preventive Measures Employed \n\nBoron Nitride has operated at this site since 1987 with no reportable releases of ammonia.  A variety of engineered systems, training programs, preventive maintenance activities and work practices are employed to minimize the potential for a release of ammonia.  The storage vessel meets or exceeds the design codes specified by OSHA, ANSI and ASME for anhydrous ammonia storage vessels.  The vessel was 100 percent stress relieved during manufacturing and is designed to reduce the potential for stress crack corrosion.  A containment dike that was designed to withstand Zone 1 seismic conditions surrounds the storage vessel.  Pressure relief valves have been installed to relieve excess pressure and prevent catastrophic failure.  In addition, the main ammonia supply piping to the plant contains an electrically operated, spring-closed emergency shut-off valve.  In the event of loss of power, compressed air or downstream ammonia scrubber control system operation, the main emergency shut-off valve automatically closes, terminating ammonia service to the facility.\n\nAmmonia is delivered to our site by tanker t"

      "SummaryText": "rucks.  A trained, experienced driver who remains with the truck throughout the procedure conducts offloading.  The tanker and the storage vessel are equipped with excess flow valves to prevent a major ammonia release if a hose were to rupture.  During the offloading process, the truck is parked in a loading station that drains to a secure secondary containment vessel. \n\nFacility maintenance personnel inspect the tank area, including the containment dike, at least once per day.  All maintenance personnel understand the hazards of ammonia, the function of the ammonia storage vessel and delivery system, the preventive maintenance program and the emergency action plan.  \n\nA review of several alternative leak scenarios indicated no off-site impacts.  We based our alternative scenario on a frequently occurring activity - ammonia delivery.  For this scenario, we assumed a leak through an excess flow valve for a duration of 10 seconds; actually, it would close in less than 2 seconds).  Using the EPA RMP*COMP model, no off-site impacts were predicted.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan In Place\n\nIncluded in the facility emergency procedures is an action plan in the unlikely event of an ammonia release.  Any leak that resulted in a continuous release of visible vapor or a liquid stream would require plant evacuation and notification to the local Erie County Emergency Response Team.  Plant personnel would pull an alarm box and evacuate to a point upwind of the leak point.  The ammonia supply to the building would be stopped by means of a remote shutoff.  The plant emergency controller would call 911 and report the location and severity of the leak.  The Erie County Emergency Response Team (ECERT) would take control of the site upon their arrival.  Facility personnel conduct annual evacuation drills.  The ECERT has also conducted drills at the facility to simulate a response to an emergency.\n\nThe facility Emergency Procedures are reviewed and updated annually.  The Process Safety Mana"
