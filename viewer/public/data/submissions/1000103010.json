The ultimate goal for Synear Foods USA\u2019s PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid adverse impacts to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.\n\nThe Synear Foods USA ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  The Synear Foods USA facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically outline requirements for the design and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  Safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the machinery room and production areas, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, and emergency stop controls.  The majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located in the machine room vessels and equipment.  All pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent to a water diffusion tank that is available to neutralize high pressure ammonia.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.

The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to address system heat load demands during operation.  The machinery room houses the compressors, recirculator and accumulator vessels, and auxiliary components, while the condensers and heat exchangers are located on the roof.  Some ammonia equipment is located in production areas.\n\nAmmonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to move heat from product, cold storage zones, and secondary coolants (glycol) to the outside atmosphere.  When heat is absorbed by the liquid ammonia, it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers, where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor, causing it to condense to a liquid.\n\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the ammonia system including:  ammonia leak detection, auto purger to remove non-condensible gasses, pressure relief system, refrigeration control system, and a water diffusion tank.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed for the Synear Foods USA facility to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequences of a significant release, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nPrograms developed for the PSM/RMP programs include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractor management, and incident investigation.

The facility is located approximately 2 miles south of State Highway 118 and approximately 0.4 miles east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard (SR-27).  The facility is approximately 8 acres in size.\n\nSynear Foods USA manufactures, packages, and distributes Chinese food products and uses the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system (closed-loop process) for product freezing, cold storage logistics operations, and process fluid (i.e., glycol) cooling.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 33,000 pounds.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\nFor example, all compressors are routinely inspected for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings are performed every 6 months on compressor motors;  the condensers are inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure receiver oil pots are drained, pump bearing wear is monitored;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year frequency.

To accomplish the company\u2019s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established safety programs that enable plant personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare plant personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\nThe Chatsworth facility draws from decades of internal experience and expertise, as well as resources of external consultants, to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the plant\u2019s safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA\u2019s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA\u2019s Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).
