The facility policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of  Pant Food Company Inc. are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of ammonium hydroxide.  If an\naccidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Cranbury\nTownship Emergency Response Coordinator, Fire and Police Departments, or other\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n  2. Facility information.\n\n       - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers.\n\n       - Ammonium Hydroxide is stored in two separate 10,000 gallon tanks, which are\nwithin an enclosed dike.  The dike would allow rapid recovery of any spilled or released\nammonium hydroxide liquid.\n\n       - The maximum quantity stored would be 150,000 pounds in our two-10,000 gallon\nstorage tanks.\n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one of\nthe 10,000 gallon storage tanks released as a liquid into the dike as a pool.  Ammonia gas\nwould then vaporize from that pool for 74.5 minutes, or a lesser time for complete\nrecovery of the liquid.  The maximum quantity released would be 75,000 pounds, which\nrepresents the volume of a 10,000 gallon storage tank.   The distance to the endpoint\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.20 miles.\n\n       b. The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a\nrelease from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 0.09 miles.\n\n  4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented an accidental release prevention program following\ngenerally accepted industry best management practices.  \n\n  5. The five-year accident history \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonium hydroxide in the past five\nyears that:\n  - have cause"

The emergency response program.\n\n  - The facility has a written Emergency Cooperation Agreement with the Township\nof Cranburys Emergency Response Coordinator dated February 20, 1995.\n\n  7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific \nammonium hydroxide safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
