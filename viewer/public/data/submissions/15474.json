This  commitment is demonstrated by  the  resources\ninvested  in accident prevention, such as training personnel\nand   considering   safety  in  the  design,   installation,\noperation,  and maintenance of our processes. This  facility\nwas  designed  and constructed utilizing generally  accepted\nindustry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI,  ASME\nand  API.   It  is  our policy to adhere to  all  applicable\nfederal,  state, and local laws. Our policy is to  implement\nreasonable  controls  to  prevent  foreseeable  releases  of\nregulated  substances.  However, if a  release  does  occur,\nplans  have  been  developed  to  control  and  contain  the\nrelease.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nThe  Crane gas plant is located outside of Crane, Texas  and\nprocesses  wet  natural gas to produce  a  dry  natural  gas\nstream,  natural  gas  liquids and a hydrocarbon  condensate\noil.  The  plant has several regulated flammables,  such  as\nmethane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.\n\nThe  wet natural gas from local oil and gas wells enters the\nfacility at pressures ranging from 5 psig to 600 psig.   The\ngas  is  compressed to 600 psig  via  six natural gas  fired\ncompressors. Condensate is produced as the gas is compressed\nand  cooled  via aerial coolers.  The gas then flows  to  an\namine system that is used to sweeten, or remove H2S and  CO2\nfrom  the sour wet natural gas. The sweetened gas then flows\non  to the Triethylene Glycol Contactor (TEG) contactor  for\ndehydration.\n\nAfter leaving the TEG contactor the gas flows to a molecular\n(mol)  sieve  bed system to accomplish the final dehydration\nbefore entering the cryogenic section of the plant.\n\nThe  sweetened, dehydrated gas is compressed via two natural\ngas  fired  compre"

The  gas  enters  the\ncryogenic  section  of  the plant and  is  cooled  by  cross\nexchangers,   a   propane   refrigerant   system,   and    a\nturboexpander.  The result of this process is that   natural\ngas  liquids  (NGLs) are removed from  the  gas  and  a  dry\nnatural gas stream is produced. NGLs, condensate and the dry\nnatural gas are delivered to local pipelines.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst case scenarios (WCS) associated with a release  of\nflammable  substances  at the gas plant  is  a  vapor  cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the  largest\npressure  vessel containing a flammable mixture  of  natural\ngas  liquids.  The maximum expected liquid inventory   of  a\n10,000  gallon pressure vessel, was assumed to  release  and\nignite,  resulting  in  a VCE. According  to  EPA's  look-up\ntables  the maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for  this\nWCS  is  0.3  mile.  Since this facility  is  located  in  a\nrelatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case  scenario\nwould not reach a public receptor. Although we have numerous\ncontrols  to  prevent  such releases  and  to  manage  their\nconsequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures  was\ntaken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis  facility complies with EPA's accident prevention  rule\nand  all  applicable  Federal, state  and  local  codes  and\nregulations.  This facility has training programs  in  place\nfor its personnel and a comprehensive maintenance program to\nensure  that the equipment is maintained properly to  reduce\nthe  possibility of a release of flammable liquids or gases.\nA  management of change policy is established that  requires\nall  facility  modifications to be reviewed by  engineering,\noperations and safety departments to promote the  safety  of\nthe employees and public.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe  Crane  gas  plant has an excellent record  of  accident\nprevention over the "
