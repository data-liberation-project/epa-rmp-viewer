Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems. \n\n \nThe following seven elements describe policies and activities at the Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant, which are consistent with and support the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program  regulation.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.\n\nThe Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant is committed to assuring that accidental release prevention is integrated into the design and operation of processes affected by the RMP rule.  This is accomplished by checking materials compatibility requirements, proper sizing and selection of equipment, providing procedures for monitoring key process conditions, employee training, conducting equipment inspections and preventive maintenance, maintaining communications systems, and observing site security and safety rules.\n\nThe Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant maintains  an Emergency Response Team, and emergency response equipment and supplies.  The Emergency Response Team meets regularly to review emergency response procedures and conduct drills. The supplies of emergency response equipment are inspected regularly by designated employees to assure availability and adequacy.\n\n2.

The plant has approximately 124 employees and operates 24 hours per day. There are two chemicals at the Farmers Valley plant that are subject to the RMP regulation: anhydrous ammonia and propane. \nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool the feedstock to the Deoiling Unit. The normal maximum inventory of ammonia is 19,000 pounds.\nPropane is also a colorless gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure, it is a flammable chemical with a vapor density of 1.52 (air = 1). Propane is used as a solvent to remove heavy resin from vacuum tower bottoms. The normal maximum inventory of propane is 184,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. Worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the Farmers Valley plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of each chemical covered by the RMP regulation. EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure. EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate. In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions. For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.\nThe Farmers Valley plant is also required to analyze the impact of alternative accidental release scenarios.\n As noted above, at the Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant the two chemicals which are subject to the RMP rule are anhydrous ammonia and propane. Ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical under the RMP rule and propane is classified as a flammable chemical.\n  \nWorst Case Scenarios\na) The worst case scenario for ammonia involves the failure of an ammonia storage tank containing 6,000"

This release of ammonia would have an offsite impact. \n\nb) The worst case scenario for propane involves the failure of a propane storage tank containing 93,000 pounds of propane, assuming the vessel is filled to its capacity. The entire contents of the propane tank are assumed to be released instantaneously as a vapor which would ignite. This release would have an offsite impact.\n  \nAlternative Release Scenarios\na) The alternative release scenario considered for anhydrous ammonia would involve the failure of a transfer hose being used to offload a tank truck of ammonia. The excess flow valve on the truck would automatically close and limit the amount of ammonia released. This release of ammonia would have an offsite impact.\n\nb) The alternative release scenario considered for propane involves a release of propane through a split in a transfer hose connected to a tank truck. The propane would ignite and this release would have an offsite impact.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Farmers Valley plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.\n  \n4a. Process Safety Information\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the processes which use ammonia and propane.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.  The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of ammonia and propane (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., process flow diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of the impact of exceedances), and data on the equipment"

Process Hazard Analyses\n\nProcess hazard analyses for the processes involving ammonia and propane have been completed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) (OSHA Process Safety Management).  These process hazard analyses are updated every five years. One or more of the following methodologies are used to complete each process hazard analysis: (a) what-if evaluation; (b) checklist; (c) hazard and operability study (HAZOP); (d) failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA); (e) fault tree; (f) process mapping, and; (g) cause and effect matrix.  Each process hazard analysis addresses the process hazards, process incident history, process control devices and detection systems, evaluation of failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors.  A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis performs each process hazard analysis.  The management of change process (described below) is used to track and document process changes, which occur as a result of recommendations from process hazard analyses.\n \n4c. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for  all processes at the facility, including those using ammonia and propane. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant.
