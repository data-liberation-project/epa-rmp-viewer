              "Description": "The ammonia neutralization process is a batch process in which phosphonates are neutralized with anhydrous ammonia (NH3) in a stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor) and an atmospheric vessel (blend tank).  The ammonia flow to the reactors and blend vessels is controlled so that almost all of the ammonia is reacted.  Any excess ammonia is vented to the plant scrubber system, where it is absorbed.  Safety relief devices are installed on the reactor to prevent catastrophic failure of the reactor should an unlikely overpressurization occur.  Overpressurization is not possible on the atmospheric tanks, so no relief system is necessary on the blend vessels.\nThe major bulk of the ammonia onsite is in the storage tank.  The storage tank is a 250 psig rated pressure vessel.  Safety relief devices are also installed on the tank to prevent a rupture of the tank that might be caused by an overpressurization.  The ammonia pressure at all ambient temperature conditions is well below 200 psig.  An excess flow valve is also installed between the tank and the plant piping that will stop the flow of ammonia from the tank as a result of a pipe failure or an excessive flow rate to the reactor or blend tank.  Check valves are also installed in the ammonia delivery lines to the reactor to prevent backflow of potential contaminants to the storage vessel.\nThe loading of the storage tank from a delivery truck is accomplished by used of a closed loop vapor recycle system in which the liquid ammonia is pumped from the bottom of the tank truck by a compressor to the bottom of the storage tank, and the ammonia vapro from the top of the storage tank is recycled back to the tank truck so that no ammonia is exhausted to the atmosphere.  The plant operator and truck driver manage the following:  the connection of the truck to the storage vessel; the unloading of the truck; and the uncoupling of the truck from the storage tank.  The plant operators and truck drivers have been trained and are experienced in the safe handling of ammonia.\nA process hazards analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the process from truck delivery to reactor operation and finished product.  Written operating procedures are in place to ensure on going integrity of the process equipment and piping.  Inspections include ultrasound thickness tests and visual inspection of glass lined reactors.  Leaking pumps, lines and valves are tagged and repaired by maintenance in a timely manner.",

              "Description": "The bisulfite process is analagous to the ammonia neutralization process in that it is a batch process where sulfur dioxide (SO2) is reacted in a pressurized, stirred tank reactor.  The reactor is protected by safety relief devices from a potential catastrophic failure caused by overpressurization.  The difference between the bisulfite batch process and the ammonia neutralization batch process is that SO2 is acidic and ammonia is basic.\nThe SO2 addition (flow) to the reactor is controlled so that it is almost completely reacted.  The reactor is first purged with nitrogen (N2) to remove any oxygen prior to the addition of SO2.  Any excess SO2 remaining after the reaction is purged to the plant scrubber system by N2.  The plant scrubber system supresses emission of SO2 to the atmosphere.  N2 is also used to purge the SO2 delivery lines from the reactor back to the storage vessel.\nLike the ammonia, the major amount of SO2 onsite is contained in the 250 psig rated storage vessel.  The SO2 is the storage tank is blanketed with N2 to exclude oxygen.  The N2 blanket pressure and ambient pressure of SO2 are well below the storage tank's rated pressure.  Like the reactor, the SO2 storage tank is protected from a potential catastrophic release by safety relief devices.  The tank is also inspected by an outside source every three years with the last inspection.\nLike the ammonia tank, the SO2 storage tank is loaded from a delivery truck by the used of a closed loop recycle system between the storage tank and the delivery truck to prevent emissions of SO2 to the atmosphere.  Plant process operators, supervisors, and delivery truck drivers have been formally trained in the safe handling and loading and unloading of SO2.  Operator training is conducted on a yearly basis.  A process hazard analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the SO2 storage and bisulfite batch reaction systems.",

(Champion), Odessa Plant, has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment.  This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important objectives.  Safety will take precedence over expediency or short cuts.  Champion intends to continue its complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management.  Champion believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChampion is a specialty chemical manufacturer of oilfield chemicals.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for our processes, which include anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).  NH3 and SO2 are regulated as toxic chemicals.  No regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\nThe maximum inventory of the aforementioned regulated substances is 93,000 pounds of NH3 stored in an aboveground storage tank.  The remaining quantity of regulated substance is as follows:  67,000 pounds of NH3, also stored in an aboveground storage tank.\n\n3.
