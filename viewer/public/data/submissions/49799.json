There are seven existing units at CCPP: Units 1-3 which have been retired, Units 4 and 5 which continue to operate as synchronous condensers for support of the regional transmission system, and Units 6 and 7 which continue to operate for electric power generation.  In 2001, Mirant began construction of a new combined cycle power generation unit (Unit 8) at the CCPP site.  In 2002, Mirant suspended construction activities associated with Unit 8 and the Unit 8 project was placed into a suspended status.  In 2006, ownership of the Unit 8 asset was transferred from Mirant to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and construction activities have been resumed by PG&E.\r\n\r\nMirant has retrofit the existing Unit 7 at CCPP with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as required to comply with Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 11, \"Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Electric Power Generating Steam Boilers\".  Mirant completed the SCR retrofit of Unit 7 in November of 2001.  At the time that the Unit 7 SCR system was designed and constructed, Mirant had planned to also retrofit Unit 6 with an SCR system.  Since that time, the project to retrofit Unit 6 with an SCR system has been cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe SCR technology utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from the generating units.  The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 29.4 % by weight.  This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both California and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was esta"

      "SummaryText": "blished in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The California Office of Emergency Services established the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The CalARP Program specifies the regulated substances, oversees the federal requirements, and determines the requirements for the preparation of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and offsite accidental release consequence analysis.  In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD).\r\n\r\nSince the quantity of aqueous ammonia that is stored and used at the Contra Costa Power Plant (CCPP) is greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities, a RMP is required.  As shown in this RMP, even a highly improbable worst-case release from the CCPP aqueous ammonia system will not cause the toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia (200 ppmv) to occur offsite.  In addition, the more stringent 30-minute Short-Term Public Emergency Limit (STPEL) proposed by the National Research Council (75 ppmv) will not be exceeded at any neighboring residences or businesses as a result of the hypothetical worst-case release.   Also, CCPP has not experienced any accidental releases during the last five years that caused an offsite impact.  Accordingly, this process qualifies for a Program 1 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations.  In order to fulfill the Program 1 requirements, the following actions were completed: \r\n\r\n    - Analyze the worst-case release scenario.\r\n    - Document that the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic endpoint.\r\n    - Document that no hazardous material accidents have occurred at CCPP in the past 5 years.\r\n    - Ensure that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.\r\n    - Certify in the RMP that \"no ad"

The location of the aqueous ammonia storage facility has been selected largely on the basis of safety considerations.  This location maximizes the distance from the property fence line, reducing any potential offsite impacts due to a spill, while minimizing the piping distance to the Units.  In addition, the location was chosen because of the facility area's low occupancy, its easy access for delivery trucks, and to distance the aqueous ammonia storage system from combustible equipment and minimize potential impacts to plant personnel.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia storage facility consists of a truck unloading station and three aqueous ammonia storage tanks.  The storage facility has been designed and constructed to receive and store aqueous ammonia for three different SCR systems: the Unit 7 SCR system that is currently in operation, a planned SCR system for Unit 6 that has not been installed and a SCR system for the new power generating unit (Unit 8) that has been transferred to PG&E's ownership.  At the present time, only the aqueous ammonia storage tank for the Unit 7 SCR system is in service.  The aqueous ammonia storage tanks that were installed for the Unit 6 SCR system and for PG&E's new power generating unit are currently empty.\r\n\r\nThe storage facility that currently services the SCR system for Unit 7 and that was designed for two additional SCR systems includes three 21,200-gallon capacity carbon steel storage tanks, approximately 10 feet in diameter by 38 feet long.  The effective maximum volume of each storage tank is limited to 20,000 gallons through administrative controls which include operating procedures that require a check of the storage tank level prior to filling the tank to confirm that the tank has sufficient free volume to accept the ammonia without exceeding 20,000 gallons.

The tanks have a maximum design pressure and temperature of 50 pounds per square inch  gauge (psig) and 120 F, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia tanks are supported horizontally on concrete foundations within a walled containment basin approximately 68 feet long by 44 feet wide, that slopes to a centrally located, covered sump beneath the tanks and running the length of the containment area.  This sump is 6 feet wide and 12 feet deep and provides a volume sufficient to hold 100 percent of the contents of one aqueous ammonia storage tank, plus the maximum rainfall recorded in 24 hours in the past 43 years (3.03 inches, WRCC 1955-1998).   Pumps for forwarding the aqueous ammonia to the SCR systems and for unloading aqueous ammonia from delivery tanker trucks are also located within the containment basin.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is delivered to the Contra Costa Power Plant via tanker truck.  Individual tanker trucks can transport up to 6,500 gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The concrete slab under the truck unloading station has been designed to contain the contents of one full truck and is sloped to quickly drain any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia into the central covered containment sump.  Each storage tank has an unloading station consisting of an ammonia fill line, where aqueous ammonia is fed from the delivery truck to the tank, and a vapor return line where vapor pressure between the tank and the truck is equalized.  \r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia is pumped through 3/4 inch stainless steel piping from the storage tanks to the SCR injection grid.

The portion of the piping that exits the covered trench and delivers aqueous ammonia to the SCR injection grid is contained within larger diameter PVC piping for all stretches as per the request of the Contra Costa Consolidated Fire District.  Therefore, secondary containment is provided for all sections of aqueous ammonia piping.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia delivery and injection facilities for the Unit 7 SCR system includes two aqueous ammonia feed pumps, ammonia vaporization equipment, and an ammonia injection grid.  In the SCR system, aqueous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank to spray nozzles inside the ammonia vaporizer unit that is mounted on the vaporizor skid near the SCR reactor.  The spray droplets are then mixed with a hot air diluent stream in the vaporizer to evaporate the ammonia.  The vaporizer produces a uniform distribution of gaseous ammonia in the diluent stream.  The diluent stream is then transported to the injection grid.  \r\n\r\nThe injection grid is located upstream of the SCR reactor.  This allows more thorough mixing of the ammonia-laden diluent stream with the turbulent flue gas from the boiler.  Although the oxidation-reduction reaction is initiated by the injection of ammonia at the injection grid, all of the reaction is completed in the SCR reactor by passing the mixture over a catalyst composed primarily of titanium and vanadium oxides.  The treated flue gas, containing a small amount of residual NOX and excess ammonia, is discharged out of the stack.\r\n\r\nThe SCR process is controlled with feed-forward and feedback control loops.  An upstream NOX analyzer measures the NOX concentration at the SCR reactor inlet.  A downstream analyzer measures the total NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet.

Aqueous ammonia is a corrosive material although the degree of danger associated with the substance is considered to be minor.  Ammonia is not a known carcinogen, but it poses acute and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards to the respiratory system and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards as skin irritations or other effects.  Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\r\n\r\nThough there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution, the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound also used for SCR systems.  The ammonia present will not readily vaporize if the solution is released to the atmosphere.  If the ammonia evaporates from the solution, the ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few parts per million volume (ppmv) and acutely toxic in high concentrations.  A one-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals.  According to the National Research Council, exposure at the 75 ppmv STPEL level \"should not result in serious effects, but would result in strong odor, lacrimation, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat), but no incapacitation or prevention of self-rescue.\"  \r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ignition.  Ammonia concentrations directly above an aqueous ammonia spill never approach these concentrations; therefore aqueous ammonia has no explosive flammability potential.\r\n\r\n1.5 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nSafety was the foremost consideration when designing the aqueous ammonia unloading and storage facility.
