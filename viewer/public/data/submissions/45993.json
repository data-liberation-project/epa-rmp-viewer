The facility employs 6 people at this location. Liquid chlorine is stored in the one-ton containers and chlorine gas is suctioned out of the containers using vacuum pressure generated by a flow of pumped water. Chlorine is mixed with water in order to disinfect it.\n\nThe Lake Havasu City Public Works Department Water Division has developed a risk management program to address 40 CFR Part 68 ?Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention? and to enhance already existing safety and emergency action programs. The Lake Havasu City Public Works Department is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The Lake Havasu City Public Works Department staff are highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine gas as a disinfectant.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Lake Havasu City Public Works Department Water Division has demonstrated a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine potable water disinfection system. The Lake Havasu City Public Works Department? policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Lake Havasu City Public Works Department Water Division uses chlorine gas to provide disinfection for the City?s potable water treatment processes. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers. All one-ton chlorine containers connected to the system are within a ChlorTainer secondary containment vess"

The chlorinators meter and inject gaseous chlorine into the raw water supply as it enters the Water Treatment Facility?s chlorine contact basins.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per 40 CFR 68.25 regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity, over a ten (10) minute period. The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by 40 CFR 68.22 regulations. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance. The results show the off-site areas that will be affected. This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp. For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of chlorine calculated to be released is located in the Hazard Assessment report located at the facility. The results can be found in the RMP*Submit electronic submission.  The meteorological conditions specified by regulation 40 CFR 68.28 for alternative release scenarios were used. The EPA?s own RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of gaseous chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scena"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and release of chlorine would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine release:\nChlorTainer, secondary containment vessels are used for all one-ton chlorine containers\nThere are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\nThere are chlorine sensors in place to allow early detection of a release.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this EPA Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by The Lake Havasu City Public Works Department Water Division to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine disinfection. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.
