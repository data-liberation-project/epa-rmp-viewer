      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy is an ethanol production facility located at 4895 Pembroke Road on the southeast side of Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  The facility began production in the spring of 2004.  \n\n\n\nThe facility produces approximately 10 million bushels of corn & wheat grown within the Hopkinsville area.  Annually the plant produces 33 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol plus another 100,000 tons of distiller's dry grains (DDG'S).\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy is subject to RMP regulations due to the storage of ammonia in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nChemical Management Program\n\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Commonwealth Agri-Energy is located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  The facility is operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  The plant's safety program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Commonwealth Agri-Energy's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Environmental and Safety Coordinators.  Additionally, regular safety meetings are conducted to discuss a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training issues.\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy currently has one (1) process that contains a regulated substance covered by EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 (anhydrous ammonia).\n\n\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is used to control pH in initial stages of the ethanol production process.  Ammonia is added to a tank wher"

      "SummaryText": "e it is mixed with corn slurry.  The ammonia is liquefied by pressure and stored in an 18,000 gallon aboveground storage tank located between the ethanol production facilities and the ethanol storage tank area.  Ammonia is conveyed to the slurry tank through a 1-inch steel pipe at a distance of approximately 256 feet.\n\n\n\nThe tank and piping system are equipped with several safety devices to mitigate an accidental release.  The primary safety devices are excess flow valves that are designed to automatically close and prevent excessive release of ammonia from the storage tank.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Release Scenarios\n\nThis information is being withheld due to security concerns.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The elements of the PSM program include:\n\n\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy's PSM program includes the following elements:\n\n-Process Safety Information,\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis,\n\n-Operating Procedures,\n\n-Training,\n\n-Mechanical Integrity,\n\n-Incident Investigations,\n\n-Compliance Audits,\n\n-Management of Change,\n\n-Pre-Startup Review,\n\n-Contractors,\n\n-Employee Participation, and\n\n-Hot Work Permits.\n\n\n\nAs part of the release prevention program, the system is equipped with relief valves and safety systems designed and installed in accordance with industry standards.  These systems are designed to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  Commonwealth Agri-Energy also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its system components to ensure they are in good operating condition.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving ammonia at this facility since production began. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy has implemented an Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.

In addition, Commonwealth Agri-Energy conducts emergency response refresher training for plant personnel on an annual basis."
