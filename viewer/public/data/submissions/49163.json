The Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at the facility. Company policy and procedures are strictly followed when handling and storing NH3.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe NH3 plant is located in Boyd Kansas, which is located four miles west of Hoisington Kansas. The town of Boyd has been unpopulated for a number of years. Only one house remains directly north of the facility. The Facility has two tanks, one 30,000 gallon and one 11,000 gallon. The total storage capacity is 41,000 gallons.\n\n3. The Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 131,070 pounds in a ten minute period or 13,107 pounds per minute with a 2.41 mile endpoint.\nThe alternate release could involve a transfer hose rupture which would result in a release of 1450 pounds per minute in a 2 minute period with a .47 mile to endpoint.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention\nThe Great Bend Coop recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by State and Federal Agencies and has annual training for the employees. The most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers: An example would be a nures trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Great Bend policy is not to fill above 85%.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nThe Great Bend Coop has an Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, and a Safety Director. All areas have worked with the County, City and Insurance Loss Control Department for the development of these plans.\n\n7. Planned Safety Changes\nThe Company Safety Director, Operations Manager tour the Branch once per month. All areas are toured once"
