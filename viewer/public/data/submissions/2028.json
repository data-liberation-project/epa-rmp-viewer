As of late as 1975, the PWSB built a new chemical storage building to house all its chemicals, with spill containment, and audible alarms. On site are sorted containment booms, Soda Ash to naturalize acids, Citrate of Soda to neutralize high PH chemicals, and speedy dry for dyking spills. Chlorine sniffers monitor the rooms air quality 24 hours a day, if the sniffer detects 1 part per million, ( PPM ), or greater it generates six alarms on the premisses, two audible outside, two audible inside, and two flashing  red strobes outside.\n\nIn October of 1997 the PWSB completely rebuilt and replaced its chlorination system. The entire system was switched from a pressure vacuum system, to a complete vacuum system, therefor eliminating 99% of all pressurized piping and related equipment. New vacuum check units were installed on our 1 ton chlorine cylinders. These regulators reduce the pressure from the cylinders and allow it to leave only as a vacuum. These units also incorporate double check valves to stop the flow of gas if it sees a drop in vacuum. Each unit is tied into an outside air intake manifold designed to take in outside air under high vacuum conditions, or relieve high pressure.\n\nThe PWSB has always maintained a high degree of skill and integrity in maintaining all its chemical systems, and will continue to do so in the future.",

This P.W.S.B. policy dictates that its facilities identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, and to reduce the risk to its employees, the community, and the environment through implementation of inherently safer technology, and procedures. The P.W.S.B. stresses safe and environmentally sound operation in employee training programs. The P.W.S.B. along with the City of Pawtucket, have formed safety committees to address safety concerns of its employees, and surrounding communities. The P.W.S.B.  staff has written a standard operating procedure manual which is avlable to all employees on the safe handling of chemicals in the work place, along with all material safety data sheets. The P.W.S.B. conducts safety and environmental audits along with local and governmental agencies. This risk management program document has been prepared to meet the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program regulations as stated in 40 CFR 68 (\"RMP Regulations\")"
