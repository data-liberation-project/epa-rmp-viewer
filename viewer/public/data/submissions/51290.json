The City of Athens operates a Surface Water Treatment Plant designed to produce up to 6 million gallons of potable water a day.  The facility is located at 4663 FM Road 2892 and draws water from Lake Athens.  The Surface Water Facility is in operation up to 24 hours a day year round depending on demands loads and peak periods.  The location was design engineered to meet all State and Federal requirements which will insure the safety of the public and the operators.\n\nThe potable water treated by this facility must meet parameters set forth by the State of Texas.  The design of Athens facility requires the use of chlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5) for disinfection purposes.  Threshold quantities outlined in 40 CFR Part 68 apply to the chlorine stored and used at the Surface Water Treatment facility.  Chlorine is a toxic oxidizing substance which is routinely used in small measured quantities for disinfection.  Disinfection is the most important process in the treatment of safe drinking water.  In its natural state, chlorine, exists in the form of a gas which is heavier than air.  Thus when released, it will expand 400 times, and will accumilate in low areas and remain there until dissipated.  However, Chlorine is stored under pressure where it exists in a liquid state.  It converts back to a gas when it comes in contact with the atomosphere.\n\nThe Surface Water Treatment facility stores and uses chlorine gas in individual 1 ton ASME coded containers.  The National Chlorine Institute set guidelines for the design of the holding area and transfer devices.  Regulating devices are attached directly to the chlorine cylinders and are designed to shut down if a major leak occurs in the distribution lines and piping.\n\nState Certified personnel operate and manage this facility.  All operators receive required training and updates in the safe handlin"

Personnel also receive required training in emergency procedures and safety management along with Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) interpretation and implementation.  A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is available at all times and each operator receives training and are required to demonstrate the donning of the SCBA.  Annual inspections of this facility are preformed by the City of Athens Fire Department.  A copy of  the City of Athens Emergency Response Program is on file with the Henderson County Emergency Response Coordinator.\n\nThe history of safety related accidents occurring at the Athens Water Treatment facility is untarnished.  The safegaurds and protection systems built into the facility along with the knowledge and training received by the operators suggests that any type of accidental release involving chlorine would not likely cause negative offsite consequences.  The City of Athens will continue to take all necessary steps to insure the safety of its citizens and to provide clean and safe drinking water at all times."
