      "SummaryText": "ARMALY SPONGE COMPANY - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nArmaly Sponge manufactures sponges for household and commercial cleaning purposes.  The sponge material is produced on a slab-stock line from urethane based resins. The cured sponge material is subsequently cut to size, processed and packaged for shipment.  As part of the sponge manufacturing process Armaly utilizes two toluene diisocyanate (TDI) isomers as catalyzing agents in the sponge foaming process: toluene-2,6-diisocyanate (TDI-2,6) and toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI-2,4).  Depending on the material being produced, one of the TDI isomers is metered through a pump directly into the foam mixing chamber.  In the mixing chamber it reacts with the polyurethane components to produce the finished slab product.\n\nEach of the TDI isomers utilized by Armaly is listed as Regulated Substances under 40 CFR Part 68 and must be evaluated under the 112(r) Risk Management Program.  Each isomer is stored in a maximum quantity of over 50,000 pounds, and is considered its own process as defined in 40 CFR 68.  Armaly Sponge is subject to Program 1 requirements.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES & PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nArmaly Sponge places the health and safety of all employees as its number one priority and has therefore established a proactive approach to chemical process safety.  The policies developed are designed to investigate, evaluate, review, inform, and educate employees regarding the use of all onsite chemicals.  \n\nThe facility has a Hazard Communication and Chemical Safety written plan that is part of the facilityA?s emergency response program and which provides detailed safety and emergency response policies of the Company.  Furthermore, part of the CompanyA?s chemical safety program utilizes OSHAA?s process safety management (PSM) practices, along with industry-specific guidelines.  The combination of these two elements, as well as regular informational updates of industry specific practi"

      "SummaryText": "ces and technologies regarding the use of TDI, helps ensure the prevention of accidental releases.\n\nGENERAL AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe TDI storage tanks are located in a Chemical Room, a 2,400 square foot room containing all chemicals used in the foaming process.  Segregation of chemicals into a separate room within the facility is the first step in ensuring that all chemicals are handled in a safe manner.  Furthermore, the TDI tanks are surrounded by a dedicated secondary containment wall designed to hold the entire contents of both storage tanks.  Therefore, should a release of TDI occur, the release would be contained not only within the Chemical Room but within the secondary containment.  Use of the containment allows for mitigation of the release with minimal potential harm by limiting the area of the release and exposure to the responders.  In such an instance the emergency response team need not enter the building initially; a suction hose could be placed into the containment area via an access port and the chemical pumped out and into an awaiting tankwagon.  Subsequently the area would be sprayed with a neutralizing agent and the remaining clean-up accomplished with minimal risk.\n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS & FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nArmaly believes that chemical safety management is an ongoing process.  The Company plans to continually educate itself on ways to improve process safety management practices, and pass on this knowledge through active employee training.  It is ArmalyA?s plan to continue with a four-step training program, requiring chemical safety training as follows: Initial Orientation Training for new hires, Job Specific Training for the proper use of any personal protective equipment and specific chemical training based on their job, Annual Refresher Training for hazard communication, and On-the-Spot Training, conducted as requested or for any employee demonstrating a lack of understanding of the chemical or safety requirem"

Armaly Sponge has had no accidental releases of a regulated substance (i.e., TDI) within the past 15 years.\n"
