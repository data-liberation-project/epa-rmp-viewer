It is equipped to store a maximum of 24 one-ton chlorine containers, twelve of which are stored within the building and are connected to the chlorination system, and twelve of which are stored outdoors.\r\n\r\nSix chlorine containers sit atop a series of three hydraulic load scales while six are stored on floor level trunnions. Each scale weighs a pair of chlorine containers and is connected to one wall mounted scale dial. The scale dial provides a localized readout and enables the Operator to continuously monitor the available chlorine remaining in the containers.\r\n \t\r\nThe chlorination system is designed to allow to manifold twelve, one ton chlorine containers at a time, which are ready for service (connected).

At this point, chlorine is supplied under pressure to one 10,000 lb./day, cabinet mounted, V-Notch Chlorinators. Each chlorinator contains a pressure regulating valve, a flow meter, a variable metering orifice, and a vacuum regulating valve. The vacuum regulating valves are the demarcation between the pressurized portion and the vacuum portion of the chlorine supply system. The valves greatly reduce the length of pressurized pipe and enables a large portion of the chlorine supply to be automatically shut-off by the closure of a vacuum-activated, spring loaded valve if loss of vacuum occurs for any reason.\r\n\r\nFive of the chlorinators supply chlorine gas to the ejectors. The remaining five chlorinators produce concentrated chlorine solution which is piped to various application points throughout the plant.\r\n\r\nFour ejectors are used to create a vacuum and pull chlorine gas into the vacuum regulating valves, through the chlorinators and into the ejector bodies. At the ejectors, the chlorine dissolves into water to form hydrochloric acid and flows through four three-inch diameter chlorine solution pipes to the Injection Building for application to the WWTP effluent prior to the chlorine contact tanks.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine system is under a vacuum from the ejector to the vacuum regulating valve of the chlorinator during operation. If the water supply to the ejector is stopped, or the operating vacuum is lost for any other reason, the spring-loaded vacuum regulating valve immediately closes to isolate the chlorinators from the gas supply. If the source of chlorine gas is exhausted, the valve closes to prevent excess vacuum levels from developing in the chlorine piping.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum gauge, pressure gauge, and chlorine gas flow meter, which are mounted on the front of each chlorinator cabinet, enable the operator to determine application characteristics and make adjustments."
