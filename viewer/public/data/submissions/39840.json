If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impace of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The primary activity at the facility, which is located at Route 45 South  Metropolis,IL,  is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1 storage tank (30,000 gallons), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.    Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 320,000 pounds. This includes anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulation.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n4. The following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at the facility:\n    -  We had an accidental release of over 750 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on July 5, 1999.  A garden\n hose was attached to a valve with duct tape and the valve was opend, the duct tape did not hold and  the hose blew off, releasing"
