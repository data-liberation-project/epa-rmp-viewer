      "SummaryText": "27640   LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nThe Praxair Distribution facility at Taft, Louisiana is an industrial gas plant that produces, handles and/or stores the following substances that are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule, in excess of their threshold quantity:\n\n7 Acetylene; and\n7 Ethylene.\n\nThe primary source of acetylene gas at theTaft facility is by pipeline from a nearby chemical plant.  The acetylene is a byproduct of a chemical production process.  If necessary, the Taft facility also has the capability to generate acetylene by reacting calcium carbide and water.  The acetylene gas is purified and then compressed into specially designed acetylene cylinders on flatbed.  On an acetylene trailer, the individual cylinders are connected by a piping manifold, which allows acetylene gas to be withdrawn from the entire bank of cylinders.  These acetylene trailers are then transported as a unit to our customers throughout the country.  Acetylene is listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The acetylene process at the Taft plant contains up to 32,000 pounds of product, and therefore is subject to the RMP rule.\n\nThe Taft facility receives ethylene gas by pipeline from the same nearby chemical plant.  The ethylene gas is purified and compressed into tube trailers, which are banks of high pressure steel containers mounted on a truck frame. The individual tubes are connected by a piping manifold, which allows ethylene gas to be withdrawn from all of the tubes.  The tube trailers are then transported as a unit to customers throughout the country.  Ethylene is also listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The ethylene process at the Taft plant contains about 15,000 pounds of product, and therefore is subject to the RMP rule.\n \nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report one Worst Case Scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario that represents all regulated flammable substances at the Taft facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Taft facility, the Worst Case Scenario involving a regulated flammable substance would be the failure of an ethylene tube trailer, which holds about 15,000 pounds of product.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.20 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nWe are also required to report an Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario,  for the flammable processes at Taft.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the flammable processes at the Taft facility, a credible release would be a process piping failure resulting in"

      "SummaryText": "an acetylene gas release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as a joint or a valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the Taft facility, a release of this type could result in the released gas igniting, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoint of 1 pound per square inch overpressure is 0.05 miles, or about 264 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\" \n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Taft facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n7 Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n7 Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling flammable substances;\n7 Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and\n7 Maintenance programs and procedures to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nAs a result of our process safety and risk management practices, the Taft facility has not had an accident involving any of the RMP regulated substances on-site in the last five years.  In the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.  All facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency action plan, and Praxair policy requires that"
