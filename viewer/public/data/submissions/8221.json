The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute recommendations, as well as Federal, State and County guidelines.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and other regulatory agencies, who would in turn notify any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat water for potable use.  Chlorine is brought by truck in one-ton containers and in 150 lbs cylinders.  Up to twelve one ton cylinders and 20 150 lbs cylinders are kept in the storage yard adjacent to the main facility.  Two one ton cylinders are kept in the chlorine room.\n\nFailure of the largest container when filled to the greatest amount could release 2350 pounds of chlorine.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 3.4 miles.\n\nBecause there are extensive safety features at the facility including vacuum regulators and automatic valves on the chlorine container heads, any loss of vacuum downstream would result immediately in shutting off the chlorine supply.  In such an event the maximum amount of chlorine release would be the amount in the five-eighth inch pipe which runs for five hundred yards.  This amount is fifteen pounds of chlorine.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative scenario is 0.1 mile.\n\nThis facility complies w"
