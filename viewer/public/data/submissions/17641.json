The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Edinburg Raw Water Pump Station #1 is located at 2100 West Sprague Street, in Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas.  A one 1-ton chlorine container with a tank mounted vacuum regulator is on continuous operation, while another 1-ton chlorine container is used as a backup.  The chlorine containers are situated outside, have manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency, and a chlorine alarm will trigger if a release occurs.  Emergency air supply and power are available for emergency situations.  The facility is checked by plant operators six times per shift or every four hours per day.  A Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is stored in the West Tower located approximately 65 feet from the chlorine containers.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Pump Station includes consideration of two different release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (chlorine): 1) A \"Worst Case Release\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA guidance which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The Alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\" \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by a parameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".  The toxic endpoints a"

The calculations were performed with the RMPComp32 model as provided by USEPA and NOAA.  The affected population was estimated through Tiger and Landview III information.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario at the Pump Station was defined by the following conditions:\n\nFailure of flexible connections (pigtails) connected to 1 one ton container resulting in the\ntotal release of 2000 pounds of chlorine (Pump Station);\n\nRelease of the entire amount as a gas in 30 minutes;\n\nUse of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as t"

Both of these entities are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually."
