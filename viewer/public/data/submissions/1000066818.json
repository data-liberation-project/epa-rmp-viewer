The RMP summaries the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that works together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n- Introduction;\n- Facility and regulated substances identification;\n- Hazard Assessment;\n- Prevention Program;\n- Five-Year Accident History;\n- Emergency Response Plan; and\n- Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nIntroduction\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Day-Glo Color. This RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Day-Glo Color is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Identification\nDay-Glo Color Corp. owns and operates a color pigment manufacturing plant in Twinsburg, Ohio. Cyclohexylamine (CHA), a regulated toxic RMP chemical substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 15,000 pounds, is used as an ingredient in the manufacture of color pigments. The maximum amount of CHA present in the system is approximately 30,000 pounds (4,200 gallons). The normal amount present is less than about 20,000 pounds (2,750 gallons).\n\nHazard Assessment : Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nThe worst-case toxic accidental release scenario assumes the entire contents of the single 7,500 gallon CHA storage tank are released into the storage tank containment dike and evaporates at a rate of approximately 10 lb./min. EPA's SLAB guidance shows that under the worst-case weather conditions the release could travel 0.4 miles downwind until the toxic endpoint is reached.\n\nHazard Assessment : Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nThe ARS f"

EPA's OCA Guidance show that this ARS release could travel 0.06 miles downwind until the toxic endpoint is reached.\n\nPrevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers the CHA component of the manufacturing process in which CHA is present above the threshold quantity for the RMP rules.\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the activities in the prevention program include:\nProcess safety information is provided to all employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\nProcess hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\nWritten operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators and updated as needed.\nTraining is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given annually or upon request.\nOperators, maintenance, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied for starting new or modified equipment.\nA program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process that includes written procedures, training requirements, work orders, and scheduled maintenance.\nA hot work permit system assures that welding, cutting, and grinding work is done safely and properly.\nA management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\nIncidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\nRoutine audits are conducted to assure safety"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are key elements in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents/releases of cyclohexylamine at the facility that led to on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage in the past five years. There are also no reported incidents of off-site consequences from an accidental release of cyclohexylamine.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nDay-Glo Color has an evacuation procedure to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel on-site know how to evacuate the area where the emergency is occurring. The procedure identifies assembly locations and a list of individual to be contacted in order to mitigate the effects of a release. Because Day-Glo employees will not respond to cyclohexylamine emergencies, response activities have been coordinated with the Summit County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Fire Department."
