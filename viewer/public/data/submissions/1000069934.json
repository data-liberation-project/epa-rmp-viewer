The PSM program is managed and administered through a team effort between Costco Corporate Depots and the local depot personnel. Periodic PSM Team meetings are held to review and update accidental release prevention programs. Safety issues associated with refrigeration is covered locally by the depot safety committee and or the management team. In addition to the PSM programs, general safety programs including forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Evacuation Plan, etc. are available and used to provide a safe work environment. These are also safety training topics for depot employees. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in August 1999.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 4000A 142nd Avenue E. in Sumner, Washington 98390, just east of State Highway 167.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses an inventory of 23,890 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations and warehouse cold storage with a maximum calculated intended inventory of 28,655 pounds.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  Fo"

Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including each ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment. This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on the five year accident history review, there have been no RMP defined reportable releases of ammonia in the last five years(May 2013 - May 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation rou"

This Plan is reviewed and updated as often as necessary.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, Costco Wholesale plans to evacuate all employees stationed in the cold storage warehouse and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  Costco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale is continually reviewing the ammonia refrigeration system against industry standards and has recently completed many recommendations to bring the system into compliance with current guidelines and standards. Through annual IIAR B109 inspections and PSM team meetings the company continues to evaluate opportunities for improvements. "
