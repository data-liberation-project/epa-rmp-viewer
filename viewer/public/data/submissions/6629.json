This vessel will be inspected on a scheduled basis utilizing an ultra-sonic testing method, which verifies the mechanical integrity of the tank.  The vessel is carbon steel and designed for 360 psig MAWP.  It is normally operated at 140 psig.  The worst case was developed using Class F atmospheric stability (1.5 m/s wind speed conditions) and does not account for any active mitigation measures.  Furthermore, we have not experienced an ammonia release from this vessel since initial startup.  Related data is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nRelease Rate -                                                      1,380 lbs./min\nDuration of Release -                                           10 minutes\nMeteorology -                                                       25 degrees C / 50% RH (Class F)\nOff-Site Consequence -                                        1.5 miles\nToxic Endpoint -                                                   0.14 mg/l\n\nALTERNATE CASE - AMMONIA:  This alternate case scenario involves a release from a pressure relief valve in an ammonia evaporator.\n\nRelease Rate -                                                      90.8 lbs./min\nDuration of Release -                                           26 minutes\nMeteorology -                                                      25 degrees C / 50% RH (Class D)\nOff-Site Consequence -"

Also, El Dorado Nitrogen Company parallels the RMP rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEl Dorado Nitrogen Company, Baytown, Texas, maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\".  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, El Dorado Nitrogen Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turn-around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nEl Dorado Nitrogen Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
