      "SummaryText": "It is the goal of the Campbellsville Water Treatment Plant to operate in a safe and efficient manner.  Chemical safety is just one of our safety issues addressed continuously.  Safety is stressed not only in departmental meetings but company wide safety meetings as well.  The Water Plant has written chemical handling safety manuals as well as written notification procedures in case of an emergency.  These policies and procedures are reviewed with all personnel in a timely manner.\n\nThe Water plant consists of a complex of four building located below the City Lake Dam on North Highway 289 (Old Lebanon Road).  The primary purpose of the plant is to provide clean, safe drinking water to Campbellsville and Taylor County.  In this process, chlorine, an extremely hazardous chemical is used for disinfection purposes.  Chlorine is stored indoors in a separate room form all other chemicals in 2000 pound cylinders.  The largest quantity stores at any one time on site is 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release of chlorine would involve the rupture of all five cylinders store on site from a fire melting the pressure plugs on each tank.  A release of this magnitude could affect an area in a 2.3 mile radius from the plant depending on wind direction and speed.  It should be pointed out that chlorine gas is heavier than air and tends to flow into the lowest places possible.  A chlorine release would probably travel down the Trace Fork Creek bed through Miller Park.  This scenario is highly unlikely to happen due to the storage area consisting primarily of concrete floors, concrete block walls and concrete ceilings.\n\nAnother possible release would be of 2000 pounds from one cylinder through tank rupture, valve stem breakage or transfer hosing rupture.  This could effect an area 0.9 miles from the plant.  Procedures in place make this likely not to happen.  These procedures include inspection off all tanks on arrival from the manufacturer, keeping covers on the tank valves when not in"

      "SummaryText": " use, No more than one tank on standby for the chlorinators to switch to as the in process tank empties and daily monitoring of the feed equipment and chlorine usage.  There is an alarm system installed to detect minute quantities of chlorine so repairs can be made before any major problems occur.  All valves and feeder systems are maintained and inspected  under a yearly service contract.  This includes cleaning, inspecting and replacing worn parts.  These procedures ar outlined in our operations manuals and process safety manuals.\n\nWe had a chlorine leak of approximately 30 lbs of gas on July 20, 2001.  It was contained and shut off by Campbellsville-Taylor county Rescue Hazmat Teams.\n\nThe Campbellsville Water Treatment Plant has coordinated with the Taylor County Emergency Planning  Committee and the Campbellsville Fire Department available through an enhanced 911 communications system.  Facility TAB-Q-7 plans and Tier II infromation has been filed with these agencies.  These plans include facility maps and chemical storage floor plans, quantities stored and detailed instructions on responsible charge personnel, possible affected areas and evacuation plans"
