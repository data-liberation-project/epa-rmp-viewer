Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods  - Cooked Products Division, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods - Cooked Products Division, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n       Tyson Foods Inc. Cooked Products Division is a further processing plant.  We receive a raw   \n       Product from other points and  when our process is finished, we ship a fully cooked (oven\n       roasted) ready to \"Heat and Eat\" product.  In the Process, we use  Ammonia Refrigeration\n       for controlling room temperatures as well as cooling finished products.  The Cooked\n       Products Divisions Refrigeration System maintains a maximum capacity of approximately\n       25,000 pounds of Ammonia. \n\n     \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  18,000\npounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This f"

      "SummaryText": "acility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 18,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.5 miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario i. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had no releases in the past 5 years of this type.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTYSON FOODS - COOKED PRODUCTS DIVISION\nWILKESBORO, NC\n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's         Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems. \n    Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators. \n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n\nThere have been no incidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\n6.
