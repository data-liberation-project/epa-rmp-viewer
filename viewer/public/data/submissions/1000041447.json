This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as\n\nrequired by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of\n\nthe current Risk Management Program and to describe further\n\nmeasures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of\n\nRS's.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region's Wastewater Treatment Plant,\n\nlocated at 2880 S. Fifth Ave., Oroville, CA in Butte County, uses\n\nchlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the\n\nFederal threshold quantity for this RS. The facility is located\n\nin an industrial area in Oroville. There are 8 full-time\n\nemployees at this site. Chlorine is received in ton containers by\n\ntruck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton\n\ncontainer scales inside the building. The chlorine is used for\n\nodor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the\n\nwastewater effluent, and for other process uses.

In order\n\nto accomplish this goal, Sewerage Commission Oroville Region has\n\ngathered safety information on chlorine and on the process,\n\nequipment, and procedures involving chlorine; performed a\n\nstructured assessment of hazards of the process and external\n\nevents which might affect the process; performed an offsite\n\nconsequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a\n\nwritten program for prevention and mitigation of accidental\n\nreleases; and established a written emergency response program\n\ncoordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be\n\nconsidered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum\n\ndistance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on the site\n\nabove the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in\n\nthe ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest\n\nsingle container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of\n\n10 minutes.
