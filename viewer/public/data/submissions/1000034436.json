Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  The facility is a distribution center that distributes dry grocery, perishable, and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to Kroger retail foodstores.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 37,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\n\r\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center facility involves the release of 17,500 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case weather conditions that were used for this scenario a"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nKroger Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.
