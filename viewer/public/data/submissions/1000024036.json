Senior management is committed to protecting the health of its employees and the general public and is actively developing comprehensive safety management plans to achieve these objectives.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSenior management at the facility are designated as having primary responsibility for ensuring compliance to applicable federal and state programs. The facility is managed in compliance with applicable regulations administered by the following agencies:\n\n- Federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA)\n- California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA)\n- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n- California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA)\n- California Health and Safety Code, and\n- United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nDODGE manufactures and distributes embalming fluids and chemicals for mortuary services. The Fontana warehouse stores finished products and distributes them to end-user clients. No manufacturing or repackaging of product is done at the warehouse.  The facility consists of a main warehouse, an administrative office area, a combustible/flammables storage room (H-3 occupancy rated), and a shipping receiving area (including a loading dock). Product containing formaldehyde is stored in the H-3 storage room. The warehouse operates one process that stores formaldehyde containing solutions: warehouse storage. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDODGE has put in place several measures that serve to prevent/mitigate the release of liquid formaldehyde in the warehouse and shipping areas. These include:\n\n- Fire extinguishers located throughout the warehouse and personnel have been trained on their proper use.\n- Personal protection equipment and spill kits are located throughout t"

The PHA was based on a what-if question checklist developed through brainstorming and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that hazards of this process were thoroughly reviewed. Hazards and applicable recommendations were developed and documented during the PHA. The recommendations for engineering and administrative (E/A) controls for these scenarios and others identified are documented within the PHA What-If Checklist and are included in the facility's RMP documentation.\n\n\n"
