      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nIt is the policy of Saranac Cogeneration Plant to maintain accidental release prevention and emergency response policies in order to protect human health and the environment. A Risk Management Program (RMP) has been implemented at the Saranac Cogeneration Plant for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. This RMP documents the safety equipment and procedures used to ensure the safety of Saranac employees and its surrounding neighbors. Saranac is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Falcon Power Operating Company operates the Saranac Cogeneration Project in Plattsbugh, New York. The facility generates electrical energy and steam for sale. One process on-site uses a substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP); the selective catalytic NOx removal (SCR) systems. Aqueous ammonia (30%), a regulated toxic RMP substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 20,000 pounds, is used in the SCR system to remove NOx emissions. The amount of ammonia present in the system is approximately 31,000 pounds.  \n \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers the aqueous ammonia component of the SCR process in which ammonia is present above the threshold quantity for the RMP rules. \nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n? Process safet"

Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n? Training is provided to all affected employees upon hire, and refresher training is given annually.\n? A maintenance program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes\n  written procedures, training requirements, scheduled and corrective maintenance.\n? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents/release of aqueous ammonia at Saranac which led to on-site deaths, injuries or significant damage in the past five years.  There are also no reported incidents of off-site consequences from an accidental release of aqueous ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nSaranac has an emergency response plan to ensure that in the event of an emergency the personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release.  Response activities are coordinated with the Plattsburgh Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNone currently planned."
