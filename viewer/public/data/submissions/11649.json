(TransCanada) Mermentau Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The TransCanada policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTransCanada owns and operates the Mermentau Facility located in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana. The Mermentau Facility is a barge loading facility capable of storing and loading natural gasoline and butanes pipelined to the site.\n\nThe Mermentau Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TransCanada identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Mermentau Facility are natural gasoline, isobutane and n-butane.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed threshold quantity.\n\nTransCanada has determined that natural gasoline has an National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analysis of flammables, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  However, the Mermentau Facility is subject to a portion of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) and does not meet Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes listed in the rule.  Therefore, "

      "SummaryText": "the Mermentau Facility is classified as a Program 2 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  n-Butane is the worst-case flammable release with a 1.17-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for n-butane as follows.  Seal failure on the n-butane product pump causes a release from a one-inch opening at 50 psig (suction pressure) and 700F.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.  The n-butane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for n-butane.  The alternative-case release of n-butane resulted in a 0.07-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.06 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Mermentau Facility does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Mermentau F"

Because the Mermentau Facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation as a Program 2 process, it is also subject to a portion of the OSHA PSM standard prevention program elements.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe Mermentau Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has a co"

The review program also identifies the steps used or needed to detect or monitor such releases.  \n\nThe Mermentau Facility uses hazard review techniques developed by persons knowledgeable about the process and equipment, to determine whether the process is designed, fabricated and operated in accordance with applicable standards or rules.  The reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The review team findings are documented and forwarded to local management and corporate engineering for resolution.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard review results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The facility also conducts reviews whenever a major change in the process occurs.  The findings of the review are resolved before startup of the changed process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.

Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures the Mermentau Facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at acceptable levels.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nAnother integral part of maintenance program is quality assurance.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition the Mermentau Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Mermentau Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
