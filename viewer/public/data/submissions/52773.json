      "SummaryText": "Sargento Foods, Inc. in Kiel, Wisconsin is a dairy processing plant with modern capabilities. The facility was constructed in 1993; building additions were completed in 2004 and 2008. The facility occupies about 250,000 square feet, and is situated on a 40-acre parcel of land. The property is located in a predominantly rural area, on the northern outskirts of the City of Kiel. Adjacent properties to the northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast are farmland or undeveloped land. Commercial-type properties are located to the south, southwest, and west. Residential properties are located to the southwest beyond the commercial properties. A few residences are located to the north.\n\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well being of their employees, the environment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees, annual emergency response training for the response teams and ammonia system training for the maintenance personnel. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits are required. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code COMM Chapter 43 and ASTM standards. The system is a basic two-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The total maximum intended inventory of ammonia within the refrigeration system at any time is approximately 32,000 pounds. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento maintenance employees make daily inspections 365 days per year.\n\nSargento Foods has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage or sheltering in place. If an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response"

Emergency drills are carried out several times each year. The Manitowoc County Local Emergency Planning Committee has developed an offsite plan for the ammonia system and is aware of the procedures in case of a release or emergency situation. The local response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis. Qualified trainers are retained from Lakeshore Technical College to conduct annual 8-hour HAZWOPER refresher training. The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been trained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response personnel. Training and maintenance schedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods\u00bfKiel facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Kiel facility. The PSM is audited every three years. The most recent audit was June 4 and 5, 2008. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The last PHA was conducted in April 2008, as part of the building expansion project. The PHA showed a great improvement in safety measures had been achieved as a result of addressing the concerns of previous PHA\u00bfs."
