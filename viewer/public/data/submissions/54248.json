      "SummaryText": "The Schroeder Milk Company, located at 2080 Rice Street, Maplewood, MN, is a production facility offering a wide range of dairy products. Schroeder Milk uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The Schroeder Milk refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 5? vac to a high side of 185 psi. Due to the ammonia system expansion done in 2003 the systems maximum intended inventory is 21,785 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nThe Schroeder Milk worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is 17,250 pounds. The normal operating level in the HPR is 8,625 pounds, so the worst-case release scenario takes in account the possibility the vessel would be 80% full holding 13,800 pounds. In calculating the area affected by this failure, the engine room enclosure, where the HPR is located, will provide passive mitigation, there by reducing the toxic endpoint of the release. The engine room has a continuous air ventilation of 2,640 cfm and an emergency ventilation of 26,400 cfm. This allows for minimum of 12 air changes per hour in the engine room. Using the RMP Comp program downloaded from the EPA Home Page the calculated toxic endpoint was 1.0 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 9,100, with two schools, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses and some recreational areas. There are no hospitals located within the area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nThe alternative toxic release scenario was also determined by using the EPA's RMP Guidance. The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided a pressure relief valve rel"

The estimated population within the distance would be 350 people. There is also one school, some residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. There are no hospitals in the area.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency response Policies:\nThe Schroeder Milk Company has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release. Schroeder Milk Company has also coordinated efforts with the Maplewood Volunteer Fire Department to establish a joint response program. The Schroeder Milk established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nSchroeder Milk Company has trained personnel that are the refrigeration operators to assure they can perform their responsibilities and procedures safely. The refrigeration operators receive training on the ammonia system when there is a change in the system and at minimum of every three years. Schroeder Milk has also trained personnel in the Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response Program, OSHA 29 CFR 1910. 120 HAZWAOPER. The trained personnel have been trained at the level of the Technician Level Responder and also the Incident Commander on scene. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or a flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Schroeder Milk has established a written operating procedure for the ammonia system and has included in the procedure the Emergency "
