      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Plan for the Commerce Water Treatment Plant minimizes the likelihood and potential effects of a chemical accident involving chlorine by identifying and reducing potential hazards as well as preparing employees and responders to handle a chemical emergency.  This is accomplished by establishing a program in accordance with the EPA's requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part 68  providing for employee and public safety.\n\nThe importance dedicated to the safe operation of the Commerce plant is reflected in it's record of no reportable releases or accidents involving chlorine over the past 5 years.  The continued safety to the plants employees and the surrounding community will be further ensured through the implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Commerce Water Treatment Plant, located on Water Plant Road north of Commerce, Georgia,  uses chlorine to disinfect raw water as part of the treatment process necessary to provide clean drinking water for the Commerce area.  The plant stores as much as 6,450 lbs. of liquified chlorine under pressure in containers holding 2,000 lbs. and cylinders of 150 lbs.  The chlorination process involves a system where chlorine gas is piped from these containers and then controlled and metered until being applied as a solution to the raw water.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was conducted, using software provided by the EPA for this purpose called RMP*Comp, to assess the potential off-site area at risk given an accidental release of chlorine from the plant were to occur.  A worst-case scenario was first considered involving an unlikely event in which the entire contents of a single container, 2,000 lbs., escaped over a ten minute period.  An alternate-case scenario was then conducted to assess a potential accident thought to be more likely to occur than the worst-case.  This situation assumed chlorine was released at a rate of 10.5 lbs./sec. for 60 minutes consistent with what would be expected from a leak invol"

In each case, the modeling was performed to determine the distance a chlorine cloud could possibly reach before dissipating to an acceptable level, called the toxic endpoint, at which it is believed that an individual can be exposed for up to an hour without experiencing significant effects.\n\nThe worst-case scenario resulted in an endpoint distance of 3.0 miles and the alternate case was estimated to reach no more than 0.2 miles. \n\nFor each of these scenarios it is important to point out that the modeling results are intended to serve as a simplistic guide in establishing the entire area surrounding the plant that could be at risk in the event of a chlorine release. The actual behavior of a chlorine cloud will depend to a large degree on the local topography since chlorine gas is 2.5 times as heavy as air.  The toxic cloud will be more likely to flow down hill than to have it's path determined by prevailing winds. Furthermore, no mitigation measures such as enclosures and the abundance of trees in the area, which would each hinder the advance of a toxic cloud, were considered when inputting information into the models.\n\nTo lessen the likelihood and mitigate the effects of a potential release of chlorine, the Commerce River WTP's Risk Management Program provides a means for ensuring that the plant operators' preparedness is improved in the following important areas:\n\n1.  Chlorine hazard and safety\n2.  Operating procedures for safely operating the chlorine system\n3.  Operator training on operating procedures and emergency response\n4.  Preventive maintenance\n5.  Emergency action and emergency response\n\nTo ensure that an emergency situation is handled effectively, this RMP includes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The EAP details appropriate procedures for the plant operators to follow in responding to a chlorine accident including stopping a leak and contacting emergency personnel.  The ERP, "

The ERP includes a prediction of the most likely path a toxic cloud may take based on the local topography.  \n\nEffective emergency action and response is ensured through initial and ongoing training of emergency response procedures.  Plant operators are trained on chlorine hazards, stopping chlorine leaks, and emergency procedures and equipment.  \n\nThis Risk Management Program is designed so that each element may be easily implemented and maintained ensuring that potential hazards are closely monitored, operators stay sufficiently trained, and an emergency situation will be handled as efficiently as possible.  This will assure that the Commerce Water Treatment Plant will continue the safe operation of its chlorination process in  providing high quality drinking water for the surrounding region."
