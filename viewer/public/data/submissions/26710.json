All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are\r\naddressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and\r\nresponse agency interaction.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Creek WPCP utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before it is\r\nreturned to the Ocmulgee River.  In addition, the Rocky Creek WPCP also uses Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia to assist in treating wastewater.  Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine\r\ncylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, and process\r\nsafety equipment.  Ammonia processes include liquid Anhydrous Ammonia above ground\r\ntanks, an instrumentation room, electrical equipment, and process safety equipment.\r\n\r\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance\r\ntraveled by chlorine and ammonia released before its concentration decrease to a\r\ntheoretical toxic endpoint.  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene\r\nAssociation as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly\r\nall individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-\r\nthreatening health effects.  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to\r\nthe toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for the Rocky Creek WPCP involves a failure of a 13,000\r\ngallon storage vessel yielding a cumulative release of 10,000 gallons (52,000 lbs) of\r\nammonia.  The Rocky Creek facility has two (2) storage vessels for ammonia.  The\r\nmaximum inventory for ammonia at any given time is 52,000 lbs.  When a"
