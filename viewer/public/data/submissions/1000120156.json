Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe at Sysco South Florida, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Miami Dade Fire & Rescue, which provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on Process/operational requirements, is 29,520 pounds, for the purposes of the RMP submission the chemical quantity was rounded to 30,000 based on RMP General Guidance.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention\nSteps:\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia\n(Anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is\nalso subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nOur facility keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation on the ammonia process at the Sysco South Florida, Inc. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contr"

A copy of the PSI is available for review to all employees who work on or near the ammonia process equipment.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nSysco South Florida, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\nSysco South Florida, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nSysco South Florida, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls an"
