KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is one of several facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the facility, anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) are produced and loaded on truck and railcar for distribution. \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane and hydrogen is found i"

      "SummaryText": "n the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nHydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonium polyphosphate and urea ammonium nitrate are stored at the facility.  These substances are not subject to RMP reporting for reasons discussed below.  Hydrochloric acid is stored at the facility; however, it is stored in amounts well below threshold quantity (2 liters).  According to 40 CFR 68.130 Table 1, the 53% nitric acid stored at the facility is in a concentration lower than the minimum necessary to be considered an RMP substance (80%).  Sulfuric acid is stored at the facility; however, it is not a listed RMP substance.  Urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium polyphosphate are mixtures that do not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making these products exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00b7Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small release associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00b7Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety"

Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of interrupting the combustion of ammonia vapors in the flare by having a continuous pilot in the flare.  \n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup UPS in place.\n\u00b7Providing a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\n\u00b7Installing chlorine detectors at the chlorine use area to help ensure that a chlorine release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\u00b7Installing low-pressure trip switches on ammonia loading hoses to stop product transfer in the event of a hose rupture.\n\u00b7Requiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and supply emergency air equipment in the control rooms.\n\u00b7Manning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all loading operations.\n\u00b7Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00b7Equipping the rail loading scale with an automatic shutdown, which will prohibit further product movement upon reaching the weight of a full railcar.  \n\u00b7Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\n\u00b7Level indications are in place on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n\u00b7Providing a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant has had one incident occur during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.  This incident occurred on Septemb"

The ammonia surge tank relief valve relieved to a catch tank.  This catch tank then released ammonia vapor to the atmosphere.  One employee inhaled ammonia vapors and was taken to the hospital for a breathing treatment.  He returned to work the next day.  As a result of this incident, the facility relocated the relief valve catch tank to help prevent a recurrence of the accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant with the Gage County LEPC, which includes the Beatrice Rural Fire Department and the Gage County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Beatrice Hazardous Materials Team, Beatrice Community Hospital, the Nebraska State Patrol, Norris Public Power and Kinder Morgan (natural gas supplier).  The Beatrice Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00b7The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00b7The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazard"

The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
