The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances. In the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n2.0 Description of the City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant is located in Sherman, Texas. The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. These substances are:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and 150 pound cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n* Aqueous Ammonia - bulk quantity stored in an above ground tank and used for stabilization of chlorine residual in treated water.\n\n\n\n3.01 Hazard Assessment\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility. This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release sce"

The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant disinfection and storage processes. The following details the prevention program elements at The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1 Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant processes. Material safety data sheets (MSDS/SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant. The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n4.2 Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards. Checklists are used to guide the hazard review. These checklists include items to help ensure The City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe City of Sherman Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be perfor"
