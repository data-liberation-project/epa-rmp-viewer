This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this RMPlan. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\nThe Santa Ynez Unit - Las Flores Canyon Treating Plant, located about 17 miles west of Santa Barbara, California, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This facility could contain a regulated flammable mixture and a regulated toxic. Transportation of regulated substances into and out of the facility is handled via pipeline and truck.  Refer to the RMP Plan for more specific information concerning regulated inventories.\n\nThis facility is located in a vegetated canyon with undeveloped, rural land extending beyond the canyon to the north, east and west.  A highway borders the canyon approximately 1.5 miles to the south.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) \nSpecifics concerning the Offsite Consequence Analyses are contained in the RMPlan Data Element Sections 4 and 5.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following "

Processes at this facility regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to (and in compliance with) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The OIMS contact at this facility is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, levels) in the operating procedu"

This facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThis facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a knowledge-based PHA Revalidation incorporating a What/If Checklist, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering personnel, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on a relative risk.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained"

The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThis facility maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for specific equipment or process parameters.  Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written operating procedures, this facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintain"

This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented for each employee.\n\nContractors\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, this facility has procedures in place to help ensure contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to their working in this facility which includes: (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) applicable emergency action plan provisions, and (4) information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\n\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs/performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and this facility supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThis facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a significant change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSS"

The basic aspects of this MI program include: (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) inspections/tests, (4) correction of identified deficiencies, and (5) quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on: (1) the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency procedures, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures and equipment manuals help ensure work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  \n\nInspections/tests and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to help ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness, etc.).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a group of experts (e.g., engineers, etc.) review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the equipment until the deficiency can be corrected.\n\nAnother integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.  This facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to help ensure new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials/spare parts are used for repairs.\n\nHot Work and Other Safe Work Practices\nThis facility has long-standing safe"

These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nThis facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes.  This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training related to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThis facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards thes"
