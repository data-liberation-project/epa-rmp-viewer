This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. This update is being submitted because of major modifications to two processes.  This RMP is for FHR West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. \r\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing. For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR West refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining.'\r\nFHR's emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, in-plant industrial emergency response group (Refinery Terminal Fire Company - RTFC). In addition, over fifty trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary due to the Corpus Christi Port Industrial consortium.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. For process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFHR's policy is to encourage employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention programs. Examples of employee participation included updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention. These processes include teams such as the Central Environmental Health and Safety Council (CEHSC), Hazard Recognition Team (HRT), and the Refinery Process Safety Committee (RPSC).

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  In addition, the team may request further review of some scenarios through the use of Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in order to further evaluate the controls in place.\r\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel. Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is intended to help ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. PHA action items are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System, LYNX. Within this system, an employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date. Responsible employees are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date. For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR's practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. The results and findings from base and revalidation PHAs are documented and retained. \r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFHR's policy is to maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is available on the FHR Intranet and in the control room area.\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR's policy is to implement a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is paired with a senior operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

The purpose of these activities is to form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. The governing documents that address FHR's mechanical integrity program include the following Equipment Synopsis documents for: \r\n- Fixed Equipment\r\n- Electrical Equipment\r\n- Instrumented Systems\r\n- Machinery\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written toolbox and vendor procedures are used to help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team reviews the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. FHR's practice is to incorporate quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This is intended to help ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\nSafe"
