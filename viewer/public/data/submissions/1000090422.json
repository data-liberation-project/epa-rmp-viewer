The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel or Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to AmeriGas retail facilities and wholesale customers.  Propane is received by rail cars then distributed to the customers by truck transports. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\r\n\r\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prev"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \r\n\r\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems and emergency response equipment are also installed on site.  Shutdown systems include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate a problem once detected.  \r\n\r\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHAA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPAA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58, 2001 and 2004 editions.  \r\n\r\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas AssociationA\u00bfs (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility is considered a non-responding site and as such it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which includes procedures for notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.

Should an actual incident occur, the EAP gives guidance to employees on how to respond to minor accidents, incidental spills and/or small fires.  Portable fire extinguishers are maintained throughout the site and hand-held warning horns are used to generate an audible warning to personnel on site when warranted.  Larger emergencies require assistance from local emergency response organizations and on-site personnel are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\r\n\r\nThe plan is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and as stated above, employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.  This site's EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\r\n\r\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\r\n2) OSHAA\u00bfs Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, A\u00bfEmergency Action PlansA\u00bf, 29CFR 1910.39, A\u00bfFire Prevention PlansA\u00bf, 29 CFR 1910.119, A\u00bfProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous ChemicalsA\u00bf and 29 CFR 1910.120, A\u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency ResponseA\u00bf\r\n3) National Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58, A\u00bfLiquified Petroleum Gas CodeA\u00bf and NFPA 54, A\u00bfNational Fuel Gas CodeA\u00bf.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNo physical changes are planned at the site for the immediate future.
