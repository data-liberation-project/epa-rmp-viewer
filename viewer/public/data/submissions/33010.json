The Hershall B. Norred Water Treatment Plant meets the established criteria that require Program compliance through on-site storage and use of chlorine, in excess of threshold limits.  At the WTP, chlorine is used to disinfect drinking water, which is withdrawn from local reservoirs, treated, and distributed to consumers.\n\nNewnan Utilities is committed to providing essential municipal water treatment services while avoiding accidents that place human and environmental health at risk.  These goals are met through a comprehensive Accident Prevention Program and a coordinated Emergency Response Plan.  Specific elements of the Accident Prevention Program for chlorine storage, handling, and use include:\n\n-On-site provision of safety information as required by State law, ASTM standards, and ASME standards \n-Identification of hazards associated with the storage, handling, and use of listed chemicals\n-Periodic review of equipment operating procedures, supplemented with written guidelines\n-Implementation of on-the-job training and observational competency testing programs\n-Periodic review of equipment maintenance procedures, supplemented with written guidelines\n-Performance of program compliance audits \n-Performance of incident investigations\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan also meets the stated goals in the event of a chemical release through the following elements:\n\n-On-site provision of a written emergency response plan, including step-by-step emergency actions\n-Established procedures for public notification\n-Coordination with loc"
