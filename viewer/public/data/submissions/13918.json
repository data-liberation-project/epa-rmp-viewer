The storage area consists of a fenced-in area wih a roof. The chlorine containers lie on a concrete slab within the storage area. There are chlorine danger signs on the enclosed fence. Only one chlorine gas container is in operation at any time with another on stand-by. The chlorine gas flows through\na Regal switchover chlorine regulator and is piped to an enclosed Chlorine room. Within the Chlorine room, it is metered through rotameters and piped to the two treatment plants.\n\nB. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe chlorine gas flows through a vacuum system that shuts off the gas if there is any condition that breaks off the vacuum such as a gas leak.  A chlorine sensor and alarm system is located where the two one-ton containers are situated. This system will alert the operator on duty of a chlorine release. When an empty one ton container is being taken out of operation, there are two water plant operator personnel present, the individual performing the task and other as a emergency response individual.\n\nC.THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst Case Scenerio sheet states the chlorine release quantity,release rate, release duration,wind\nspeed, distance to end point , residential population and public receptor impact. If such a release were to\noccur then outside emergency responders would be called in such as: a. State Police/DEQ Hotline, b. National Response Center, c. Lafourche Parish Emergency Response Center, d. Thibodaux Police and Fire\nDepartments, and the Local DEQ office. All water plant operators would be called in to work.  The in-plant \ntrained emergency response team would be in their SCBA and PPE units and would use the Chlorine Emergency Kit B to identify and stop the chlorine leak on the appropriate leaking one-ton container. The other operators"

      "SummaryText": "will assist the outside emergency responders in aswering phones, keeping people away from the release area and giving aid to the responders or any person affected by the gas release. All affected personnel will be transported by emergency vehicles to the emergency room of the Thibodaux General Hospital.\n\nD. THE ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Alternate Case Scenario sheet states the chlorine release quanitity, release rate, release duration, wind speed, distance to end point,residential population and public receptor impact. If such a release were to occur the chlorine gas would be shut off at the source by closing the chlorine gas valve that is on the \none-ton container. This action would be performed by the operator on duty or by the Plant Manager or Plant Supervisor. Emergency respoders would be notified first and then asked to come out if the release was not manageable or the possibility of affecting the public.\n\nE. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of the following items: a. Keep all equipment dealing with the chlorine system in good working condition, b. Train the water plant operators in prevention and emergency response, c. Respond quickly to the near accident occurences and determine the causes and correction actions needed, d. Run Hazard reviews and Compliance Audits at least on a yearly basis.\n\nF. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Thibodaux Water Plant does not have a major five year accident history.\n\nG. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (ERP)\n\nThe ERP consists of the following: 1. Shut off the chlorine gas at the source, if possible, 2. Call the Plant Manager and Plant Supervisor, 3. Call the in-plant and (dependant on the severity of the release) outside emergency response teams, 4. The in-plant emergency response team wearing the proper personal protection equipment with SCBAs would identify the type of leak and stop it using the Chlorine Emergency\nKit B on the one- ton container, 5. Other water plant ope"

Continue training of all water plant personnel in chlorine knowledge,safety, release prevention and emergency response, 2. Further investigate means of limiting the distance that the chlorine gas will travel,\nand 3. Investigate less toxic alternative disinfection systems ."
