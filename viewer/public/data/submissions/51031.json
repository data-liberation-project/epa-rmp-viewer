Facility Policy:  The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient. \n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:  This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency.  Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.  \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.
