If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Grundy County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.\tFacility Information.\n\n\t The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as a nutriant for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 320,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario:  a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.60 mile. \n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\tThe facility is in compliance with the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and  Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200).
