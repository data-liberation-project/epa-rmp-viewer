BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors. These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolicies\r\n\r\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\r\n\r\nWe produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\r\nWe assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\r\nWe minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\r\nEconomic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\r\nAn important contribution to Sustainable Development is our involvement in the Responsible Care initiative worldwide.

Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\r\n\r\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Amnicola Highway Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Amnicola Highway Site uses 1,3 Butadiene and Anhydrous Ammonia. Ammonia is used for cooling purposes only. 1,3 Butadiene is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used in a variety of products including foams for pillows and mattresses, shoe inserts, general purpose adhesives and for asphalt modification to improve resiliency and extend the service life of streets and highways. \r\n\r\n2-(cis)Butene and 2-Trans) Butene are contaminates in the 1,3 Butadiene and are recovered and sent off site for recycling.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility experienced one accidental release(s) over the past five years, which meets the reporting criteria for internal property damage >$25K. The incident, occurring on 2/14/12 @ 0430 hours, was the result of a shaft coupling failure on an ammonia compressor. At the time of the failure, plant safeguards, including a water curtain & fixed fire water monitors were activated by plant personnel for vapor suppression/dispersion, local emergency responders (Chattanooga Fire Dept) were notified & responded. Together with trained BASF emergency responders, the incident was managed & successfully re"

Facility HazMat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly. The BASF Chattanooga site is also the home of the Southeast Technical Resource and Chemical Emergency Response (TRACER)team which consists of Specialist Level Responders capable of responding to transportation incidents involving hazardous materials. These Specialist Responders have assisted local fire and emergency officials in managing non-BASF emergencies when called upon as well.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChanges to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, some changes already made that have improved the safety of our regulated processes include:\r\n\r\nInstallation of ammonia specific toxic sensors in all areas of the plant using ammonia. \r\nA vapor suppression system in the ammonia refrigeration unit has been constructed by totally surrounding the unit with an emergency deluge system providing a curtain of water for vapor knock down. \r\nA fixed deluge system has been installed directly over the ammonia pre-coolers in the finishing area for vapor suppression and knockdown.  \r\nA fixed & dedicated emergency shortstop addition system has been added to the reactor area providing the capability of interupting any runaway polymerization event in any reactor. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes already completed, the site is investigating the replacement of anhydrous ammonia with a safer alternate refrigerant."
