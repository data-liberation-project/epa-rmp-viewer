This has improved Yosemite Cold Storage #2's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Yosemite Cold Storage #2's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nYosemite Cold Storage #2 has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Yosemite Cold Storage #2 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Yosemite Cold Storage #2 now"

The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nThere is an ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room, each precool room, and each storage room. Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Yosemite Cold Storage #2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
