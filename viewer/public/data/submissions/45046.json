INTRODUCTION\n\nThe United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP).  The RMP is in accordance with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The PGDP plant is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP requirements.\n\n2.   MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n\nUSEC is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of the workers and the public, and protects the environment.  In order to meet these commitments, USEC has issued an operations policy manual which states, in part:  USEC is ultimately responsible for, and is committed to, safe operations, maintenance, design, fabrication, and testing of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of workers and the public, protects the environment, and provides for the common defense and security.\n\nProgram and staff organizations are established for safety, safeguards and quality, and environmental, safety, and health with sufficient resources to support the line organization in safe operation of the plant.\n\n3.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n3.1  Facility Description and Location\n\nPGDP enriches uranium using the gaseous diffusion process.  The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is located at 37\u00b06'49? N. latitude and 88\u00b047'39? W. longitude measured at the center of the plant, on a 3423-acre tract in McCracken County, Kentucky. The site is generally in a rural area and was previously part of the Kentucky Ordnance Works.  PGDP occupies approximately 650 acres within the Controlled Access Area. Highway U.S. 60 is the closest major highway and intersects the plant access road 3 miles south of the plant. Interstate Highway 24 is to the east"

      "SummaryText": "ll leaks from manifolds and manifold connections.\n\nOn June 16, 2003 there was a release of approximately 50 pounds from the C-410-K fluorine manifold facility.  There were no offsite consequences.  The plant is in the process of modifying the C-410-K fluorine manifold facility to accept multi-tube trailers, containing a mixture of fluorine and nitrogen.  Once the switch is made, the manifold system will no longer be used.\n\n5.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nChemical safety at PGDP consists of the integration of environmental, safety, and health management systems to address chemical safety.  Chemical safety controls are designed to mitigate the adverse affects of the toxic materials used in the enrichment process to workers, the public, and the environment.  To achieve this objective, safety analyses, process hazard analyses, and industrial hygiene and safety programs are utilized.\n\n5.1  Systems\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with container-mounted vacuum regulators which reduce the pressure of the chlorine from the vapor pressure of the liquid chlorine in the container to a partial vacuum.  Loss of vacuum for any reason causes the vacuum-regulating valve to close the gas supply, minimizing the release in the event of a break in the manifold.\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with chlorine detectors which provide alarms to plant personnel in the event of a release.\n\nManually operated, remote valve closing rods are administratively required to be in place on the stem of open 1-ton chlorine container valves.  These valves can be operated from outside of the chlorinator rooms in the event of a release from the manifold system.\n\n5.2  Procedures\n\nPlant procedures are prepared in accordance with the requirements of a formal procedure system.  The procedure program includes the development, review and approval, revision process, distribution, and procedure configuration management.  Specific procedures for the operation and maintenance of chlo"

      "SummaryText": "s.  RCW is treated with chlorine, via chlorinators in four RCW pump houses, to control the growth of microorganisms in the RCW system.  Two pump houses have two 1-ton containers with one container connected to the manifold system, and two pump houses have four 1-ton containers of which two are connected to the manifold system at any time.\n\nChlorine is also stored in 1-ton containers at C-745- A storage yard.\n\n3.3.2  Fluorine\n\nFluorine is used as a fluorinating agent for conditioning new equipment surfaces prior to UF6 exposure and may be used to dry equipment after exposure to wet air.  The fluorine system primarily consists of C-410-K, C-410-D, and the distribution piping, valves, and instrumentation.  Fluorine is purchased as a 20% fluorine/80% nitrogen molar mixture and it is delivered in DOT-approved multi-tube trailers.  A full DOT-approved trailer nominally contains 1800 lbs of fluorine at 2000 psig that is distributed in eight separate tubes (i.e., nominally 225 lbs of fluorine per tube).  One nominally full and one nominally empty (i.e., heeled) multi-tube trailer may be stored in both the C-745-A and C-745-B storage yards.  When needed, a full multi-tube trailer is moved to the C-410-K Fluorine Facility, where the gas pressure is reduced to defined levels and is then fed to the storage tanks or the pressure reducing manifolds in the C-410-D Fluorine Storage Building.  The pressure of the gas mixture is further reduced at the C-410-D pressure reducing manifolds then fed to the fluorine distribution header for distribution to other plant locations.  The amount of fluorine stored in C-745-A/C-745-B storage yards and the C 410 D/C-410-K complex exceeds the threshold quantity for fluorine defined in 29 CFR 1910.119, Appendix A.  \n\n4.
