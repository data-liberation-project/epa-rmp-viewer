      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary  \r\n\r\nThe West Travis County Public Utility Agency owns the West Travis County PUA Surface Water Treatment Plant, 12215 Bee Cave Road, Austin, Texas 78738.  The West Travis County PUA Board of Directors is designated the RMP Liaison.  The RMP Liaison has delegated responsibility for overseeing implementation of the Risk Management Program to the Contract Operator-Severn Trent Services.  The mission of the facility is to protect public health by treating and distributing water, while ensuring a safe operation for our employees, visitors and community.  Operation of the facility includes the addition of chemicals that, if released in an uncontrolled manner, may present a risk to public health and the environment.  To address this risk, Severn Trent Services has developed a Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68 and a Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The overall goal of these programs is to reduce the risk to employees, the public, and the environment by focusing on preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The chemicals that are currently regulated and addressed in this RMP are as follows:\r\n\r\nChemical(s)\t\tMaximum Inventory\r\nChlorine\t\t20,000 pounds\r\n\r\nThe RMP and PSMP regulations are similar in nature in that most of the requirements are identical.  While most requirements are identical, the RMP regulation has a few additional requirements than the PSMP.  Therefore, this plan was written in conformance with the RMP regulation and is inherently in conformance with the PSMP regulation.  Please see Section 1.4 for a more detailed comparison of the RMP and PSMP requirements.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\nThe West Travis County PUA Surface Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidental releases of a regulated substance that caused on-site or off-site injuries, deaths, property damage or environmental damage within the past five years."

      "SummaryText": "Any future release incidents shall be documented and incorporated into the Risk Management Program within six months of any reportable occurrence.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nSafety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, training programs and maintenance programs shall be reviewed on a yearly basis to provide a continuous prevention program.  Elements of the prevention program shall be reviewed and updated after any significant change to the equipment or process at the West Travis County PUA Surface Water Treatment Plant.  Any significant change to the prevention program elements requires an update of the Risk Management Plan information presented to the EPA.  A compliance audit must be performed at least once every three years, with documentation records maintained for at least five years.  \r\n\r\nAn incident investigation must be performed following a release incident as described in CHAPTER 8 of this program.  Accidental releases shall prompt a review and update of the prevention program elements.\r\nThe prevention program shall be an on-going process that is reviewed and updated to meet the on-going and changing needs of the West Travis County PUA Water Treatment Plant. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nThe emergency response number for this facility is: 911.  The local Fire Department is prepared to respond to an emergency chemical release at the West Travis County PUA Surface Water Treatment Plant."
