If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Roanoke Fire Department and the Huntington County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Huntington County EMS.  The primary hospital response is provided through Parkview Huntington Hospital.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.  \r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Development & Logistics, LLC Huntington Terminal is a propane storage and distribution terminal.  The terminal receives propane and a propane/unleaded gasoline interface from the Buckeye Pipeline System.  Propane product is stored in an underground cavern, and interface product is stored in three designated 30,000-gallon interface storage vessels.  Interface product is unloaded to tanker trucks for reprocessing off-site.  Prior to tank truck loading, propane is sent through a dryer system to remove moisture and meet quality specifications.  At the truck rack, product is measured and ethyl mercaptan odorant is added automatically.  The terminal is equipped with multiple security systems and the system is designed to fail safe.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility's worst case scenario is the complete failure of one single largest storage vessel filled to 85% capacity (assumes 100% propane for compliance purposes) resulting in a total"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site and includes both public and limited environmental receptors.  The Facility's alternate (potential to impact off-site populations) scenario is a BLEVE involving an interface storage vessel.  The resulting distance to endpoint extends off-site and affects both public receptors and limited environmental receptors.  \r\n\r\nThe Buckeye Development & Logistics, LLC - Huntington Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D - Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).  \r\n\r\nThis is a RMP for an existing propane process (acquired from BP, October 2011): there have been no accidents/incidents resulting in a significant release within the previous five (5) years of operations as reported by the Huntington Terminal personnel and a review of incident records.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Huntington Terminal propane storage and distribution system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Roanoke Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Roanoke Fire Department and the Huntington County LEPC.  The Roanoke Fire Department is aware of the Facility's propane system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the even of a significant release.  The Huntington Terminal maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth with 10 feet of the interface vessels.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.  \r\n\r\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process fo"
