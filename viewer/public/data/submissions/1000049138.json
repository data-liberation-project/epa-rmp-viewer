The Illinois Street Water Treatment Plant is located in the City of Bedford, Indiana.  Chlorine is the only RMP regulated substance at the facility and it is used for disinfection of drinking water.\r\nThe Bedford Illinois Street Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program consists of all the required prevention Program 3 elements.  The prevention program for the plant consists of several sections, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program includes the response program for incident leaks as handled by plant employees and the program for major spills and/or releases as covered in the Lawrence County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plans for Hazardous Materials Incidents.  Proper handling equipment is maintained at the plant for use in the incidental release situations. Major releases or problems encountered with the smaller releases will be handled by outside assistance. The plant will contact the Lawrence County Emergency Management Director for assistance with chemical releases. Crane and Bloomington Township Fire Department Hazmat team will then be contacted by Emergency Management. In the past five years, the Bedford Illinois Street Water Treatment Plant has not had an accidental chlorine release.  The facility is included under the community emergency response plan through the local LEPC appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders."
