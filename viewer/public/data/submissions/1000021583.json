EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RPM) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to meet the requirements of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified in the Code of Federal Regulation Title 40 Part 68.\n\nStationary source and chemical of concern\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods is located on Kodiak Island in the city of Kodiak, Alaska. The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the spring and summer months. The plant produces fresh and frozen processed seafood products.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  The estimate calculated inventory of ammonia for the entire plant system is 26,900 pounds. This is a combination of the ammonia charge in Machine Rooms 1, 2, and 3. Machine Rooms 1 & 3 are both within the same building structure. In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release. The plant has been operating safely since 1962.\n\nWorst-case Scenario\nA worst-case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Failure of the largest vessel in the system, the High Pressure Receiver (HPR), when filled to capacity would release 7,155 pounds of ammonia.  The HPR is located in the machinery room.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the HPR fails catastrophically, releasing its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  To obtain the most conservative assumption, it is assumed that the building does not mitigate the rate of release, but the ammonia exits to the outdoors via doors and ventilation shafts in the machinery room roof. The release is modeled using RMP CompTM  software.  Modeling results show the distance to the toxic "

The 2000 census data indicates the residential population within the radius of release to be 1,837.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard identified during the Process Hazard Analysis conducted during documentation of the facility prevention plan.  In this scenario, a pipe to a plate freezer in the cold storage complex breaks resulting in a liquid ammonia release to atmosphere.  The release occurs indoors.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in Chapter 4 of the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (EPA GAR) and calculated by RMP CompTM software.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safely information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safely, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system itself has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves.  Plant personnel responsible for the system have had extensive training in ammonia systems and hazardous material handling and response. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirement of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property"

There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM plan to facilitate response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. The facility has coordinated its emergency response plan with local authorities and responders and conducts drills periodically to practice responses.\n"
