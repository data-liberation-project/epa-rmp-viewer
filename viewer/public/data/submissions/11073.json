If an emergency were to occur, the Unilever Warehouse 107 would coordinate with the Chicago Fire Department and other agencies in Cook County should they be requested to respond to an emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled. This facility warehouses consumer aerosol products containing a mixture of the following regulated substances under 112(r) stored above the threshold quantity: \n\n* Propane \n* Butane \n* Isobutane \n* Methyl Ether \n* Difluoroethane \n\nThe worst-case release scenario. The worst-case scenario is failure of one 14-ounce aerosol container (this contains 0.30 pounds of propellant). The worst-case scenario would affect a radius of 0.005 miles, which does not affect any off-site receptors.  Due to limitations of RMP*Submit, the input parameters were 1 pound and 0.01 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\nFive-year accident history. No accidents involving the aerosol products stored at this facility have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings-in-place at this facility.\n\nThe emergency response program. If an emergency were to occur, the Warehouse 107 facility would coordinate with the Chicago Fire Department.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.

The intent of Section 112(r) is to prevent accidental releases to the air and mitigate the consequences of such releases by focusing prevention measures on chemicals that pose the greatest risk to the public and the environment.\n\nSection 112(r)(7) of the CAA Amendments mandates that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgate regulations and develop guidance to prevent, detect, and respond to accidental releases.  In response, the Final Rule and Notice for the Risk Management Program was issued on June 20, 1996 and is found at Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). Stationary sources with processes that contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance are covered by these regulations and must develop a Risk Management Program.  The program must be described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP), which, in turn, must be registered with the EPA, submitted to state and local authorities, and made available to the public. \n\nAn owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, must comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Requirements found at 40 CFR 68 by no later than the latest of the following dates:\n\n7 June 21, 1999;\n7 Three years after the date on which a regulated substance is first listed under 40 CFR 68.130; or\n7 The date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process.\n\nUnilever Chicago Consolidated Distribution Center (Unilever) stores aerosol products in their Chicago, Illinois ware"

After completing the previous chapters of this notebook, most of the information required to complete the RMP has already been gathered.\n\n4.1. Executive Summary\n\nThe eight subject headings per 40 CFR 68.155 are contained in the executive summary for the Unilever Chicago Consolidated Distribution Center. A sample of the executive summary is contained in the RMP*Submit file for the facility.  To edit the executive summary, install RMP*Submit from the CEPPO webpage.  The datafiles for RMP*Submit are SRMPDATA.LDB and SRMPDATA.MDB on the facility data diskette.
