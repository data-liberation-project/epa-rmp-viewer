      "SummaryText": "The Pilkington North America Rossford Float Plant, located in Rossford, Ohio, is subject to the 40 CFR 68 \"Risk Management Program\" due to onsite storage of 3,000 pounds (lbs) of titanium tetrachloride, above the titanium tetrachloride threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs.  The facility manufactures auto glass primarily and some building glass using the float glass process.  The facility is not subject to OSHA PSM (titanium tetrachloride is not listed), it's NAICS code is 327211 (Flat Glass Manufacturing), and the distance to the applicable endpoint associated with the worst case scenario reaches off-site receptors; therefore, the facility is subject to EPA RMP Program Level 2.\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan (April, 2006) and has a good safety record associated with titanium tetrachloride.  The titanium tetrachloride storage is in it's own building separate from the main plant building, and inside it's storage building there is a plexiglass enclosure around the two storage tanks which is maintained at a negative pressure and exhausted to a 211 foot high exhaust stack.  There is monitoring for hydrogen chloride (common and readily produced byproduct of titanium tetrachloride upon release), oxygen, and carbon monoxide on the enclosure exhaust.  In addition, there is a floor catch basin (sump) which can contain the entire content of the two storage tanks and provision for covering any released titanium tetrachloride with mineral oil to minimize the potential release to air.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario was determined to be a loss of containment of a truck delivery of titanium tetrachloride outside of the storage building, a 1,500 lb release.  This would create a pool of titanium tetrachloride of approximately 23 feet diameter, emitting 4.5 pounds per minute of titanium tetrachloride to air for a duration of 5.5 hours.  At worst case conditions, this release would impact to a distance of 0.6 miles.  This impact distance reaches off-site receptors."

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 47516,
      "SummaryText": "Regarding the Worst Case Release Scenario, please note that titanium tetrachloride reacts rapidly with moisture in the air to form hydrochloric acid and other titanium compounds, such as titanium hydroxide and titanium oxychlorides.  An analysis of the predicted hydrochloric acid emission rate to the air from a 4.5 pounds per minute titanium tetrachloride release rate, equal to (4.5 lbs/hr TiCl4)(1 mole TiCl4/189.71 lbs TiCl4)(4 moles HCl/1 mole TiCl4)(36.45 lbs HCl/1 mole HCl) = 3.5 pounds per minute HCl, indicates an impact distance of 0.4 miles.  Such an impact distance reaches off-site receptors, but to a lesser degree than the TiCl4-modeled Worst Case Release Scenario.\n\nTruck delivery of titanium tetrachloride occurs fairly infrequently, approximately four or five times per year.  It is a specifically scheduled event during the day shift.  Truck delivery of titanium tetrachloride is recognized as a critical operation.  Training of facility personnel is conducted so that it is done with the proper attention and care.   \n\nIn the event of a worst case release of titanium tetrachloride, facility personnel will attempt to limit the pool size as conditions allow.  This will tend to reduce the actual release rate and subsequently increase the release duration, assuming it is not possible to recover any of the released titanium tetrachloride.  Although the release duration would increase, the impact distance would decrease because the release rate is reduced.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a one inch tank leak inside the storage enclosure.  The release rate to outside air is estimated to be 1 pound per minute which would impact to a distance of 0.1 miles or less at typical conditions.  This impact distance does not reach any off-site receptors.\n\nRegarding the Alternative Release Scenario, please note that any release within the storage enclosure would be exhausted to a 211 foot high exhaust stack.  The effect of exhausting to the stack was not modeled, however,"
