Steam is produced from turbine exhaust gases and used to load a power generator.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired combined-cycle unit exhaust, aqueous ammonia is injected into the exhaust stream.  The aqueous ammonia is stored in on-site in storage tanks. The storage capacity of each storage tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability, but the concentration of the aqueous ammonia is lower than the threshold for PSM highly hazardous chemicals set by OSHA.  Therefore, Wolf Hollow I is subject to RMP Program 2 requirements.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\nManagement System\nWolf Hollow I has developed a set of Management System procedures to manage implementation of the elements of the RMP program.  The management system details the scope, purpose, responsibilities and upkeep of each RMP element.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nWolf Hollow I maintains several technical documents to ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  The documents include information concerning the hazards of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is periodically reviewed and updated when necessary.\n\nHazard Analysis\nWolf Hollow I has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidelines from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  Wolf Hollow I has a system in"

The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel and are reviewed annually by team leaders.\n\nTraining\nAll operating personnel at Wolf Hollow I are initially trained in an overview of the aqueous ammonia process and the procedures for safely operating the process.  Operations personnel receive refresher training.   In addition, all employees are given general awareness training on RMP, the hazards of aqueous ammonia, and general emergency response.\n\nMaintenance\nWolf Hollow I has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identifiable equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWolf Hollow I promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prev"

These system include:\n- Pressure relief valves;\n- Shut off valves; and\n- Level gauges and indicators.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at Wolf Hollow in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nWolf Hollow I maintains a written defensive emergency action plan.  The plan addresses aspects of emergency actions including responsible personnel, medical emergencies, evacuation plans, personnel accounting, and in-plant notification of emergencies.  The emergency action plan is coordinated with the Hood County LEPC."
