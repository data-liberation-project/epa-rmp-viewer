      "SummaryText": "The Aspinwall Water Treatment Plant is operated and maintained by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA).  The plant complex is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on the north shore of the Allegheny River.  The plant includes river intakes, Chemical Building, Ross Pump Station, Clarifier Building, Sedimentation Basins, Filter Building, Clearwell, Aspinwall Pump Station and an Operations Center which houses an analytical laboratory and administrative staff.  The function of the Aspinwall Water Treatment Plant is to take water from the Allegheny River, treat it to meet drinking water quality standards, and distribute it for public use.  The ferric chloride that is delivered to the water treatment plant and used for treatment at the plant is a mixture with 1% by weight of anhydrous hydrogen chloride in solution. \n\nPWSA currently stores the ferric chloride solution in tanks located in the Chemical Building.  PWSA previously used railcars to store ferric chloride onsite.  While there are no railcars onsite at the plant at the present time, the worst-case release scenario modelled was from a railcar, given that PWSA has used railcars for this purpose in the past and may use railcars for ferric chloride storage in the future.\n\nThe onsite quantity of anhydrous hydrogen chloride of 9,400 pounds reported in Section 1.17.c.3 represents the sum of 6,493 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride reported by PWSA in the Tier II submission for 2022, plus the 2,914 pounds of potential future storage in two railcars.  This sum amount represents the amount of anhydrous hydrogen chloride that may be onsite in the future and is included for the purpose of Predictive Filing.\n\nThere was an incident on August 29, 2019, when a shipment of the ferric chloride mixture was inadvertently placed into the wrong storage tank due to human error.  The error was not discovered for approximately 24 hours and an unknown quantity of the vessel contents were mixed with treated water, and ultimat"

The tanks were cleaned and re-filled with designated product in the storage tank.  The removed product was disposed by PWSA by an approved waste vendor.  Weather conditions at the time of this incident are unknown.  Upon discovery, PWSA notified the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.  There were no on-site impacts and no known off-site impacts to other environmental receptors.  Following the incident, PWSA revised their procedures and implemented new Standard Operating Procedures for offloading chemicals.  The incident was not included in the 5-year Accident History section (Section 6) of the Risk Management Plan because there was no release of anhydrous hydrogen chloride to the environment.  It was only dosed into the water treatment process at a different location.\n\nRegarding Accident 2 Accident History in Section 6, the actual amount of anhydrous hydrogen chloride released was approximately 0.12 pounds.  The CDX program does not accept an amount less than one pound, so one pound was entered as the release amount in Accident 2 Section 6.5."
