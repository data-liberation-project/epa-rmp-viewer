These documents specify practices and procedures to help ensure the safety of our employees, our contractors, our community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nDetails of the emergency response efforts are contained in the above documents as well as the Texas Operations Emergency Plan.  This plan specifies the responsibilities and duties of Eastman personnel during emergencies and potential emergencies.  These responsibilities and duties provide for the prompt mobilization of the Company's resources, including both personnel and equipment in an emergency situation.  \r\n\r\nThese plans are updated routinely, and are periodically reviewed in their entirety.\r\n\r\nII.

Eastman has approximately 2,500 customers worldwide and posted 2010 sales of $5.84 billion.  With corporate headquarters in Kingsport, Eastman employs ~10,000 people in ~30 countries.\r\n\r\nThe Tyler Terminal facility is located on a 320-acre site in Smith County near Tyler, Texas.  The Tyler Terminal facility receives butane, ethylene, propane and propylene by pipeline and truck and stores these materials in above-ground tanks and in underground caverns in a salt dome formation over 1,000 feet below the surface.  There are no chemical manufacturing operations at the Tyler Terminal facility.  The materials received and stored at Tyler Terminal are sent by pipeline to the Texas Operations Longview site where they are used in the manufacture of over 40 different chemical intermediates, solvents, coatings, resins and plastics.  No consumer items are made directly at Texas Operations.  Instead, the Texas Operations products are supplied to industrial customers for use in the manufacture of hundreds of consumer items which enhance the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.  These products include automobile interiors, paints, tires, food preservatives, adhesives, furniture, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, disposable baby diapers, food packaging, toys, soft drink bottles, floor polish and waxes, printing inks, latex paint, fiberglass, fabric and many other consumer and industrial products.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Description\r\n\r\nThe Tyler Terminal facility handles a number of flammable gases listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.

This program covers six crafts and is registered by the U.S. Department of Labor.  Each trainee completes 367 to 506 hours of Related Instruction and another 5,000 to 6,000 hours of On-The-Job Learning, depending on the craft.  \r\n* Contract employees are required to have OSHA mandated training prior to performing work at Texas Operations.
