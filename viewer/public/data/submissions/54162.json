If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Forman Fire Department, or other authorities, to mimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia in nurse tanks for delivery to the farm for application. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 72400 lbs. in 11 nurse tanks.  There will be no transfering of productat the facility, it will be used as a staging area in season for delivering product to the loacal farmers.\n\n\n\nThe worst case senerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes. The maximum quanity would be 6581 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank capacity, as limited by design standards. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in this case would be 1.2 miles.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provissions of \"Safety Requirements for the Starage and Handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.\n\n\n\nDakota Plains Cooperative has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Ti"
