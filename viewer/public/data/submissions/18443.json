The accidental release prevention policy at this facility is to maintain this equipment in good operating condition, have the equipment inspected annually by the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia, utilize contractors that have experience and training with maintaining anhydrous ammonia systems, and maintain an attendant during the connection to and disconnection from the storage tanks by the delivery truck. A process safety management plan is in place and incorporated into this risk management plan. All work conducted on this system is done through the Facilities Engineering Leader. The Facilities Engineering Leader is the emergency coordinator and primarily responsible for the risk management plan and its implementation. \n\nEmergency Response Policies:\nThis facility is required to have an emergency and contingency plan under RCRA, a process safety management plan under OSHA, and a spill prevention control and counter measures plan. The policy of this facility is to maintain one unified plan that incorporates all aspects of the individual plans. The senior management of this facilty has a strong committment to safety as they are entering the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). In this program management is committed to taking a proactive actions to improve safety.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufacturers a varity of fittings, couplings, adapters and hose assemblies for the truck, industrial equipment, and agracultural industries. The stationary source is two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and the distribution piping. The ammonia is used to generate the proper atmosphere in furnaces to allow brazing on a mass production basis.\n\nScenario\u0012s:\nThe worst case scenario is the complete release of the contents of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.

This worst case scenario looks at the complete loss of the contents of one tank. This scenario does not consider the compounding effects of multiple vessels. The risk of the worst case scenario occuring is minimized by maintaining the tanks within a fenced and locked area. In addition the access drive to the tanks is controlled through a security gate. This limits access to the tanks and reduces the possibility of tampering. This scenario was analyzed by use of the computer modeling program RMP*Comp Ver. 1.04.

This scenerio was selected as the most probable release scenario. In this scenario it was assumed the tank reached the 250 psi relief valve setting and triggered a release.

Each of these individuals have a minimum of technicians level of training. Plant personnel are trained to notify the personnel listed on an Emergency Notification List when they discover an emergency situation. This call initiates the emergency plant response personnel and the emergency coordinator. These personnel then determine the type and degree of response necessary. The emergency coordinator is responsible for notifying the local emergency response agencies and activating the Van Wert Emergency Response Plan by dialing 911. This call will activate the Van Wert Emergency Management\u0012s response plan for the type of emergency in progress through the Van Wert City Police Department. Their responsibility is to the community within the affected area. The plant emergency coordinator is responsible for determining the type of response and/or evacuation necessory for all persons on the property dependent on the emergency situation. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nUpon completion of this plan this facility determined that no additional changes are necessary to improve the safety of the operation."
