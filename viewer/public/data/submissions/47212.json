We specialize in turkey with some pork and chicken. We average 28 million pounds of finished goods. At MTP we use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for our facility. We have 23,000 lbs. on site.\n\nAt MTP we have a two-temperature/pressure ammonia refrigeration system. The system is a single stage temperature that makes up two temperatures.\n\nMTP follows the OSHA 1910 Standards, RETA (Refrigeration Engineers and Technical Association) and IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) guidelines.\n\nOur ammonia vessels are located inside the facility and the valve stations are located on the roof. There are two ammonia sensors in the engine room set at 25 ppm and 50 ppm. Also each refrigerated make-up air unit has an ammonia sensor in it. To date we have not had a qualified \"accidental release\".\n\nThere are eight points of alarm monitoring in the engine room and there are six ammonia sensors in the facility. When an alarm is activated it will send an alarm to Security 24/7. Security will call management to determine the type of alarm. All alarms are handled with immediate response and investigation followed by necessary repair if needed. Alarm points consist of High Level Float on each system, High and Low suction pressures on each system and High discharge pressure. \n\nWe have an extensive Preventative Maintenance program. Listed are a few examples. We perform weekly inspections of our valve stations. We listen for excessive force while opening and closing. We inspect our defrost relief lines for frost. We turn all valves annually. We inspect our vessels monthly, quarterly and semi-annually and we test our float columns. We inspect the inside of our condensers annually. We calibrate our ammonia sensors semi-annually and we replace our ammonia sensors every two years. We also replace our safety "

      "SummaryText": "relief valves every five years.\n\nIn regards to mechanical repairs and maintenance, MTP will only make small/trained repairs. Our contractor will complete any major repairs or projects. MTP is very proactive with changes and repairs to help the system run more efficiently and successfully. With any welding, burning or other hot work to be performed on or near the refrigeration system MTP requires a Hot Work Permit. Proper use of this form requires that the person authorizing the permit exercise sound judgment when evaluating the hot work to be performed. His/her evaluation must consider the presence of combustible materials in the affected area, protective equipment used by workers on site, atmospheric conditions of the work area, and types of materials to be used in the hot work process, and general sources of combustion.  We also have a program and procedure for Line Breaks. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that MTP associates, contractors and company property are properly protected while engaged in: Breaking, disconnecting, or opening a line or hose that contains or has contained ammonia, performing service or maintenance on any refrigeration equipment that requires the isolation and opening the equipment, when a line is opened to change a seal or flange and performing tie-ins for modifications and/or additions to the system. A copy of the completed line break is kept on file for the life of the system.\n\nWe have Standard Operating Procedures written by a local third party refrigeration contractor. We just completed training on the SOPs and we are working on a more localized/specific training session for our associates. \n\nWe do bi-monthly awareness training and annual classroom training at our facility. These training sessions have focused on basic refrigeration, entry level training as suggested by our refrigeration contractor and SOP training. We also perform annual Mechanical Integrity inspection and a five-year in depth Mechanical Integrity inspection"

      "SummaryText": " by a third party contractor.\n\nAll associates are given brief awareness training during orientation. Those associate who work in an area that use anhydrous ammonia receives further training and safety awareness training for that job. Training is reviewed annually with current associates and immediately with new associates.\n\nAll contractors that work in the area of anhydrous ammonia are given safety awareness training before the job begins. They are made aware of the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and they are made aware of all exit routes and in-house shelter areas. We also review the work related injuries and illness for our refrigeration contractor annually. We discuss the injury/illness with our PSM group to evaluate the contractor. We also perform periodic audits on the contractor while they are on site to make sure safety regulations are being followed.\n\nOur local fire department has a HAZMAT program. We work with our local LEPC for coordination and emergency response. A few MTP associates have been FIT tested and trained how to use the full-face respirator.\n\nTo help improve our safety we are working on changing our in-house training program. We are looking into a more specific facility-training package for our mechanics that takes a closer look at our P&IDs, block flow diagram and our general refrigeration. We also want to work on how we handle an emergency situation as a whole plant, not just specific refrigeration personnel. After our SOPs were re-written a couple months back some very specific PMs were created for us and we are working on instituting them into our current system.\n\nOverall Michigan Turkey Producers feels we've taken the right steps to help our facility be a safe and well maintained facility for our associates and neighbors. We are a proactive facility and we want to do what's best for our community.\n\n"
