The facility will respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials, but may relay on local response agencies for large emergencies.  The facility management has a strong commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures.\n\nThe purpose of the BWGS Columbus 3 Natural Gas Storage facility is primarily for natural gas storage and distribution, with oil and natural gas production being actualized as a secondary process to this usage.  The facility currently has a 30,000-gallon liquids storage tank containing a mixture of flammable gases liquefied under pressure.  Natural gas liquid is processed on-site and distributed off-site via tanker truck.  The facility material max capacity weighs 179483 lbs, the offsite consequence analysis is based on the weight of the most flammable material and does not count the heavies that contribute to the max capacity but are not flammable.\n\nThe facility complies with 40 CFR Part 68, as well as several additional federal and state regulatory requirements related to accidental release prevention and emergency response.  The Columbus 3 Natural Gas Storage facility complies with following federal rules and regulations:  29 CFR (OSHA standards for worker protection), 40 CFR 112 (oil spill prevention), 40 CFR 122 (NPDES), 40 CFR 262 (generators of hazardous waste), and 40 CFR 192 (pipeline safety).  The facility also complies with the following state/local rules and regulations:  Part 5 Rules of Part 31 of P.A. 451 (spillage of oil and polluting materials), Part 615 of P.A. 451 (oil and gas regulations), Act 207 (fire prevention codes), Act 165 (gas safety standard).\n\nIt is important to note that facility construction is extremely geared towards safety and environmentally reliable equipment and management.  The control center is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including monitoring of a high techno"

All applicable equipment and storage areas associated with the natural gas liquids are under constant observation and evaluation, to provide effective measures at the site to prevent the potential for the release of natural gas liquids from these areas.\n\nThe purpose of the emergency response program is to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of non-hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to the air, soil, or surface water.  In the event of an emergency involving the natural gas liquids system, Columbus 3 employees will initiate a response appropriately.  If the emergency is beyond the facilities response capabilities, one or more local response agencies will be contacted and requested to respond to the emergency. Columbus 3 is a non-responding facility.\n\nThe Columbus 3 facility has ongoing training on a regular basis, including evaluation of any need for alternative mitigation or control equipment or technology, as well as the identification of any needed organizational changes, that serve to improve safety at the facility. The facility has not had any accidental releases in the last 5 years.\n\nThe Columbus 3 facility was purchased by WEC Energy Group July 1, 2017.  The facility has maintained compliance with the applicable regulations."
