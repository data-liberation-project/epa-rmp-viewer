PGM - Holland uses two chemicals that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules (40 CFR Part 68) to manufacture several pharmaceutical products including: Neurontin and Dilantin (seizure control); Benadryl (anti-histamine); and Accupril (anti-hypertension agent).  These chemicals are phosgene and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, and they are also regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary introduces the key components of the PGM - Holland risk management program including a description of the regulated substances, hazard assessments, accident prevention program, and emergency response program.  Specific elements of the PGM - Holland risk management program are presented in the attached Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nPGM - Holland has always acknowledged its civic responsibility to provide its colleagues and the residents of the Holland community with a safe facility.  PGM - Holland strives to meet or exceed applicable EPA and OSHA rules and regulations, and periodically evaluates the quality of its environmental and safety programs.  The facility's accident prevention and emergency response procedures have been designed to protect our colleagues, the community and environment, and PGM - Holland properties, to the greatest extent possible.  PGM - Holland maintains extensive on-site emergency response equipment and trained personnel, and has integrated its emergency response procedures with those of the Holland Township Fire Department and the Ottawa County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nThe designated representative and contact person for environmental matters and this Risk Management Plan at the PGM - Holland facility is Mr. Tom Bauer, Director of Materia"

He can be contacted at the facility at (616) 392-2375.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2 - SUBSTANCE PROPERTIES, RMP PROCESSES, AND WORST CASE HAZARD SCENARIO\n\n\n\nPhosgene and anhydrous hydrogen chloride are critical to the manufacture of several pharmaceutical products at the Holland, Michigan facility. Both chemicals require careful storage and handling due to their potential toxic hazards.  A detailed description of the chemical properties, regulated processes, process safety and control features, and the worst-case hazard scenario are provided below.\n\n\n\nChemical Properties\n\n\n\nPhosgene is a toxic and corrosive liquid with a boiling point of 47 oF.  Phosgene evaporates to form a gas at temperatures above the boiling point.  Exposure may cause severe irritation to the respiratory system, skin and eyes.  Inhalation of high concentrations of phosgene may cause headache, olfactory fatigue, respiratory irritation, difficulty breathing, lung congestion and, under extreme conditions, death.  In addition, symptoms may be delayed for a period of from 24 to 48 hours after exposure.  It is critical that persons exposed to phosgene seek immediate medical attention for prompt treatment.  The threshold quantity for phosgene is 500 pounds under the EPA RMP rules and 100 pounds under the OSHA PSM standard.  \n\n\n\nHydrogen chloride is a corrosive gas.  Exposure may cause severe irritation to the respiratory system, skin and eyes.  Inhalation of high concentrations of hydrogen chloride can cause respiratory irritation and corrosive burns, lung congestion, lung damage and, under extreme conditions, death. The threshold quantity for anhydrous hydrogen chloride is 5,000 pounds under both the EPA RMP rules and OSHA PSM standard.  \n\n \n\nThe EPA rules define a toxic endpoint for both phosgene and hydrogen chloride by reference to the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2), developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  The AIHA ERPG-2 is defi"

The AIHA ERPG-2 for phosgene is 0.2 parts per million (PPM) while the ERPG-2 for hydrogen chloride is 20 PPM.  \n\n\n\nPhosgene Process Safety\n\n\n\nPhosgene is used at the PGM - Holland facility to make three pharmaceutical products.  Phosgene is stored in 2,000-pound cylinders located in a secured storage area. When needed in the manufacturing process, phosgene cylinders are transported about 25 feet to a dedicated phosgene charging building.  Phosgene is then charged to a process reactor through a completely isolated system.  At no time during normal process operation is phosgene released to the atmosphere.  The phosgene process includes: cylinder storage; the phosgene charging building, distribution system and components; process equipment; process control and safety systems; and process scrubber systems.\n\n\n\nSince 1986, PGM - Holland has had the following safety measures in place to minimize the risk of an accidental release of phosgene.  These measures include:\n\n\n\n1. Phosgene cylinders are stored in a secure and fenced location that is dedicated to the storage of phosgene and hydrogen chloride cylinders.  Full cylinders are stored on a concrete pad and protected from direct exposure to sunlight.  The cylinder storage pad is isolated from other manufacturing activities.  Only DOT-approved shippers, or trained and certified PGM - Holland colleagues, are allowed to move and handle phosgene cylinders. \n\n\n\n2. Phosgene cylinders are constructed of 13/32\" thick steel in accordance with DOT regulations for over-the-road transportation. The cylinder ends are concave so that the two cylinder valves do not protrude beyond the end of the cylinder.  The two cylinder valves are capped to prev"

A flanged and gasketed leak-proof bonnet is bolted over and covers the two-capped cylinder valves, protecting the valves from damage and providing an additional barrier to prevent leakage to the environment. \n\n\n\n3. A dedicated phosgene cylinder charging building was constructed in 1986. This building eliminated the need to transport and use phosgene cylinders in process areas.  The building is located near the storage pad to minimize on-site transportation.  Phosgene cylinders have been used in this building since 1986 without a spill or leak incident adversely affecting the environment or community.\n\n\n\n4. The phosgene cylinder charging building contains a sump area designed to hold the contents of one phosgene cylinder. If a liquid phosgene spill were to occur, it would be contained within the charging building, and transferred from the sump to a process vessel for neutralization by the PGM - Holland Hazardous Materials Response Team. The sump area is also vented to a dedicated scrubber and thermal oxidizer system that would destroy any vaporized material.\n\n\n\n5. The phosgene cylinder rests securely within a steel cradle with the cylinder head inserted through a collar into a glove box located in the phosgene charging building.  The operator can remove the bonnet and make process connections to the cylinder only when the cylinder head is inserted into the glove box.  The air inside the glove box is continuously vented to a dedicated phosgene scrubber system.  The scubber destroys the small amount of phosgene that can be released into the glove box when the cylinder is disconnected from process piping.  The scrubber is then vented to a thermal oxidizer.  If a leak occurred, phosgene would be vented through the scrubber and thermal oxidizer system and not released to the environment.\n\n\n\n6. Liquid phosgene is piped to two reactor vessels through a double walled piping system.  An inner welded steel pipe is contained within an outer glass pipe that is prot"

In addition, all phosgene valves are contained within valve boxes that are vented to the phosgene scubber system.  The design of the valve boxes and double piped distribution system provides for phosgene containment from the cylinder valve to the reactor.  If a leak occurred, phosgene would be vented to the scrubber and thermal oxidizer system and not released to the environment.\n\n\n\n7. \n\nNitrogen, an inert gas, is used to push phosgene from the cylinder through the double walled piping system to the reactor.  Nitrogen is supplied from a dedicated bulk tank.  Bottled nitrogen provides a backup source should the primary nitrogen source fail.  Nitrogen pressure is controlled and process interlocks prevent phosgene from entering the nitrogen supply systems.  \n\n\n\n8. A 16-point phosgene monitoring system continuously samples plant and process areas likely to be affected by a phosgene leak.  The system will activate an alarm and automatically stop the phosgene charge.  The monitoring system minimizes any potential leak by automatically closing all phosgene feed control valves when the leak is detected.\n\n\n\n9. Phosgene is used in only two reactor vessels. Both reactors are glass lined and meet the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) codes for pressure vessels. Phosgene is charged while the reactor is being vented through the scrubber system to the thermal oxidizer.  Reactors are equipped with high and low-temperature sensors that stop the phosgene charge if unusual process conditions occur.  A high-pressure sensor stops the phosgene charge if reactor pressure exceeds 1 pound per square inch (PSI).  Emergency cooling can be provided to the reactor jacket to help slow or stop an unusually fast phosgene reaction. Manual emergency stop buttons are provided in the phosgene cylinder charging building and near each rea"

Multiple rupture disks prevent leakage to the environment.  A safety relief valve would stop vessel venting after excess pressure was vented from the reactor.  Emergency venting would also activate a pressure sensor and phosgene monitor located in the vent line that would stop the phosgene charge.  \n\n\n\n11. Phosgene scrubbers are equipped with high and low-level alarms, and a low caustic flow alarm that stops the phosgene charge if the scrubber caustic circulation stops.\n\n\n\n12. All manufacturing facilities have been designed to minimize the potential for fire.  The phosgene storage pad, cylinder charging and process buildings are constructed from non-combustible materials.  These facilities are equipped with Class 1, Division 1, Group D, rated electrical equipment.  The cylinder charging building is isolated from the storage and use of flammable liquids and plant process areas.  A fixed fire protection system with aqueous film forming foam has been installed in all plant process areas.  All hot work is controlled through a permit system. \n\n\n\n13. Detailed mechanical and electrical system inspections and tests are conducted on the phosgene charging and distribution systems, process control and safety equipment.  Phosgene piping and process vessels are pressure tested immediately prior to phosgene use to minimize the potential for a process leak.\n\n\n\n14. Process operators working with phosgene have been trained and certified by PGM - Holland in accordance with OSHA PSM standard requirements.  Process operators are required to follow written process operating procedures contained in batch cards that cover phosgene charging, processing, and emergency response.  \n\n\n\n15.

The Haz-Mat team has conducted emergency response drills for potential phosgene leaks and emergencies.\n\n\n\nPGM - Holland has recently improved phosgene process control by upgrading to a distributed control system (DSC) which allows improved process monitoring, operational control, and alarm notification and response.  The phosgene monitoring system, reactor temperature and pressure sensors, scubber controls, and other controls and interlocks have been integrated into the DSC.\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen Chloride Process Safety\n\n\n\nHydrogen chloride is stored at the PGM - Holland facility in two different manners.  Hydrogen chloride is stored in 600-pound cylinders adjacent to where phosgene cylinders are stored.  The total amount of hydrogen chloride contained in cylinder storage at any given time may exceed the applicable RMP rule threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nHydrogen chloride is also stored in a bulk storage area consisting of six 3,500-pound cylinders supported by a DOT approved trailer.  The facility has unloading facilities for three trailers.  One trailer will normally be in transport while a second is in backup status. Only one cylinder of one trailer can actively supply the facility's bulk hydrogen chloride distribution system at any given time.

All colleagues not on the Haz-Mat team, contractors and visitors, would evacuate the plant if a hydrogen chloride release were to occur.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe EPA rules required the development of worst-case release scenarios that assume the entire contents of the largest container of a highly hazardous chemical are released in ten minutes under adverse weather conditions.  PGM - Holland developed a worst case release scenario for phosgene based on the maximum cylinder quantity of 2,000 pounds.  Weather conditions assume a 98 oF ambient temperature, 73% relative humidity, 3.4 mile per hour (1.5 meter per second) wind speed, and F class atmospheric stability.  The worst case modeling was conducted using the EPA approved SLAB model for dense gases.

PGM - Holland believes that the described scenarios for phosgene and hydrogen chloride are highly unlikely to occur due to the high level of process safety and the associated PGM - Holland process safety management and emergency response programs. PGM - Holland believes that any phosgene or hydrogen chloride release would have substantially less impact on potential environmental and public receptors than the described alternative scenarios.  Specifically, the phosgene alternative release scenario requires the simultaneous failure of multiple process control and safety systems, and the complete release of reactor contents without any response by chemical operators or the Haz-Mat team to minimize or respond to the release.\n\n\n\nPhosgene\n\n\n\nPhosgene is used in two batch records.  In one batch record, an initial 440-pound charge of phosgene is made to the reaction mixture.  The reaction undergoes a small temperature increase as the reaction is initiated.  Once initiated, phosgene reacts as it enters the reactor and does not accumulate in an appreciable quantity.  The only potential for any significant phosgene release is during the period of reaction initiation.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes that the full 440-pound phosgene charge is released through the reactor emergency vent as a gas at a temperature of 149 oF and an elevation of 22 feet under typical weather conditions.  Weather conditions assume a 48 oF ambient temperature, 62% relative humidity, 9.1 mile per hour (4.1 meter per second) wind speed measured at 9 meters and corrected to ground level, and D atmospheric stability.

Continuous air monitoring equipment confirmed the presence of phosgene inside the manufacturing building at a peak concentration of about 0.65 parts per million.  Several colleagues who worked in the general area of the release were sent to a medical clinic for observation but no injuries were reported. It was estimated that less than one pound of phosgene was released.  The incident was investigated and corrective actions were taken.\n\n\n\nOn April 27th, a contractor employee experienced respiratory irritation and chest tightness and stated that he had smelled phosgene the previous day.  The contractor was sent to a local medical clinic as a precaution.  He was given a prescription medication and returned to work.
