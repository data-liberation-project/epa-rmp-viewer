We also provide the Fire Department with Tier II notification of our inventory on a yearly basis. Water Guard  has a Chlorine Institute Emergency A-Kit on site.

The Wilson Facility repackages a variety of water treatment  chemicals and warehouses others. Safe handling and shipment is critical for our employees, our customers, and the surrounding communities. We employ 28 including 14  trained hazmat drivers.  These drivers  handle 150 lb chlorine cylinders for temporary storage and delivery. Chlorine  gas, a strong disinfectant, can be toxic in high concentrations but is critical to providing safe drinking water for many localities in NC. The facility operates approximately 12 hrs. per day and has 24 hr. surveillance.  The facility is in the proximity to other commercial buildings areas and a residential area. The risk of off-site effects are  unlikely, and  in the past twenty years there have been no facility accidents involving a reportable release of this chemical. Less than catastrophic releases would be minimized within the building.\nThe chlorine  cylinders are received from the supplier, leak checked, and stored in secured cages.  The products are liquefied gases under low pressure (25-125 psi).  The cylinders are DOT specification heavy-walled cylinders that are not opened or modified by Water Guard inc . They are built to withstand normal and accident conditions incident to transportation. Our supplier inspects the cylinders each time they are filled and hydrostatically pressure tests the cylinders every 5 years to 500 psi. Chlorine Institute training materials are used and are the source of the written procedures, Safety Data Sheets and Safety checklists  provide  industry standards .\nSince there are no inter-container transfers, the most viable threat of release from these transportation cylinders would be  from the fusible valve fuse plug that activates at 160 deg F in a fire. In addition, trace leaks may result from"
