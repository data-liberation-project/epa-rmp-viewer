With our innovative products, we are contributing to finding solutions to some of the major challenges of our time. Bayer employs nearly 100,000 people globally, with about 19,000 employees in North America. The Muscatine facility is part of the Bayer Crop Science division, with U.S. headquarters (Bayer CropScience LP) located at 800 N Lindbergh Blvd in Creve Coeur, Missouri.\n\n\n\nOne of the locations contributing to this vision is Bayer's manufacturing facility located in Muscatine, Iowa, at 2500 Wiggens Road.  Approximately 430 employees at this facility manufacture a variety of herbicide active ingredients and formulate them into finished goods for consumer use.\n\nThe major elements of the RMP prevention program are very similar to the OSHA PSM regulation.  OSHA has conducted an audit of our facility under their Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and, in 1995, the Muscatine Plant was awarded their highest rating - \"Star\".  Since then the Muscatine Plant has demonstrated commitment to continuing improvement to the safety and health of employees and the surrounding community.  This is shown through both our internal VPP Audits and OSHA's recertification audits.  The plant has been recertified for VPP Star status multiple times including the latest recertification audit in September 2019.\n\nBayer's Muscatine, Iowa facility has a documented Emergency Response plan that complies with the NIMS (National Incident Management System) standard with the associated personnel and training and includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events, including inclement weather, fire and toxic chemical releases.  There are personnel responsible for implementation of thi"

In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the Muscatine County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Fruitland Volunteer Fire Department.  The Plant also has Mutual Aid Agreements with all Muscatine County and Louisa County Fire Departments.  Should an incident occur which could jeopardize the safety and health of personnel in the area surrounding the Bayer plant, the following events would occur:\n\n\n\n    - Bayer's emergency response team would be called upon to control the incident,\n\n    - The Muscatine County Sheriff would be notified, and\n\n    - The community emergency response resources would be called upon for assistance.\n\n\n\nThe plant Emergency Response Team (ERT) consists of a Fire Brigade, a HazMat Team, a Medical Group and a Rescue Team.  Ideally the ERT has 50 members, however the number can fluctuate with personnel changes over the year.  Emergency response equipment in the plant is strategically located at various points with the larger vehicles and mobile equipment located at the Safety Services Building for quick response.  These larger vehicles and mobile equipment consist of:\n\n\n\n    - Fire Engine\n\n    - Hazmat Truck\n\n    - Ambulance\n\n    - Breathing Air Trailer\n\n    - Foam Trailer, and\n\n    - Triage Trailer\n\n\n\nOther equipment is placed throughout the plant for quick response and includes (but is not limited to) fire water monitors, sprinkler and deluge systems, spill response kits, absorbent materials, Industrial Hygiene monitoring equipment, bunker gear, Level A Suits, and SCBAs.  Much of the equipment used throughout the plant for routine purposes can also perform secondary functions during an emergency if needed.\n\n\n\nThis facility maintains an inventory of four chemicals regulated by the RMP:  ammonia, chlorine, formaldehyde, and isopropyl amine.

      "SummaryText": "ces of several release scenarios for each chemical have been calculated using methods provided by the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for each chemical requires that the entire contents of the vessel be discharged to the atmosphere in a 10 minute period.  This would be an extremely rare event and very unlikely to occur.   The worst case toxic release scenario for this plant involves the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a chlorine rail car.   The worst case scenario for a flammable is similarly the complete and instantaneous release of a full rail car of isopropyl amine and a resulting vapor cloud explosion.  \n\n\n\nThe regulation also requires an analysis of alternate release scenarios.  Bayer has evaluated several release scenarios for each chemical, including unloading hose failure, rupture of the largest nozzle on the storage tank or rail car, and relief device failure.\n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, the facility has had no accidental release from a covered process that meets the EPA RMP criteria for reporting.  \n\n\n\nThe Muscatine Plant employs a comprehensive collection of safety systems to maintain the equipment and work practices utilized in our operation.  Some examples include:\n\n\n\n  - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted a minimum of every 5 years.  This involves a team of experts who review the hazards posed by the chemical, best industry practices for handling the material and a defined system to identify hazards.  Recommendations for improvement are made and priority placed on implementing them in a prompt manner.\n\n\n\n  - Our mechanical integrity system requires regular inspection of the equipment, relief devices and other systems utilized in handling the material.\n\n\n\n  - Procedures have been developed to provide detailed actions for employees operating the equipment.  These procedures are developed and reviewed with active involvement from operating personnel, and are certified annually.\n\n\n\n  - A change management system is utilized for"

      "SummaryText": " modifications to equipment and operating parameters.  Each change is appropriately reviewed by a team of personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\n\n\n  - The site utilizes a number of contract personnel for a variety of services.  Our Contractor/Guest program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria and open communication must exist between Bayer and contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we utilize a number of systems for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\n\n\n\n    - Area monitors to quickly detect leaks,\n\n    - Emergency chlorine tank car repair kit,\n\n    - Water sprinkler systems to extinguish process fires, and\n\n    - Excess flow valves which will stop chlorine flow or ammonia flow under certain conditions.\n\n\n\nBoth the general and chemical specific systems work together to minimize the frequency and consequences of chemical releases.\n\n\n\nOver the next 5 years the plant plans to continue to improve safety through continuation of participation in programs like VPP, continuing internal programs like the Behavior Based Safety (BBS) observations, as well as conducting audits as required by PSM and RMP.  In addition, specific plans include performing internal audits focusing on Process Safety improvements, and modifying the plant training program to include more rigorous feedback processes in all areas of training.\n\n\n\nThis brief summary provides some insight into the extensive system Bayer utilizes to maintain safe operations.
