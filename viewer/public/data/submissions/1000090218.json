Stored bulk products are canned for distribution to retailers.  This plant has a closed loop refrigeration system containing ammonia for maintaining product and room temperatures.\n\n\n\nRegulated substance handled:\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only covered chemical at the plant and is highly valued for its use in the plant refrigeration system. It is used to remove heat from rooms to maintain the correct temperatures, as required by the products being prepared and stored in them. Additionally, it provides the means to maintain specified temperature by removing heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the plant and is compressed, condensed and evaporated as a part of this cycle.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers and reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this plant.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nIt is the intent of this plant to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nThe plant Utility Specialists are trained using various methods such as; on the job training and contractor training and explanation (contractors are members of IIAR).\n\nOur policies consist of having a preventative maintenance program conducted by plant staff and the refrigeration contractor and employees are trained to insure adequate response to equipment integrity. Employees are initially trained and have refresher training in the operation of the ammonia refrig"

The plant is typically staffed 24/7 and therefore can responds to any system alarms. An ammonia detection system within the compressor room is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed. The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.\n\nAccidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\nAll elements of the PSM/RMP are followed and the process has numerous safe guards including:\n\n  \n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\n  \n\nIn areas where forklifts are utilized, all ammonia lines are elevated or protected by barriers to eliminate any contact; forklift drivers are trained on the hazards in their work areas.\n\n  \n\nThe plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.\n\n  \n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in 2020.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents (none reportable); (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility sighting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.\n\n  \n\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, "

Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective and receives on-site contractor training each year.\n\nThe plant has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nThe plant has had no reportable RMP qualifying releases in the past five year history.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nThe plant has an emergency response program based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The Crisis Management Policy (QM-5.41) includes in-house procedures in the event of a release, procedures for notification of the local fire authority and local emergency response agencies who will also notify any potentially affected neighbors. The plant Crisis Management Policy is based on known applicable regulations and requirements and responders are trained as required.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nIdentification of opportunities and changes to improve safety is part of the culture of this plant. In addition to the plant programs mentioned above, the following changes are planned.\n\n*    Evaluation of staffing to support system maintenance and rapid response.\n\n*    Redundancy in training (cross-training) for monitoring refrigeration processes\n\n*    Plan to install check valves on the ammonia charge line.\n\n*    Plan to lock the ammonia charging line.\n\n*    Project related contractors receive on-site training including an overview of ammonia process\n\n"
