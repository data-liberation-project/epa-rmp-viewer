This facility is a commercial bakery, which operates a single ammonia system to cool bread products prior to distribution and chill glycol for cooling mixing equipment.  This program has been prepared pursuant to Part 68, Subpart G of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\r\n\r\nThe system contains approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum quantity of ammonia contained on site is approximately 20,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, Maple Leaf has developed the following: \r\n\r\n- \tMaintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and functioning properly.\r\n-\tOperating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a manner that minimizes the possibility of an ammonia release.\r\n- \tEmployee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and non-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps to take in the event of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nThe programs are contained in Binder 4: Ammonia Operating Procedures.\r\n\r\nThe general emergency response policy for the site when ammonia is released is to evacuate to an area upwind of the release and notify the appropriate personnel and authorities.  Trained personnel will then assess whether to evacuate the facility, and determine the appropriate level of response.  A copy of the Emergency Response Plan for Maple Leaf can be found in Binder 3.  A description of the ERP is contained in Section 6.0 Emergency Response Program in this document.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Substance Handled\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Maple Leaf operates a single ammonia cooling system to cool and/or freeze bread products prior to shipment, and to chill glycol for on site material mixing. \r\n\r\n\fAccid"

This was done to simulate a compressor seal failure, which was identified as the most common mode of failure in this type of ammonia system that could result in a release.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the distance to the endpoint from an accidental release, the following administrative controls and mitigation measures are in place at Maple Leaf:\r\n\r\n- \tRegular maintenance on the equipment.\r\n- \tDaily inspections of equipment.\r\n- \tComputer monitoring system.\r\n\r\nDetails regarding the offsite consequence analysis for the worst case and alternative release scenarios can be found in Section 3.0 of this document.\r\n\r\n\fGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Components and Substance Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following components are contained in the following sections of this Risk Management Plan document:\r\n\r\n- \tRegistration\r\n- \tOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n- \tFive-year Accident History\r\n- \tProgram Specific Component\r\n- \tEmergency Response Program\r\n- \tCertification\r\n- \tUpdate Procedure\r\n\r\nIn order to further mitigate the effects of a ammonia release, the following risk management components are in place:\r\n\r\n- \tMain"

This will help prevent disgruntled employees and vandals from operating the solenoid switches that are designed to prevent material releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\nUpdate the ammonia system inspection procedures. The equipment in the compressor room should be checked at least once per shift, preferably two (2) or three (3) times per shift (every two or three hours). In addition, the ammonia equipment located on the roof should be visually inspected at least once per day. There are no sensors on the roof, thus if routine visual inspections are not performed regularly, a small ammonia leak could exist for"

This will help ensure the safety of the person performing the rooftop inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\nEvaluate improving the security of the compressor room. This may be accomplished either by changing the locks on the doors to the compressor room to account for personnel changes or by installing a keypad system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\nEnsure P&ID is updated to reflect actual facility construction (remove the HSD line to LT-1 and move bleed-off valves to side of rooftop piping).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\nTest the ammonia sensors at least every year to ensure they are functioning properly and replace them per manufacturer recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\nEnsure evacuation drills are performed at least once per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\nLabel the King Valve on the High Pressure Receiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\nLock the hatch to the roof when not in use.
