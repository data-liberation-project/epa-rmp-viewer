There are a total of five screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. There are two swing compressors that can operate on the high or low temperature system. There are three additional compressors that operate on the low temperature system with side porting capability to the high temperature system.\n\nThere are two separate recirculator packages: one low temperature system operating at -22A?F and a high temperature unit operating at +22A?F. The low temperature recirculator package feeds twenty eight evaporator units. The high temperature recirculator unit feeds the twelve dock units. Hot gas defrost is employed for daily defrosting of evaporators.\n\nThere are two rooftop mounted evaporative condensers with a remote sump. There are also three glycol plate and frame heat exchangers used for under floor heating. A Hansen auto-purger is also used to remove non-condensable materials.\n\nProcess Description\nLiquid Side\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers. The condensers remove heat from superheated vapor discharged from the compressors. This changes the state of the ammonia from vapor to liquid. This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 and EC-2 via two 2 1/2-inch pipes and flows to the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1).\n\nThe Thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid to each screw compressor for cooling of the oil via a six inch supply line. These oil coolers are mounted on the side of each screw compressor unit. The refrigerant in the oil coolers naturally recirculates to and from the Thermosyphon Receiver when there is a heat load.\n\nThe high-pressure liquid also leaves the Thermosyphon Receiver via a A? inch line which feeds the Hansen autopurger unit and a four inch line which feeds the High Temperature Recirculator (V-2). The High Temperature Recirculator is o"

      "SummaryText": "perated at +22A?F. The liquid supply to V-2 is controlled by a float switch and solenoid valve.\n\nThe liquid from the High Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the dock and cooler evaporators, the Alpha-Laval heat exchanger and the dock evaporators. The liquid is also pumped to the low temperature recirculator (V-3). \n\nThe Low Temperature Recirculator is operated at -22A?F. A float switch and solenoid valve device controls the liquid supply to V-3. The liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the freezer air units.\n\nVapor Side\nThe Compressors remove the vapors from both the High Temperature Recirculator and the low temperature recirculator vessels.\n\nScrew compressors: All screw compressors are capable of being used to remove vapors from either the High Temperature Recirculator or the Low Temperature Recirculator.\n\nThe discharge of all the compressors, C-1 through C-5, is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the Condenser unit. The condensers remove heat from superheated vapor discharged from the compressors. This changes the state of the ammonia from vapor to liquid. \n\nSome of the superheated discharge vapors, also referred to as hot gas are sent to the two floor heaters. These floor heaters condense the vapors and utilize this removed heat for increasing the temperature of the glycol. This warmed glycol is then utilized for keeping the freezer floor temperature above freezing. Additionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium. This defrost gas is sent to the Air Units AU-1 through AU-40 for removal of ice that has built up on the coils.\n\nDefinitions\nThermosyphon System\nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the compressor units. This liquid utilizes a shell and tube or plate and frame heat exchanger to keep the compressor's oil cooled and thus allowing the units to operate at the manufacturer's recomm"

The denser liquid (supply) displaces the lighter vapor-liquid mixture thus pushing the mixture out of the heat exchanger and back to the Thermosyphon Receiver. This difference in density creates natural circulation.\n\nSingle Stage Compression System\nA single stage compressor system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system. Each compressor discharges directly to the condenser units via a common header.\n\nRecirculator System\nA recirculator system is a combination of a vessel, pumps, valves and other components used to feed a refrigeration circuit. The pumps supply liquid to the various evaporators. \n\nThe outlet of the evaporators(consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor. The application can be either a low temp or high temp application. The liquid feed can be sub-cooled through an intercooler or fed directly from the receiver.\n"
