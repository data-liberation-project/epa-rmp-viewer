It is Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nProducers Dairy Foods, Inc. owns and operates a milk and milk products processing facility located on East Belmont Avenue in Fresno, California.  The corporate office and mailing address is 250 E. Belmont.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia-based refrigeration system at Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. provides cooling for the raw milk tanks, process equipment (water chiller, glycol chillers, and ice makers), pasteurized milk tanks, cold storage rooms, and two cold storage warehouses.  The major components of the refrigeration system are:\n\ncompressors\n\nevaporative condensers\n\nhigh pressure receiver\n\nrecirculator package\n\nflooded evaporators (cold storage warehouses)\n\ndirect expansion evaporators (cold storage rooms)\n\nglycol chillers\n\nwater chiller\n\nice builders\n\nsuction accumulators\n\n\n\nThe largest vessel in the refrigeration system at Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. in the high pressure receiver.  \n\n\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Producers Dairy Foods, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.

The Operations Director has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration "
