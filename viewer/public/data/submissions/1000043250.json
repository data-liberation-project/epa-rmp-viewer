The registration for this process is presented in the GRM-PG - Appendix A. \n\n\n\nThe NWWTP is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the NWWTP utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. The NWWTP is located at 701 Executive Center Boulevard in the western portion of the City of El Paso, Texas. The NWWTP is surrounded by commercial, industrial, residential, and vacant land and is approximately 3/4 miles north of the state boundary with New Mexico and the International Boundary with Mexico, and approximately 1/2 mile east of the Rio Grande River.\n\n\n\nCurrently the NWWTP has the potential to store up to seven (7) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room, allowing the potential to store a total of 14,000 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is three (3) one-ton chlorine containers at any one time. The average amount of chlorine managed at NWWTP is 6,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 3 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 50,500 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population resides in the worst case vulnerable zone.  The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\n\n \n\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the "

The NWWTP is approximately two-thousand (2,000) feet east of the Rio Grande River.  The Rio Grande River provides habitat for aquatic wildlife and recreation.  The International Boundary with Mexico consists of the Rio Grande River, which is located approximately four-thousand (4,000) feet south of NWWTP at the Americas Damn, where the International Boundary is divided  between the Rio Grande River and a non-geographic boundary traversing west between Mexico and New Mexico.  At the Americas Damn, the Rio Grande River travels north into Texas and New Mexico.  The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC)is the responsible agency that monitors the ecosystem of the Rio Grande River along the International Boundary.   \n\n\n\n?    Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n\n\n\n?
