The design capacity for the WWTP is 2,000,000 gallons per day (gpd) average daily flow, and 8,000,000 gpd peak hydraulic flow.  The WWTP treats wastewater from the District and several other utility districts in the area.  The influent that comes in to the WWTP is subject to several different treatment processes before it is discharged in to Cypress Creek.  One of the last treatment processes is disinfecting the effluent just before it is discharged.  Gaseous chlorine is used to disinfect the effluent and sulfur dioxide is used to neutralize excess chlorine in the effluent before discharge. \nBecause chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used, the District is responsible for submitting a Risk Management Plan for the WWTP to the Environmental Protection Agency (?EPA?).  The EPA published 40 CFR 68 on June 20, 1996.  This rule lists 77 regulated toxic substances and 63 regulated flammables.  Each of these toxic substances has a threshold quantity (?TQ?).  Gaseous chlorine, for instance, has a TQ of 2,500 Ibs. and sulfur dioxide has a TQ of 5,000 lbs.  The WWTP has a maximum of 4,000 Ibs. of gaseous chlorine and 4,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide on site under certain conditions. Chlorine is the only regulated toxic chemical the WWTP stores in an amount greater than the TQ.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe District has charged its operator, Water District Management, Inc. (?WDM?), with the duty of operating a safe WWTP.  WDM uses several methods in order to safely operate the District?s WWTP.  They must practice good preventive maintenance, timely corrective maintenance, and hire/train employees that are knowledgeable in the safe handling of gaseous chlorine and ga"

      "SummaryText": "seous chlorine equipment.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nIn addition to properly selected, handled and maintained equipment, the facility includes a comprehensive chlorine detection and alarm system.  The system consists of low and high gas concentration detectors.  The low concentration detector notifies the operator by an automatic alarm telephone dialer.  After being alerted by the auto-dialer, the operator will assess the situation and do what is necessary to prevent a minor leak from graduating to a major leak.  If a high level alarm is reached, the operator will evacuate the premises and allow the Klein Volunteer Fire Department to handle the situation.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nNo accidents, including releases, have occurred in the past five years.  The District and WDM strive to maintain that record.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nIf a vapor cloud is suspected, it is recommended that you immediately go indoors (do not try to outrun the cloud as you may not be running away from it, but instead right in to it), turn off the air conditioning system, and stuff wet towels in all cracks such as under doors and around windows.\nSigns with emergency phone numbers are posted on the gate of the WWTP.  It may be a good idea to write these phone numbers down and keep them with other emergency phone numbers you may already have.  After you have found refuge indoors, ensure that the Klein Volunteer Fire Department has been notified at (281) 893-3353.  Do not return outdoors until you have received an ?all clear? signal from the fire department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nRecommendations are generated for improving operations and reducing risks on an ongoing basis.  The contractor that performs the semi-annual preventive maintenance is continually asked for recommendations to improve the safety of the installation.  All employees are required to attend training which includes safety reviews and newest trends "
