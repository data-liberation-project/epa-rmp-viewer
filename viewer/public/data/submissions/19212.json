      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCenex Harvest States is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from any hazardous substances used in our soybean processing and refining operation.  This facility strives to comply with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emegency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Mankato Fire Department and request that they respond to our emergency.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nCenex Harvest States operates a soybean processing and vegetable oil refining facility in Mankato, Minnesota.  The plant receives soybeans and through several processes extracts soybean oil for use in food products.  Hydrogenation is a step in the processing of soybean oil.  Hydrogenation is the process by which hydrogen gas is reacted with the soybean oil.  The hydrogenation process requires the use of natural gas or propane to produce the hydrogen gas used.  The maximum amount of propane stored on-site is estimated to be 110,000 pounds.  The propane is stored as a compressed liquid and is vaporized prior to process usage.  In addition to its use as a backup feedstock in the hydrogen plant, propane is used as a backup to natural gas for combustion processes at the plant.  The propane system consists of one 30,000 gallon tank and the associated piping, valves. and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by the RMP Guidance is the failure of the propane storage tank and the release of the entire maximum inventory of 110,000 pounds resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to endpoint.  The alternative release scenario is a hose ruture caused by a transfer vehicle pull-away resulting in a vapor clou"

The resulting distance to endpoint does not extend off-site and would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility's process safety management program serves as the prevention program.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nCenex Harvest States has not had a propane accident causing deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the City of Mankato Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have observed our propane system.  In the event of an accident the facilities emergency preparedness plan is used to notify the appropriate agencies to respond to the incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe process safety and risk management programs are ongoing, and changes are being implemented as appropriate."
