The plant is situated just east of Interstate Highway 210 and south of State Highway 30, covering approximately 140 acres.  The plant was built in 1940 to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  It was designed to process 520 million gallons of water a day (520 mgd).  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nThe Chlorine System at the Weymouth Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to heat chlorine and convert it to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment system for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels, evaporators, chlorinators and injectors are totally contained in the chlorination facility storage bays within the chlorine containment building.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe Chlorine System is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras and chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator room, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.

MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the 20th century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F. E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.

The Weymouth Plant complies with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.  \n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\n\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of chlorine.  This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for chlorine process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  The Weymouth Plant also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1992, 1995, 1998, and 2004, detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the Chlorine System equipment and procedures.  The PHA was further reviewed and revalidated in July 2009.  A list of recommended actions was developed in July 2009 to further improve chlorine safety and staff has evaluated these recommendations and are documenting the resolution of recommended actions.\n\nAn update of the January 20"

      "SummaryText": "05 CalARP seismic risk assessment was completed for the modified chlorination facility in January 2010.  Based on Region 1 LEPC CalARP Seismic Update Guidance, recommendations were provided to Weymouth Plant staff for their evaluation and resolution.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Weymouth Plant maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the chlorine process.  The Weymouth Plant ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the Chlorine System.  The operating procedures include connection/disconnection for chlorine storage vessel, start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, after maintenance start-up for chlorine evaporators, maintenance shutdown for chlorine evaporators, start-up and shutdown for ejectors, start-up and shutdown for chlorinators, startup and shutdown for chlorine scrubber, Chlorine System emergency shutdown, start-up following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  Also included are the maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to correct or avoid deviations. \n\nWeymouth Plant updates procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nWeymouth Plant employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process are trained in an overview of the process and detailed applicable operating and maintenance procedures. Weymouth Plant ensures that each employee newly assigned to the process, is trained, tested and certified in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their dutie"

The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.\n \nIncident Investigation\n\nWeymouth Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Weymouth Plant Chlorine System.\n\nThe Five-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Weymouth Plant during the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program Summary\n\nMWD is currently a non-responding agency and relies on external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department, to handle an emergency chlorine release. Weymouth Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Los Angeles County Fire Department and La Verne City Fire) to help ensure familiarity with the Weymouth Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in the LEPC Area Plans. Conservatively trained Weymouth Plant operations and maintenance employees will be available in the event of a chlorine emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders and may only respond to incidental chlorine releases, as defined by MWD\u00c2\u00bfs spill response program, EPA and CalOSHA requirements and related guidance docume"

These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in July 2009 and January 2010, when the process hazard and seismic risk analyses were reviewed and revalidated for the chlorine containment and scrubbing system.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and will be resolved in a timely fashion."
