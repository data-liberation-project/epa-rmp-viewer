      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the 20th century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F. E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWDSC has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\nWeymouth PlantA?s chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which wil"

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nA? The five-year accident history.\nA? The emergency response program.\nA? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAn RMP for the Weymouth Plant Chlorination Facility was prepared and submitted to the EPA in June 2004, to comply with the five-year RMP update requirement.  As discussed in the Executive Summary of the June 2004 RMP submission under A?Planned Changes to Improve Safety,A? MWDSC modified the Weymouth Plant Chlorination Facility with a chlorine containment and scrubbing system to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release.  The decision to install the chlorine containment and scrubbing system was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The Chlorine containment and scrubbing process modification was placed in operation and a revised RMP was submitted in 2005, and is currently in operation.\n\nThe information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the chlorine containment and handling facility at Weymouth.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.

The plant is situated just east of Interstate Highway 210 and south of State Highway 30, covering approximately 140 acres.  The plant was built in 1940 to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  It was designed to process 520 million gallons of water a day (520 mgd).  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nThe Chlorine System at the Weymouth Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to heat chlorine and convert it to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment system for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels, evaporators, chlorinators and injectors are totally contained in the chlorination facility storage bays within the chlorine containment building.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own vapor pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe Chlorine System is continuously monitored in the control room by video cameras and chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator room, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.
