EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n \n The facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with potential accidents related \nto the covered process. The plan includes first aid response, notification of emergency \nresponders and evacuation. Tenneco employees do not directly respond to incidents such as \nfires beyond the incipient stage. The emergency response plan is communicated to employees \nand updated as needed.\n \n7.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n \n Tenneco is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The NAPP division of \nTenneco has aggressive environmental and safety goals. Corporate EH&S personnel assist \nfacilities in developing programs to meet these goals. The Glens Falls facility has an EH&S \nManager to coordinate safety and environmental programs.\n \n This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that \ncovers design, installation, operation, maintenance and training for processes at the Glens Falls \nfacility.  In the event any unforeseeable release might still occur, the facility coordinates \nemergency response primarily with local fire departments. The Warren County LEPC is also made \naware of our storage of flammable substances.\n \n2. GLENS FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n \n The Glens Falls facility manufactures packaging materials including padded mailers, polyethylene \nfoam in the form of sheets and planks and polyethylene bubble. The foam process uses a \nregulated flammable gas as a blowing agent. The maximum inventory at the facility is about \n68,000 pounds. The maximum in one tank is about 48,000 pounds. The remainder is located in \nsmaller tanks several hundred feet from the larger tank.\n \n3. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SECNARIO \n \n The scenarios for Glens Falls are taken from the EPA's RMP Guidance for propane storage \nfacilities because the regulated flammable gas stored in Glens Falls is very similar to propane.\n \n The worst case scenario submitted for a level 3 flammable substance involves catastrophic \nrelease from a storage tank. Our scenario is based on a maximum, one tank storage of 48,000 \npounds. Passive mitigation systems have not been considered. It is assumed the entire contents \nare released as a vapor cloud and 10% of the cloud ignites in a vapor cloud explosion. This \nproduces off-site\n consequences of a magnitude of one poun"

      "SummaryText": "d overpressure up to 0.3 miles from the tank.\n \n The alternate release scenario submitted for a level 3 flammable substance involves a spill of \nflammable material, such as from overfilling the storage tank. The scenario assumes release of \n9700 pounds of flammable material which is assumed to produce a pool fire. The guidance \ndocument indicates the maximum distance for people to suffer second degree burns from a 40 \nsecond exposure is 0.1 miles from the center of the pool.\n \n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC \nPREVENTION STEPS\n \n The Glens Falls facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release \nprevention requirements contained in 40CFR part 68. In addition, the Glens Falls foam process is \nsubject to the requirements of 29CFR1910.119. The facility has also submitted a Title V air \npermit application. The elements of the Glens Falls program follow closely those contained in the \nPSM regulation. A brief description follows:\n \n Process Safety Information\n The facility maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes chemical \nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis\n In order to identify and then control the hazards of the process, the Glens Falls facility has \nperformed a What-If, HAZOP analysis using a team of qualified people with expertise in \nengineering, process operations and a leader with hazard analysis expertise. The hazard review is \nupdated at least every 5 years or when major changes are made. The findings are addressed in a \ntimely manner and documented.\n \n Operating Procedures\n To ensure the covered process is operated safely, written operating instructions are developed, \nmaintained, and made readily available to operators. These procedures address various modes of \noperation such as startup, shutdown, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency \nshutdown and emergency operation."

      "SummaryText": "Training\n The Glens Falls facility trains employees that operate the covered processes initially, as changes \nare made and refresher training is conducted at least every three years. Training records are \nmaintained.\n \n Mechanical Integrity\n The Glens Falls maintenance personnel perform documented maintenance on covered process \nequipment to ensure proper operation. A list of critical equipment with required test frequencies \nis maintained. Identified deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner. The work is performed by \ntrained maintenance personnel. Equipment covered includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief \nand vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n \n Management of Change\n Written Management of change procedures are followed, covering changes to process \nchemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Operating and maintenance personnel \naffected by changes made aware of the changes and retrained as needed.\n \n Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n These reviews are conducted for initial startups and those following modifications. The reviews \nconfirm that construction, equipment and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for \na safe startup prior to placing the equipment into operation.\n \n Compliance Audits\n Audits will continue be done to ensure that the provisions of PSM and RPM are being \nimplemented. Any necessary corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n \n Incident Investigation\n Tenneco personnel will promptly investigate any incident that has or could reasonable have \nresulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The investigations seek to identify \ncauses and any corrective actions that may be implemented to prevent recurrences. Reports will \nbe maintained for at least 5 years.\n \n \n Employee Participation\n Tenneco believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. \nEmployees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention"
