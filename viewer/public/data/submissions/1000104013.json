This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes. The Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. Energy Transfer employees are trained to respond to releases in a \"limited\" manner meaning at no time will an employee assume an unreasonable risk to deal with an emergency. Only when safe to do so, trained employees may secure the area; identify the problem; conduct a hazard and risk assessment; perform system shutdowns, isolation and pressure reduction, as deemed necessary; contain and mitigate incidental releases, etc. If an unreasonable risk exists, employees will evacuate from the danger zone and will contact trained emergency responders and 3rd party contractors to assist in controlling and mitigating emergency situations. During such emergencies, employees will assist in an indirect manner and will not assume active response measures within the danger zone.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nEnergy Transfer's operates the Waskom Gas Plant located in Harrison County, Texas. The Waskom Gas Plant is located in a remote area. The Waskom Gas Plant receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants are stored.  The marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas and liquids are temporarily stored onsite.  The largest volume stored in a process is in a 90,000 gallon (380,000 lbs) propane storage tank. \n\nA total rupture of the 90,000 gallon NGL storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Waskom Gas Plant. The 90,000 gallon storage tank has been evaluated for total rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis res"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEnergy Transfer operates Waskom Gas Plant located in Harrison County, Texas. Waskom Gas Plant is a natural gas processing facility. The facility handles LPG, which is comprised of ethane, propane, butanes, and heavier hydrocarbons, from natural gas. As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Waskom Gas Plant is a Program 3 process.\n\nWaskom Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nEnergy Transfer identified one regulated flammable substance (LPG, flammable liquid mixture) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored. It was determined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture exceeded threshold quantity. The identification of this exceedance indicates that Waskom Ga"

Operators are equipped with an Emergency Plan Book that gives the procedures to follow in case of an emergency.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Waskom Gas Plant. Because the facility has processes that are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the required elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEnergy Transfer and the Waskom Gas Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information. Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Waskom Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards. This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility to maintain up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in the safety data"

In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limited maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems. \n\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Waskom Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with various processes are identified and controlled. Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Waskom Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP method to perform these evaluations. This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed. \n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. The Waskom Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule for completion dates. This also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in"
