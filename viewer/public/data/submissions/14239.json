The facility processes fluid milk and posses a large refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is the only chemical to meet the requirements of the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia on site is approximately 11,400 pounds.\n\nReleases are prevented in several ways.  Preventive maintenance assures mechanical integrity through inspection, repair and replacement of system components.  Annual training ensures employee awareness.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown, augmented by manual isolation and shutdown procedures.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios indicate that toxic endpoints may extend to 3000 and 450 yards, respectively.  Off site impacts may be further minimized by implementing emrgency response procedures, which are maintained on site.\n\nNo reportable releases have been recorded at the subject site.  Planned changes to improve safety include improving detection, warning and response procedures."
