Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant to ensure that the quality of the St. Mary\u00bfs River, our City\u00bfs #1 natural resource, is not harmed in any fashion by the discharge from the plant or by it\u00bfs operational techniques.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant depends on the addition of chlorine to lower the final effluent\u00bfs bacterial count to an acceptable level prior to it\u00bfs entry into the St. Mary\u00bfs River.\n\nThe citizens of Sault Ste. Marie depend on the St. Mary\u00bfs River for their livelihoods and their recreation, so it is a goal of the Wastewater Treatment Plant to protect our neighbors from any accidental release of chlorine that is necessary to protect our river\u00bfs high water quality.\n\nThis Executive Summary is submitted in eight segments.  It was created to both satisfy the Section 112r requirements and to assure our citizens of the great care taken in their protection from a release of chlorine that is beneficial to the disinfection of their waste water.\n\nThis Executive Summary was written by the management of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  It summarizes the overall safety programs that all Wastewater Treatment Plant staff created, maintain, update, and train for.  In no way is it intended to provide all the safety measures and programs at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  It is an overview to provide our customers with the chlorine information and to satisfy the risk management plan requirements.\n\nThe staff of the Wastewater Treatment Plant live in the City of Sault Ste.

Strictly followed procedures, extensive training, newly installed chlorine equipment, and excellent preventive maintenance are just some of the tools our staff uses to prevent even the smallest of chlorine leaks from occurring.\n\n6.  5 Year Accident History\n\nThe City of Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant has never had a release of chlorine since the plant was commissioned in 1959.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nOur emergency response to a chlorine leak can be broken down into two parts: small releases that can be stopped and repaired in-house and larger leaks, where it is beyond the capabilities of the Wastewater Treatment Plant staff to deal with alone.\n\nSmall releases are those that chlorine does not leave the Wastewater Treatment Plant\u00bfs grounds.  These type of releases are stopped and repaired by the Wastewater Treatment Plant staff by shutting down the chlorination system and repairing the defective equipment.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant staff has an intimate knowledge of all aspects of our chlorination equipment and receive training in leak repair, chemical safety and Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).\n\nFor larger releases that endanger areas beyond the Wastewater Treatment Plant\u00bfs grounds, the staff shall immediately contact outside help to assist us in controlling the emergency situation.  The outside help is the Chippewa County Office of Emergency Services.  We shall invoke the Emergency Operations Plan for Chippewa County and notify and/or evacuate the effected public and prevent the release from becoming larger.\n\nParticipants of the Chippewa County Emergency Operations Plan are:\n\n1.

      "SummaryText": "tment Facility\n\nThe City of Sault Ste. Marie has approximately 15,000 residents who reside within it\u00bfs 15 square miles.  The City\u00bfs boundaries are the St. Mary\u00bfs River to the East, North, and West.  3 Mile Road is it\u00bfs Southern border.\n\nThe citizens of Sault Ste. Marie have been served by as municipally treated wastewater facility since 1959.  Prior to this, the wastewater was diverted directly to the St. Mary\u00bfs River.  The original plant had primary treatment only, which provided only disinfection with chlorine and settling of solids material.  Ton containers of chlorine were utilized since the beginning of the City\u00bfs wastewater treatment operations.\n \nIn 1985, the City invested millions of dollars to upgrade the existing wastewater treatment plant to provide complete treatment to our sewage.  The current facility involves the following treatment methods: Pre-aeration, bar screening, aerated grit-removal, primary sedimentation, secondary treatment with biological contactors, secondary sedimentation, and chlorination.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant continues to use liquid chlorine for disinfection of it\u00bfs final effluent.  The City of Sault Ste. Marie has used liquid chlorine in ton containers for wastewater disinfection for 45 years.  The management and staff have a combined total of over one and a half centuries of liquid chlorine experience.  We are very knowledgeable in it\u00bfs use and extremely aware of the inherent dangers of it\u00bfs presence.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1171 E. Portage Ave.  The plant is situated on a large tract of land adjacent to the St. Mary\u00bfs River.  It\u00bfs final effluent discharge line is a 30 diameter pipe running out nearly 700 feet into the river.  Approximately 76 miles of sanitary sewers empty into our Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe original chlorine equipment was replaced in 2002 with a new, more modern, and safer system built by Regal Chlorinators.

Vacuum systems actually prevent venting of chlorine leaks by drawing in air to the opening instead of pushing chlorine out as a pressure system would.  The purpose for the change was primarily safety related.  The investment in the new vacuum feed system demonstrates the City of Sault Ste. Marie\u00bfs commitment to utilizing the safest techniques and equipment available to feed chlorine.\n\nOur chlorine is stored in ton containers.  The active ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Room.  The non-active ton containers are stored adjacent to the Chlorine Room on a rail mounted holding system designed specifically for ton containers.  The Chlorine Room is kept locked at all times.  Only authorized Wastewater Treatment Plant employees have access to the Chlorine Room.\n\nThe Chlorine Room has a sensitive alarm system that activates in the event of the most minute chlorine leak.  The maximum inventory capability is eight ton containers, although normal inventory levels are often less than half that amount.\n\nOur chlorination flow pattern begins at our ton containers.  The vacuum regulator/check unit pulls chlorine gas (not liquid) to the chlorinator.  The chlorinator meters, controls, and injects the chlorine gas into a water line forming a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is piped to a contact tank where the disinfection process occurs.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances\n\nOur chlorine supply is the only substance that falls under Section 112r regulations.  Our chlorine is also regulated under OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n \nChlorine is considered a toxic substance and has a characteristic, penetrating, and irritating odor.  The gas is greenish-yellow in color and the liquid is clear amber in color.  Gaseous chlorine is heavier than air and will sink to lower levels in a release.

At chlorine concentrations above 5 parts per million, the gas is very irritating.  At concentrations near the threshold of smell (well below 1 part per million for most people) chlorine gas will, after several hours of exposure, cause mild irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.  In extreme cases of chlorine inhalation, difficulty in breathing can progress to the point of death through suffocation.\n\nLiquid chlorine in contact with eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.\n\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant takes a many-faceted approach to the safe handling of our chlorine and chlorination equipment.  We follow OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals rule to assist us in our use of chlorine.\n\nOur chlorine safety program begins with employee involvement.  All Wastewater Treatment Plant employees have a hand in it\u00bfs formation.  We have bi-monthly safety meetings held on the first and third Wednesdays of each month.  These meetings also cover topics related to chlorine safety, such as lock-out/tag-out, and personal protective equipment.  Employees are encouraged to bring new safety issues to the meetings.\n\nIt is the goal of the Wastewater Treatment Plant management and the City of Sault Ste. Marie to have a well trained workforce who can safely, correctly, and quickly respond to any situation by relying on their previous training and common sense to overcome any hazardous situation that may confront them.  Training is the key to this goal, so all employees receive documented training on all our operating procedures.  No employee can work a shift alone until they become fully trained.\n\nOur operating procedures are annually reviewed by the staff to make sure they reflect any changes made"

All chlorination equipment\u00bfs maintenance requirements are documented and scheduled.  Procedures, in accordance with the equipment\u00bfs manufacturer, were written for all maintenance activities, and qualified personnel only work on our chlorination equipment.  If an employee finds, or suspects a piece of equipment not to be performing up to specifications, it shall be removed from service and a work order made out to notify maintenance personnel of the problem.  All work orders relating to our chlorination equipment receive the highest priority.\n\n \nThe staff performed a Process Hazard Analysis on our chlorination system and all it\u00bfs components and procedures.  We used the \u00bfWhat If\u00bf method and wrote numerous \u00bfWhat If\u00bf scenarios.  We answered the scenarios as a group and now include them in our operating procedures and our contingency plan.\n\nIn short, Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant employees are trained in Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analysis, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, standard safety practices, and safe work practices on a continuing basis to guard against the possibility of a chlorine release.  In the unlikely event of a chlorine release, the staff is trained in stopping and repairing the release and to know when to call in outside help.\n\n4.  Worst Case Scenario\n\nOur worst case scenario for chlorine release is the complete release of a full ton container in 10 minutes, which represents a release rate of 200 lbs per minute.\n\nThe model used for our worst case is the \u00bfEPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\u00bf reference tables and equations.  The conditions in the worst case scenario are a class F atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity at 25 degrees C. with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  The height"

Even though we have a relatively low population in the surrounding area of the Wastewater Treatment Plant, we selected an \u00bfurban\u00bf topography as directed in the RMP Submit instructions because of the surrounding buildings that represent obstructions.\n\nThe endpoint of our worst case scenario is 1.3 miles.  Offsite consequences from the worst case include an effected population of 2,500 people.  Within the 1.3 mile radius is residential housing and numerous recreation areas owned by the City of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThe worst case scenario is highly unlikely due to the fact that it requires liquid chlorine to escape from the container.  We only use chlorine in the gaseous form.  To get the volume of release calculated in the worst case scenario, a ton container would have to vent chlorine through an opening in the thick, steel container wall, which is very unlikely, or by breaking off the lower valve or fusible plug below the liquid line of the container.  Due to the staff\u00bfs extreme care and extensive training in the handling of the ton containers, this is also highly unlikely.\n\n5.  Alternate Chlorine Release Scenario\n\nOur alternate release scenario is designed to represent the most likely type of chlorine release.  It estimates the loss of gaseous chlorine if a 1/4 line was broken and it released gaseous chlorine at a rate of 9# per minute for 10 minutes.  It also represents weather conditions that are more frequent at the Wastewater Treatment Plant: a 3 meter per second wind speed with a class D atmospheric stability.  We also chose a \u00bfrural\u00bf topography for our alternate release, because there are relatively few obstructions within the immediate surrounding area of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  All other data is the same as in the worst case scenario.\n\n \nThe endpoint for our alternate release scenario is 0.2 miles.  A 0.2 mile radius contains a population of 130 people.  The alternate release scenario model is from the \u00bfEPA\u00bfs RMP"
