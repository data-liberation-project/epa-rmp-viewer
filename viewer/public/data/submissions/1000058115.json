      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  Cargill Meat Solution's chemical accident prevention and emergency response policies for ammonia refrigeration involve the development of this Risk Management Program and Plan (RMP) which has a primary objective of preventing an accidental release of ammonia, and minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur.  Senior management has appointed a Safety Manager to monitor and maintain overall compliance with both OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:  Cargill Meat Solutions, Corporation (Cargill) is a poultry processing facility located in Albert Lea, Minnesota.  The facility has two closed-loop systems (the Frigo and Main systems) which use pressurized liquid and vapor anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration and freezing of meat products throughout the plant.  Each system consists of an outdoor receiver vessel, a network of indoor and rooftop piping, and various small holding units (compressors, pumps, chillers, condensers, etc.).  For simplicity, both systems and their combined anhydrous ammonia quantity are considered one single covered process in this document.  Total quantity is estimated at approximately 37,000# combining all piping and vessels together.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The prevention program for Cargill includes employee training, contractor evaluation and training, regular maintenance, and communication with local emergency responders.   Cargill considers accidental release prevention when changes are made to any covered process, when contractors are used onsite, or when changes in procedures take place. \r\nThe following elements are required for a program 3 prevention program.\r\nA\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\nA\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nA\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\nA\u00bf\tTraining\r\nA\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\nA\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\nA\u00bf\tCompliance Audit\r\nA\u00bf\tManagement of Cha"

The Risk Management Program will be updated periodically and changes will be recorded.  Changes to activities and covered process will be communicated with affected employees, contractors used on site, and local emergency responders.\r\nFinally, Cargill has numerous written procedures for operating the anhydrous ammonia system and refilling various holding vessels.  These act as administrative controls by limiting the quantity contained in each part of the system and preventing overfilling or accidental releases.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:  In the previous five years, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:  This facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Albert Lea Joint Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). However, Cargill provides annual training to its employees for responding to accidental material releases, and thus does not rely on the LEPC for primary emergency response.  This training was last updated in Augustof 2015.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  The most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) was performed on July 31st, 2016.  The last Management of Change review was conducted in October of 2010.  The facility continues to monitor and maintain its PSM/RMP program through an organized PSM team chartered to ensure all elements of the PSM/RMP program are in place.  The last review of the facility Emergency Response Plan took place on February 23rd, 2016."
