This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as\nrequired by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of\nthe current Risk Management Program and to describe further\nmeasures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of\nRS's.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region's Wastewater Treatment Plant,\nlocated at 2880 S. Fifth Ave., Oroville, CA in Butte County, uses\nchlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the\nFederal threshold quantity for this RS. The facility is located\nin an industrial area in Oroville. There are 8 full-time\nemployees at this site. Chlorine is received in ton containers by\ntruck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton\ncontainer scales inside the building. The chlorine is used for\nodor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the\nwastewater effluent, and for other process uses. Pressu"

The alternative case considered for this\nfacility is the release of chlorine from a pinhole in one of the\nfusible plugs on a received ton container, due to a supplier\nerror or damage in transit, with the release secured by\napplication of a Type B Ton Container Repair Kit fixture after\n60 minutes.\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Sewerage Commission Oroville\nRegion which were considered to mitigate the severity of the\nWorst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region's written policies and\nprocedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel,\nwritten procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at\nthe facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement\nmaterials and components for the chlorine systems.\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of\nthe Worst Case scenario.
