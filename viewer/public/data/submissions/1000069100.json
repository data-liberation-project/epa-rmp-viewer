This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN:  The Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. The Mountain View Fire Department would be the HAZMAT responder.  The local fire department is included in our notification procedures and emergency action plan.  Aurora Organic Dairy personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in actual response if it required Level A suits.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The facility was built new in 2004.  There have been two major additions to the ammonia refrigeration system since the original construction.  The latest was the addition of a 110 foot\u0081]high hi\u0081-rise automatic storage and retrieval cold storage facility. \r\n \r\nThere have been no release events or incidents since the facility was built in 2004."

      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  The stationary source is defined as Aurora Organic Dairy facility is located at 6788 State Highway 66, Platteville, CO.  Aurora Organic Dairy processes & distributes organic milk and dairy products from milk produced on our own organic dairy farms located in Colorado and Texas. The facility is a state\u0081 of\u0081 the\u0081 art 100% organic milk plant.  The facility has one refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664\u0081-41-\u00817. Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility. The Ammonia Refrigeration System contains approximately 13,750 pounds of ammonia. The facility exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. \r\n \r\nAnyone interested can visit our website and see photos of our facility:  www.auroraorganic.com\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION:  Releases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated component shutdowns in case safe parameters would be exceeded. Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS:  Computer air models were developed based on a worstcase release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system's largest recirculator vessels. By EPA definition, the worst\u0081 case scenario is considered to be the total capacity of ammonia in the largest vessel in the system which is this recirculator vessel.  This vessel normally operates with an inventory of approximately 6,000 pounds; however, if necessary in a pump\u0081-down situation it could hold approximately 13,000 pounds.  The worst\u0081]case and alternate\u0081-case models were produced using Marplot. The toxic endpoin"
