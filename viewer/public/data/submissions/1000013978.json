      "SummaryText": "Mason Metals Corporation was founded in 1949.   In the mid-1970s, the company expanded its business into the production of Stannic and Stannous Chloride.   In both of these production processes, elemental chlorine is utilized as a raw material.\n\nDue to the need to expand the processing of Stannic and Stannous Chloride, the company has the potential to increase the amount of chlorine that is required in it's production processes.   This RMP filing will accomodate the addition of a second chlorine vaporizer which would draw product from a second source, increasing the containers that would be connected to the process above the 2,500lb threshold reporting level for Chlorine.\n\nThe facility has gone through major renovation with a new management team approximately 2 years ago.  It has become the premier supplier of tin containing compounds in North America.  It also continues it's role as the solution provider for the handling and reprocessing of tin containing concentrates from various industries, as a viable option to disposal.\n\nMason Corporation products are relied upon for the production of a variety of industrial, specialty and FCC products thar are utilized by major chemical and pharmaceutical companies throughout the world."
