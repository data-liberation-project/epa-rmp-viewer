The plan concentrates on chemical release emergencies and specifies emergency response procedures to be followed by City of Sulphur Springs employees. These activities include recognition of the emergency, responding in a defensive manner in the protection of life and property, limited control, containment, and confinement activities; and facility evacuation. OSHA HAZWOPER requirements for achieving this capability are detailed. The plan is constructed generally around the requirements given in 29 CFR 1910.120. it is intended primarily for use in connection with a chlorine release, since that is the facility's most sensitive chemical from both safety and environmental points of vew. This plan is intended for use in conjunction with the Facilities Emergency Action Plan covering evacuation procedures. The Emergency Response Plan is backed up by and is a suppliment to Annex Q of the City of Sulphur Spring Emergency Management Plan.\n\nThe facility manager is directly responsible for coordinating the efforts involving this Emergency Response Plan. The facility manager is closely involved with the activities which bear on the facility's interface with the public and Fire and Emergency Management responders as well. The City Manager has overall accountability for the program. The facility manager and shift supervisors are responsible for directing the activities of the employees involved in emergency responses.\n\nIt is not the intent of the Waste Water Facility to maintain a complete hazardous material emergency response team. Activities of facility employees are limited to the cap"

This level of training permits the employee to respond at the site of emergency only under conditions permitting activities within their levels of expertise gained through the training described below. In the event of the use of the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and Office of Emergency Management, employee assistance in the emergency response will be under the guidance of the on-site incident Commander, which in our case means only along with outside responding entry teams, and only if the assistance can be given within parameters set for the training level achieved by facility employees.\n\nThe facility maintains coordination with the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize them with the potential emergencies which might occur. The Waste Water Treatment Facility has assembled and maintains appropriate materials in the form of manufacturers' literature, handbooks, pictures, drawings, etc. to demonstrate clearly the layout of the facility's potential trouble areas and the equipment which the Sulphur Springs Fire Department may need to work with to alleviate an emergency situation. This material will be used by facility personnel, in a safe area prior to entry into the emergency site, to assist the Sulphur Springs Fire Department in their activities, and to show the outside responders what they need to do to mitigate any potential emergency situation.\n\nPeriodic tours are offered to the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize their personnel with our facility.\n\nIn any emergency situation, the facility manager will be in overall charge of the facility employees and their activities. In the facility manger's absence, the shift supervisor will be in charge. T"

      "SummaryText": "he Sulphur Springs Fire Department or Office of Emergency Mangement will be in charge of actual response activities.\n\nTHE CITY OF SULPHUR SPRINGS WASTE WATER FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary activity of the City of Sulphur Springs Waste Water Facility is the treatment of the municipal waste water. The primary regulated products are chlorine and sulfur dixoide.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe chlorine worst-case release scenario is based on a ten minute release of a 2000 pound cylinder. The offsite impact could be up to 3.0 miles from the Waste Water Facility. The number of citizens who might be affected by such a release would depend on the wind speed, direction, and other atmospheric conditions at the time of the release. In the entire 3.0 mile radius around the facility the approximate residential population is 7,072 citizens. \n\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario is based on a 200 pound pipe leak release of chlorine which would affect only a radius of 0.20 miles around the facility. This area has no residential population. This type of leak can be mitigated by trained plant employees with minimal exposure.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide worst-case release scenario is based on a ten minute release of 2000 pound cylinder. The offsite impact could be up to 2.1 miles from the Waste Water Facility. The number of citizens who might be affected by such a release would depend on the wind speed, direction, and other atmospheric conditions at the time of the release. In the entire 2.1 mile radius around the facility the approximate residential population is 3,166 citizens. \n\nThe sulfur dioxide altermative release scenario is based on a 200 pound pipe leak release of sulphur dioxide which would affect only a radius of 0.20 miles around the facility. This area has no residential population. This type of leak can be mitigated by trained plant employees with minimal exposure.\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PRE"

Mock disaster training is held periodically. After every training scenario, or release, whether minor in scale or large enough to require outside assistance, a critique will be conducted to determine areas of the procedures needing improvement. This critique will be conducted by facility manager and will include input from any of the responding agencies involved. The facility manager will consider the outcome of the critique and incorporate any needed changes to this plan and the operating procedures."
