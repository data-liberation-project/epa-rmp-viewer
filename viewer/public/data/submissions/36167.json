(Heyco) located at 1069 Stinson Drive in Reading, Pennsylvania operates a rolling and slitting process for copper and brass coils that are annealed in furnaces at the facility.  The facility is located in Bern Township, Berks County, PA.  Facility boundaries include other industrial facilities to the southwest, open hilly areas to the northwest and northeast, and open land to the southeast.\n\nThe facility receives anhydrous ammonia by tank truck and stores it in an 8,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia storage tank at Heyco is filled to 85% of capacity.  At this level the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank is 35,200 pounds (6,800 gallons).  The anhydrous ammonia is catalytically converted to its basic components, nitrogen and hydrogen.  This dissociated ammonia is used to control the atmosphere in the annealing furnaces.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Risk Management Program Rule with a 10,000-pound threshold.\n\nThe process with respect to RMP regulations begins with the unloading of anhydrous ammonia into the storage tank and continues to the outlet of the dissociators at which point the ammonia has been converted to hydrogen and nitrogen.\n\nHeyco maintains a detailed emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and EPCRA Emergency Planning requirements for ammonia.  The Facilities Manager serves as facility coordinator for implementation of the emergency action plan. For ammonia releases inside the facility, employees are trained to evacuate and 911 is called for emergency help.  The plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nHeyco has taken precautions to ensure that the potential for an incident involving ammonia is minimal.  The RMP program includes the following additional sections that are in practice at the facility.\n\n\u00b7Management System\n\u00b7Employee Participation\n\u00b7Process Safety Information\n\u00b7Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00b7Operating Procedures\n\u00b7Training\n\u00b7Contractors\n\u00b7Pre-startup Safety Revie"
