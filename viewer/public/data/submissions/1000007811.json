      "SummaryText": "Berkeley Farms, LLC processes milk products.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures, but is handled as a gas liquified under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporative condensers, compressors, process air handlers, glycol chillers, low pressure receiver, pumps, piping, and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Berkeley Farms, LLC is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA' Process Safety Management Standard(PSM), Title 29 Code of Fedral Regulations (CFR)1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP),  Title 40CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releaqses of Ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario: EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\"(November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program Berkeley Farms, I"

Has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.\nThese programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigations\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permits\nContractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As part of the PSM program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 which will notify the Hayward Fire Department.  In addition, the Hayward Fire Department has included Berkeley Farms, LLC in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-Year Accident History: Berkeley Farms, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety:  Several Developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Revised Standard Operating Procedures, updated Emergency Response Plan, and a renewed emphasis on training are some of the major steps taken to improve safety. Changes in our program have been implemented by Berkeley Farms, LLC.\n\nIn addition, the facility will seek to operate and maintain our refrigeration system in accordance wit IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
