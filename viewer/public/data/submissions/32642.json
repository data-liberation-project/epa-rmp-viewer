This plan has been endorsed by the officials at the highest level of the Sanitation District No. 1.  The Dry Creek WWTP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak.  \n\n?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Dry Creek WWTP Chlorination Facility.  The Dry Creek WWTP chlorination facility is divided into two separate rooms:  the Storage Room and the Chlorinator Room.  The storage room houses three banks of three one-ton containers.  The containers store chlorine as a pressurized liquid and feed liquid chlorine to the evaporators.  A single one-ton container remains on-line at all times while the remaining containers are on stand-by for changeover when the contents of the on-line container are exhausted.\n\nDry Creek WWTP is equipped with chlorine leak detectors to notify the plant in the event of a chlorine release.  An audible alarm automatically sounds inside and outside the building when chlorine levels reach 0.5 part per million (ppm).  The chlorine is fed as a gas from the chlorinators to the injectors.  Feeding the chlorine as a gas under vacuum reduces the likelihood of a release into the environment.  \n\n?68.155(c ) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPrevention Program 3 elements are presented in the Process Safety Management Plan for the Dry Creek WWTP.  The Prevention Program required under 40 CFR Part 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA PSM.  Required elements include:\n\nEmployee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work "

      "SummaryText": "Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits\n\n?68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Dry Creek WWTP has had no documented accidents, as described under 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), related to the chlorination facility that have occurred in the last five years.\n\n?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Dry Creek WWTP has deveoped an Emergency Response Program in accordance with 40 CFR 68.95.  This program covers the following elements:\n\n?Public and emergency response agency notification procedures;\n?Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment;\n?Emergency response measures;\n?Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining response equipment; \n?Employee training; and\n?Program review procedures.\n\nThis program outlines the actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The facility has coordinated this plan with the Greater Cincinnati HAZMAT Response Team. The facility is included in the written community response plan and has performed drills with the local response agencies.\n\n?68.155(f) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) on June 11, 1997.  Recommendations were identified for three main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Maintenance, and Training.  According to the PSM, safety improvements will be evaluated for their impacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  The PHA was reviewed and revalidated in 2002.  Resolutions or follow-up to the initial PHA recommendations have been documented.  Additional recommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the PHA is updated every five years."
