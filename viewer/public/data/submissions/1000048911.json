      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW\r\nThe Western Refining Wingate Facility (Western Wingate), previously Wingate Fractionation plant owned by ConocoPhillips, was acquired by Western Refining Company in October 2014. Prior to the ownership change, ConocoPhillips shut down the fractionation plant, de-inventorized the entire site, and purged all chemicals covered under the RMP rule.  All records related to the RMP rule prior to the ownership transition are maintained by ConocoPhillips.  Since October 2014, the only active process at Western Wingate covered under the RMP rule is the butane storage vessels and the loading and unloading activities.  This RMP renewal is submitted by Western Wingate for the butane storage process under its ownership since October 1, 2014.  Should any processes become active in the future, Western Wingate will submit new updates to the USEPA to comply with the RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nThis RMP includes all of the elements required by 40 CFR 68. It is composed of the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, the emergency response plan, an analysis and evaluation of offsite consequences, and other related environmental and health and safety documents and programs.  This executive summary presents an overview of the plan and describes briefly the key elements of the RMP.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nWestern Wingate is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nWingate is located about 5 miles east of Gallup, New Mexico, north of Interstate 40.  Currently, the facility's primary activity is as a bulk liquefied petroleum gas storage termina"

Currently there is only one (1) RMP-regulated substance; butane, present at or above threshold quantities at the facility.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nWestern Wingate has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with API Standards and NFPA codes.  The facility is subjected to the Program Level 3 prevention program under the RMP rule.  It complies with the OSHA PSM Standard.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWestern Wingate maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs for the current RMP covered process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval required by the OSAH PSM Standard and EPA RMP rule.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Wingate maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nWestern Wingate has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Process equipment examined during these checks includes, among other things, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Inspection and maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by these checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are available to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Wingate. These reviews are conducted to confirm, prior to placing equipment into operation, that construction and equipment as well as operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nWestern Wingate will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three years, and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nWestern Wingate promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nWestern truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of the past safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Western Wingate has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and all processes around which the contractor will be working. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention activities, Western has safety features on active process units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. \r\n\r\nThe following types of safety features are used at Wingate:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection with Alarms\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n-Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n-Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n-Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\r\n-Pres"

This coordination includes participating local periodic LEPC meetings, review incident response plans, and facilitate communications and planning.
