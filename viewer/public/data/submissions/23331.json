Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Keota)\n     are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with\n     the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of\n     the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct\n     application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n     Anhydrous ammoia and propane are stored at the facility in four storage tanks 11,000 \n     gallons and 26,000 gallons for ammonia; 30,000 gallons and 11,800 gallons for propane.\n     The maximum quanitiy stored would be 157,250 pounds for ammonia and 131,461 \n     pounds for propane.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenerio.\n\n     a.     The worst case scenerio for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total\n             contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of ten minutes.  The \n             maximum quantity released would be 157,250 pounds, which represents the volume\n             of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The\n             distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.\n             For propane the maximum quantity released would be 132,000 pounds.  The distance\n             to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.4 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenerio for anhydrous ammonia is a release from a break in a\n             3-inch"

The maximum quantity released would be 110,500\n             pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of pispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n             The alternate release scenerio for propane is a release from a hose rupture caused\n             by a pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The acive\n             mitigation devices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the\n             contents of the hose.  The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds.  The\n             distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.4 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety\n     Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published\n     by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S.\n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\n     Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference\n     by Iowa Administration Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)- Standard for the Storage\n     and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.\n     The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past\n     five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the    \n     facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,\n     sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.     a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 19"

Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are \n     performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional\n     specific recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane\n     for implementation at this time."
