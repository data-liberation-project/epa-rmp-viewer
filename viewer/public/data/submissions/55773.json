      "SummaryText": "Richelieu Foods, Inc., Beaver Dam, WI is a production facility for pizza's.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system for product cooling, freezing and control of production room temperatures.  This facility has recently added ammonia which brought it over the 10,000 threshold.  A PSM program has been developed and is on file.  US-OSHA recently visited this facility and reviewed portions of the PSM program.  Employees are informed there is ammonia on the facility and that a PSM program exists. There are two separate engine rooms, each  operating two-stage ammonia compressors, both of which are linked together. This facility uses outside ammonia refrigeration contractors for contruction and servicing of its equipment. In-house personnel conduct and document PM's and testing through a CMMS program.  The review of Richelieu Food's accident history includes the range of dates: June 25, 2004 to June 25, 2009.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there has been no accidental release at this facility. For emergencies, the facility Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provides for implementing an emergency response.  The response is coordinated with the local Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for assistance. Individuals, at this facility that are involved with an emergency response, are trained on a yearly basis."
