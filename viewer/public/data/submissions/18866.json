The terminal functions as a storage and distribution facility for the fertilizer used by Farmlands 600,000 producer-members to grow crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 20,000 tons of ammonia is distributed through this facility, which has been supplying co-ops in the south central and southwestern Minnesota and eastern South Dakota for 22 years.  As a terminal, the Murdock facility provides a vital link in the chain of Farmland agricultural inputs.  Anhydrous Ammonia is shipped to the Murdock terminal where it is stored until needed by local co-ops for their patrons fields. By eliminating much of the shipping costs for the co-ops, the terminal helps contain the cost of fertilizer for Farmland member-owners as well as provide a convenient location for them to get their product.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nFarmland is a solid, reliable member of the Murdock community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service member-owners as needed throughout the year.  Farmland's Murdock employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to \"always be there if someone needs us.\"\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nFarmland employs three full-time people with 33 years of combined operating experience at its Murdock terminal.  Although few in number, employees have a large impact on the community in which they live.

This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPAs RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of terminal activities.\n\nThe Murdock terminal adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements including routine training and testing of employees and drivers that operate any part of the process, alarms to indicate operating conditions outside the norm, an off-hours phone notification system for abnormal conditions, video monitoring of truck loading/unloading stations and automatic shutdown of ammonia transfer should control parameters fall outside normal conditions.  Additionally, the facility is equipped with terminal perimeter sensors to monitor potential emissions from the facility, continuously.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in these programs throughout its years of operation.\n\nThe facility is diligent in adhering to and maintaining its Process Safety/Prevention Program.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Murdock Ammonia Terminal has established an Emergency Response Program and has a written Emergency Response Plan as required by the Risk Management Program rule and other Environmental Protection Agency and OSHA rules.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone.\" Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is "

      "SummaryText": "more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminals 90,000-gallon bullet, administratively controlled to 85% of its volume.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank, in 10 minutes.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and sto"

Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is, a release of ammonia due to the failure of rail car unloading hoses connected for unloading into the Bullet Tank.  The hoses are assumed to fail due to rail car movement and release ammonia for a few seconds before an excess flow valve stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program. A formal process hazard analysis revalidation is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
