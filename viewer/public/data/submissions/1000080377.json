The processed products and cold storage of those products require refrigeration. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There are two Machinery Rooms located at the facility.\n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp(TM) was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years; however, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, lists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished. Monthly Safety meetings and training is conducted for all employees at this facility; in addition, PSM meetings are held to review safety and PSM p"
