Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \n\n     5.

Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n     7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Philadelphia Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \n\n     8.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an our attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pe"

Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe continually strive to make the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  The facility\u00bfs focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, with proactive management of these issues.  For example, we revalidate the Process Hazard Analyses for approximately six (6) process units each year.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had three accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. These accidents are deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in onsite personnel injuries that required medical treatment, resulted in significant property damage onsite or resulted in property damage offsite.  No offsite injuries occurred due to these incidents. For each of these incidents, we have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the events and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The following is a brief summary of these incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn April 4, 2003, while removing a blind from a feed line (which was thought to be empty) to a propane bullet, a mechanic experienced a burn to his thigh when liquid propane was discharged.  The incident investigation showed the cause of the release was a leaking inlet valve that had leaked propane downstream of the valve to the area of the blind.   After this incident, all leaking inlet valves to the propane bullets were replaced and a new valve was installed to give the option to safely isolate the feed lines to the propane bullets in the future.  Also, investigation results, as well as safe work practices when working on jobs with multiple lines, were reviewed with operations and maintenance personnel.\n\nOn January 18, 2003, low fuel gas pressure caused the flame in a heater to blow out.  Unignited fuel gas (consisting of mostly methane) was introduced into the heater, resulting in an explosion that led to a release of gas oil and subseq"

The incident investigation revealed the fuel gas controller was poorly winterized, no operating procedures existed to address the specific situation encountered, and that refinery safety standards had not been followed.  Following the investigation, all refinery operating procedures were reviewed to ensure that all units with heaters had emergency procedures to cover this situation, all emergency shutoff valve bypasses were car sealed closed (per company safety standards), and a standard winterization checklist was developed for all operating areas (which included likely and repetitive freeze up sites).\n\nOn January 25, 2005, a fire occurred when liquid froze in an out of service pipe, causing the pipe to fail and release a mixture of light hydrocarbons under high pressure.  The ensuing vapor cloud was ignited by a nearby heater, which caused a fire in the area of process heat exchangers.  No employees or contractors were injured during the event.  The incident investigation revealed that the out of service pipe was never adequately reviewed at the time it was take out of service to ensure that it had adequate freeze protection.  Following the investigation, a widespread initiative was created to identify and mitigate or remove all out of service piping.\n\nOn March 20, 2007, a propylene release occurred during loading operations.   The vapor release occurred for approximately 3 seconds when the hose disconnected from the truck during loading operations.  Conduit and supports adjacent to the loading rack were damaged, apparently by significant force as the hose swung away from the truck. Although no ignition occurred during this event, a third party contract truck driver was treated at the hospital for 1st degree cold burns. \n\n\nD.
