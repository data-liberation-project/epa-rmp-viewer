Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n     We at Farmers Cooperative Company in Hinton are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Hinton Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n     Our facility\u00bfs primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in 26,000 and 11,800 gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Hinton.  The maximum amount stored is 166,000 pounds at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n     We utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n     The worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the interconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, (166,000 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography; the maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 2.87 miles.  The estimated population within a 2.87-mile radius of this facility is 3,500.\n\n     The alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The scen"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.46 miles.  The estimated population within a 0.42-mile radius of the facility is 550.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n     Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA\u00bfs accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.  \n\n     Process Safety Information: Farmers Cooperative Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix D).\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     Operating Procedures:  Farmers Cooperative Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\n     Training:  Farmers Cooperative Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n     Mechanical Integrity:  Farmers Cooperative Company conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks includ"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\n     Management of Change:  Written procedures are in place at Farmers Cooperative Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\n     Pre-startup Reviews:  Farmers Cooperative Company routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n     Compliance Audits:  Farmers Cooperative Company conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan\u00bfs provisions, set our under the 40 CFR Part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\n     Employee Participation:  Farmers Cooperative Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History:  \n     Farmers Cooperative Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6.  Emergenc"
