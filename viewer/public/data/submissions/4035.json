This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The Risk Management Plan certifies that Cargill Corn Milling Division has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Wahpeton, North Dakota facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA RMP requirements. \n\nThe Risk Management Plan follows the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs, the Risk Management Plan identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios and the facility's five year accidental release history.  The Risk Management Plan also verifies that prevention, mitigation, and emergency response plans are appropriately designed to minimize risks to workers and the potentially affected public.   RMP Data Elements are included as part of this Risk Management Plan.\n\n1.1 Corporate Statement\n\nCargill's policy is to conduct all business activities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and the public.\n\nEnvironment.  Cargill will comply with all applicable laws and regulations; promote waste reduction, resource and property conservation and environmental protection; and train employees to be knowledgeable about all environmental matters relevant to their work.\n\nHealth and Safety.

'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. \n\nAt the Cargill Corn Milling facility at Wahpeton, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is 'rural'.  In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Cargill has elected to model the release assuming a rural surface roughness.  A rural surface roughness value of 10 cm, which is consistent with the land use surrounding the facility, was utilized in the DEGADIS model.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Fargo, ND indicates that these dispersion conditions occur less than 5% of the time (or about 1.2 hours per day, on average).  The most predominant directions of transport are to the north, northwest, and southeast. \n\nThe toxic endpoint for SO2 is 0.0078 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the worst-case SO2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility are subject to Program 3 requirements. \n\n3.1.1 Worst-Case Release: Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Wahpeton facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 228,000 lbs of stored SO2, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  The modeling results showed that the worst-case SO2 release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of 11 miles"

      "SummaryText": ". \n\nThe worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 15,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Wahpeton area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).  The potential worst-case hazard zone includes hospitals, schools, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. Several environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) are also located within the worst-case impact zone.  The closest environmental receptor is the Fort Abercrombie State Park.  \n\nCargill notes that it is impossible to release 228,000 lbs of SO2 in 10 minutes because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid SO2 would not be available.  If the storage tank were to breach, liquid SO2 would spill to the ground in a boiling pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  However, Cargill evaluated this 10 minute release to comply with the noted regulation.\n\n3.2 Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors. In accordance with the EPA's OCAG, a single alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated substance. \n\nCargill performed a thorough rev"

Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Cargill has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for each regulated substance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Fargo, ND, confirmed that conditions of D stability and windspeeds of 3 m/sec and greater are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG).  As with the worst-case scenarios, only the modeling results based on 'rural' surface conditions are included in the Risk Management Plan, in order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates.  However, it should be noted that, under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces at the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint. This is especially true for alternative releases, where distances to toxic endpoints are typically less than the worst-case.  For co"

The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees, and visitors is controlled by fencing and security checkpoints.  Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is the only chemical utilized in the corn milling process at the Wahpeton facility that is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  The Wet Mill Department stores and maintains sulfur dioxide at or above the regulated threshold amounts.  The sulfur dioxide process in the Wet Mill is subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.  \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.

      "SummaryText": "ment Plan.\n\n2.1 Wet Mill Department\n\nThe corn milling process at the Cargill Wahpeton facility is designed to extract useable starch and sugars from corn kernels in order to produce various end-products. The first step in the corn milling process involves steeping the corn kernels in water tanks, into which vaporized SO2 is injected. The SO2 and water form a dilute solution of sulfurous acid that helps to soften the kernel, breakdown proteins and remove soluble constituents. The steeped corn then travels through degerminating mills and separation processes designed to remove the germ and separate out the starch.  The starch slurry is then rinsed in water into which additional vaporized SO2 is injected.  During the primary separation process (starch/gluten) SO2 is also added.  This starch slurry is utilized in the production of high fructose corn syrup.\n\nThe Wet Mill Department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is utilized in the corn milling process.  The SO2 is stored in an exterior storage tank as a pure liquefied gas at ambient temperatures.  The nominal capacity of the storage tank is 295,263 lbs of SO2.  However, by the use of interlocks the maximum amount that can be stored in the SO2 storage tank, at any given time, is 228,000 lbs.  The storage tank is filled approximately once every 3 to 4 weeks via 90-ton railcar.  Access to the loading area is limited by chain link fence and secured by locks.  \n\n\n\n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even e"

For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-cases defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Cargill to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case, and alternative cases, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For materials such as SO2 stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic endpoints, is considered the worst-case release for each facility. Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established toxic endpoints for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\nthe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimate"

Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG) lists a number of refined dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  Sulfur dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than the ambient air.   Therefore, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such cases, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  The Dense Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1) was developed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to model dense gas releases and its use has been approved by the U.S. EPA.  The model is used to predict the dispersion of dense gases from ground level releases over flat, level terrain.  For these reasons, DEGADIS was used to model the worst-case SO2 release.\n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG provides a basic approach to estimating endpoint distances based on an ambient air temperature of 770F.  However, the RMP rule requires that if dispersion techniques other than the OCAG are applied, the maximum daily temperature over the last three years be used.  A review of National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) climatological data for the National Weather Service reporting station at Fargo, ND, indicated a recorded high temperature over the last three years of 940F.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of"

A break of this type would result in a hole in the unloading assembly of approximately 1.0 inch in diameter.  The pressurized release of SO2 through hole of this size would result in two-phase flow (vapor and liquid) as the pressurized SO2 flashed to the vapor state.  The modeling showed that SO2 would be released at a rate of 1600 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the sulfur dioxide would then be dispersed as a heavy gas. Cargill has estimated that it would take a HAZMAT team approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of SO2, resulting in a total release of 48000 lbs.  This alternative SO2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the worst-case.  \n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG indicates that under 'rural' conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 1.9 miles.  Under 'urban' conditions, the distance would be approximately 0.6 miles.  The hazard impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 50 persons, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated in conjunction with EPA's Landview III database program.  Public receptors in the alternative impact zone include industrial/commercial areas.  No environmental receptors would be affected.\n\n\n4.0  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\nSome processes subject to the Risk Management Regulation are also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).

These procedures define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying the appropriate emergency response staff of potential emergency events. If a chemical release is detected on-site, the emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of response is determined by the Incident Commander, with support from available emergency response (HAZ-MAT) teams and technical advisory staff.  Each Department in the facility must also follow a specific Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control Plan in the event of a chemical release. \n\nPlant operations at the Wahpeton facility can present various types of potential hazards and Cargill recognizes the need to have a well trained and prepared work force to safely and effectively deal with any emergency situation.  The Cargill Wahpeton facility provides training of responsible staff and the exercise of important communication links with the community, in order to maintain an appropriate state of readiness for emergency situations.  Cargill Wahpeton plant staff attend periodic meetings with local industry and emergency response planning officials and have participated in emergency response training exercises.  Cargill teams have a First Response capability and are able to administer basic first aid and CPR.
