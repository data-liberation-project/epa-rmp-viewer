      "SummaryText": "The Griswold Water Purification Facility (WPF) was originally constructed in 1965 as the Leonard R. Kuiper WTP. The facility has undergone two major construction projects for capacity expansion and facility improvements. During 1999 through 2001, the Griswold WTP underwent a major rehabilitation, which included significant improvements to the chlorine system.  In 2013, there were more improvements made to the chlorine system.  \n\nThe Griswold Water Treatment Plant's original Risk Management Plan included both chlorine and aqueous ammonia.  Based on the EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance Chapter 1: General Applicability, the aqua ammonia inventory maintained at the Griswold WPF does not meet the threshold quantity that requires it to be listed under the RMP.  The facility does not store at or above the threshold limit of 20,000 pounds for aqueous ammonia; therefore, it was removed from the 2014 submittal leaving chlorine as the only chemical covered in this plan. \n\nChlorine safety is integral to Aurora Water and the staff at the Griswold WPF.  Safeguards on the system include air monitoring, emergency scrubber system, ton container auto closers, pressure and temperature monitors, video observation, restricted access entrances, and multiple daily checks by the operations staff.  \nGriswold has had no chlorine accidents in the past 5 years. The accident free status of the past 5 years and the prior year's reflect Griswold's commitment to safety.\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 68, Sections 48 through 60 (40 CFR Part 68.48 through 68.60) Subpart C, under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the facility has established a Program 2 Prevention Program as a part of the Risk Management Program and Plan. The overall goal of the risk management program and plan are to reduce the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death from accidental release of chemicals.  \n\nRequirements for the Program 2 Prevention Pro"
