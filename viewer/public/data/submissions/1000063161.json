The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority Water Treatment Plant has one (1) regulated substance at the facility above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the water treatment process.  The Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, indentified as \"worst case release\"  and \"alternative scenario\".  The worst case release scenario is defined by EPA as a release of the largest storage vessel over a ten (10) minute period due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release is defined bt EPA as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case release.  The Edgefied County Water & Sewer Authority chose RMP Comp to perform the air dispersion consequence modeling due to the nature of the chemical and the release scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION "

      "SummaryText": "AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Edgefield County Water & sewer Authority has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidential release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance.  The following steps are keyed to the prevention program:\n\n1.  Detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards of chlorine,  process technology, and process equipment.\n\n2.  Comprehensive process hazard analysis is conducted to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluated.\n\n3.  Operating procedures have been developed and implemented which describe tasks to be preformed,  dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, emergency operating procedures and safety and health precautions to be taken.\n\n4.  An employee training program is in effect to ensure that the employees of the Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's Water Treatment Plant are properly trained and aware of all safety practices, hazards, emergency procedures and maintenance procedures.\n\n5.  An on-going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure safe process operation.\n\n6.  Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that all unplanned events affecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely manner to identify the causes of the incident and to implement corrective action.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's Water Treatment Plant has an excellent record of preventing accidential releases over the last five years.  Due to the effective release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN \n\nThe Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's Water Treatment Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidential releases of chlorine and other hazardous materials, which has been coordinated with the local"
