Foster Farms revised this document, previously submitted in November 2009 update, due to the required 5-year revalidation of their process hazard analysis and regulatory requirements requiring re-submittal within six months of a change that resulted in a revised process hazard analysis and also the EPA RMP 5-year re-submittal requirements.  \n\n\n\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in these systems exceeds the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold reporting quantities.\n\n\n\nMany state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.  Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM programs.  In the unlikely event that a ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facility.  The systems provide cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, product, water"

The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Farmerville Complex due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for a facility and an alternative release scenario for each covered chemical.  The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP submittal.    \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, Foster Farms also performs periodic audits and hazards reviews to enhance continued safe performance.  Recommended actions to improve safety are identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for completion as required. \n\n\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.
