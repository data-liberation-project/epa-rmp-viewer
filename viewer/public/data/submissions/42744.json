We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community, as well as the protection of the environment.  The executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00bf\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our accidental release programs\n\u00bf\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our emergency response program\n\u00bf\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe information supplied in this RMP submittal is accurate and up-to-date.  Since the initial RMP submittal in 1999, the W.G. Krummrich plant has significantly changed.  Several processes have been shut down and future reductions are expected.   These shutdowns have reduced two RMP chemicals at the site to below their threshold amounts: Anhydrous Ammonia and Nitric Acid.  In addition, expected future shutdowns will significantly reduce the on-site storage volume of Chlorine.\n\n1.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe W.G. Krummrich Plant is the second oldest in the U.S. Solutia Plants, with approximately 200 employees.  In 1917, as part of Monsanto, the site was purchased from the Commercial Acids Company, which had started the plant in 1907 to manufacture sulfuric, muriatic and nitric acids.  Today the plant occupies over 300 acres and manufactures a variety of chemical intermediates.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to c"

Krummrich plant as a recovered material that is stored for sale.\n\n-Chlorine\n\nSuppliers ship chlorine in rail cars to the W.G. Krummrich plant.  Solutia has implemented strict unloading and handling procedures for this material.  A number of 90-ton rail cars are stored in the plant and are used by one department.   The chlorine is used directly from the rail cars through state-of-the-art unloading/vaporization systems.  Solutia\u00bfs W. G. Krummrich plant uses chlorine as a raw material in the manufacture of building block chemicals used to make swimming pool water treatment products.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n2.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

Our plant is continually upgrading its operations and safety systems to improve the level of protection.  Each area of the plant undergoes a Process Hazards Analysis whenever a new project or change is made and on a five year basis, a full hazard analysis is conducted of each department.   These hazard analyses help to target areas that may need further safety improvement or upgrades, therefore allowing the plant to continue upgrading the safety systems needed for a safe work environment for our employees and visitors."
