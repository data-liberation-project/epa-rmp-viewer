The management and employees of the Galesburg facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Methylacetylene-Propadiene/ Propylene/ Propane Mixtures (MAPP). If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe Galesburg operation is a MAPP storage and distribution facility which is generally unmanned. When manned, the facility's primary operation is the distribution, unloading of MAPP from railcars (35,000 gal/ 144,700 lb.) into two 18,000 gal. (73,400 lb.) high pressure ASME storage tanks. The MAPP is then transfilled into DOT approver road tankers and distributed to customers.\n\nAirgas-Mid America manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that the appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\nThe facility developed prevention prog"

This facility was designed and constructed to comply with Applicable State and industry codes.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or property damage on the site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nAt this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. The facility has an emergency response plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work. The Emergency Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to insure that it is current."
