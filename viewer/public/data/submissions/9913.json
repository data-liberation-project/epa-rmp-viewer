      "SummaryText": "Farmers Coop Association is an agricultural retail business that primarily stores and blends fertilizer for sale to farmers, as well as handle bulk propane for area homes and businesses.  Our NH3 facility stores approximately 245,000 pounds and our propane plant can store nearly 177,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario for NH3 would release 132,000 pounds with a distance to endpoint of 2.5 miles affecting 283 people.  Propane's worst case scenario would be a vapor cloud explosion releasing 105,000 pounds with a distance to endpoint of .6 miles affecting 12 individuals.  Training for employees is done on a annual basis with employees attending local and state training schools.  Our facilities, including tanks, valves and piping are maintained in accordance with local, state and federal rules and regulations as well as OSHA's standards such as 29 CFR 1910.111 and NFPA-58.  Our training program allows us to report that in the last five years the facilities mentioned above have experienced no injury accidents.  This company's Emergency Response Plan is updated annually and is shared with and discussed with the Talmage Fire Dept.  They've agreed to be our first responder and will act in the event of an emergency.  Periodic evaluations are done on each of our plants to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  We have no plans at the present time to implement any changes in the coming year."
