The maximum quantitiy released would be 52,250 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 2.6 miles.  Randolph Fertilizer Co., has all excess flow devices, Emergency Shut off valves and breakaway valves in place, required by th ANSI Standards and State Requirements.
