These releases did not have any offsite consequences. The new dechlorination facility will be in operation  by the summer of 2002. Therefore, currently we do not have any history for the accidental release of sulfur dioxide.\n\n6.\tThe Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant has designated the Detroit Fire Department as the official responder. We have a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\tIn the event of fire and other emergencies at the DWWTP, employees are alerted by an alarm system to evacuate the affected area to the safe zone. The public will also be notified.  Flashing red lights are provided at  the entrances to the chlorination and dechlorination  buildings to indicate the presence of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. Flashing red light is also provided at the junction chamber to indicate the presence of chlorine.\n\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tDWWTP has planned several modifications to the chlorine facility such as relocation of the current facility and installation of new equipment to improve the overall safety of the chlorination process. Maintenance section has planned to intensify their training of new employees on the new equipment."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\tThe owner or operator of a stationary source subject to the risk management program rule under the Clean Air Act, section 112 (r) (7) of 40 CFR Part 68 is required to submit a single Risk Management Plan that includes the information required in \u00a7\u00a7 68.155 through 68.185 for all covered processes. As specified in \u00a7 68.155, the owner or operator must provide an executive summary that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Plan. At Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant (DWWTP), chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater and it is stored in 90 ton tank cars. The construction of a new dechlorination facility is in its final phase at DWWTP. The new dechlorination process will be in operation by the summer of 2002  and DWWTP will use  sulfur dioxide  to remove residual chlorine, or dechlorinate, the treated wastewater to protect organisms in the river when it is discharged. Sulfur dioxide will also be stored in 90 ton tank cars. The following elements describe the Risk Management Plan as per \u00a7 68.155, for the existing Chlorination and the new Dechlorination processes at the Detroit Wastewater treatment Plant.\n\n1.\tThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary \tsource.\n\n\tDetroit Water and Sewerage Department, under which DWWTP is being operated, is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The chlorination and dechlorination processes at Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant  have been designed and constructed per the applicable codes and engineering standards.  Currently, the chlorination process is working and meets  the good engineering practices. Also, a preventive maintenance program consisting of equipment calibration and replacement of components to maintain process performance has been implemented for the chlorination process. The new dechlorination process will also meet the good engineering practices and will have a preventive maintenance program  when it is in operati"

      "SummaryText": "on. The tank car inspection, cleaning,  repair, interior system tests and relief valve tests  are made by the supplier for chlorine and will be made by the supplier for sulfur dioxide.  \n\n\tAt DWWTP, a set of nine (9) detectors are placed throughout the roof of the administration building and at the junction chamber.  Their function is to warn of chlorine gas in the air and to activate the automatic shut off mechanism of the air intake to the various parts of the building affected.  The signals from these detectors are transmitted to the Computer Control Room and the Special Laboratory in addition to the annunciator in the chlorine room.\n\n\tA sulfur dioxide leak will be detected by the gas detector system. Sulfur dioxide sensors are located in the tank car storage building,  chemical feed equipment room, and in the basement. The area of the alarm or malfunction will be indicated on the control panels. Alarm information will be sent to annunciator panels in the tank car storage building, Dechlorination facility maintenance room, Dechlorination control room and to the scrubber.\n\n\tThe caustic soda air wash system chemically neutralizes chlorine as well as sulfur dioxide from a leak inside the building before the gas escapes to the outside atmosphere.\n\n\tFlashing red lights are provided at  the entrances to the chlorination and dechlorination  buildings.  This is to alert the area personnel that  there is or was a leak inside the buildings. Flashing red light at the Junction Chamber is a signal that indicates that there is or was chlorine in the vicinity of Chlorine Chamber.  \n\n\tDetroit Wastewater Treatment Plant has designated the Detroit Fire Department as the official responder in case of an accidental release. The plant supervisor will also notify the police to be prepared for an evacuation of the neighboring residents if the need occurs. Other agencies to be notified in the event of an accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide are City of Detroit Local Emergen"

During wet weather periods, incremental flows above 930 MGD receive primary treatment and disinfection prior to discharge to the Detroit River. At the pump stations, raw wastewater from the Jefferson Interceptor, Oakwood Interceptor and North Interceptor-East Arm receive coarse screening and grit removal and is then pumped to the primary tanks.  Ferrous chloride is added to the raw wastewater for phosphorous removal.  The wastewater is pumped from the Intermediate Lift Pump Station to the secondary treatment facilities where  treatment is provided by the activated sludge method.  Following final clarification, the wastewater is disinfected by the addition of chlorine, and discharged to the Detroit River. The disinfected wastewater will be dechlorinated by the addition of sulfur dioxide,  before it is discharged to the Detroit River when the new dechlorination process is  in operation.  Treated wastewater can be discharged to the Rouge River if hydraulically or structurally necessary. The primary solids and secondary activated solids are gravity thickened and dewatered by either centrifuge or belt filter presses.  The main sludge disposal method is by incineration and landfill of the ash.  Excess sludge is lime stabilized and landfilled.\n\n\tThe primary components of the chlorination process are four (4) 90 ton rail cars, two (2) steam vaporizers, nine (9) hot water evaporators, two (2) hot water circulation pumps, one (1) gas fired hot water h"

The Plant keeps at least one spare chlorine tank car as a back up unit.\n\n            The primary components of the dechlorination process are six(6) 90 ton rail cars, fourteen (14) evaporators, fourteen (14) sulfonators, fourteen (14) 3 injectors, two (2) diffusers and the scrubber system.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and The Alternative Release Scenario.\n\t\n\tThe Risk Management Program Rule states that the owner or operator of a stationary source with program 3 processes should analyze and report one worst case release scenario, representing all regulated chemicals, that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an end point provided, and one alternate scenario for each regulated toxic chemical.\n\n\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario at DWWTP involves the release of 90 tons of sulfur dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes when the tank car is outside the building.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/second (m/s) wind speed, the downwind distance to the toxic end point of 0.0078 mg/L as obtained from the gas dispersion model ALOHA ( Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres ) was greater than its maximum cut off distance of 6 miles. Therefore, the EPA's model RMP* Comp was used to model this scenario which results in the definite distance of 16 miles.\n\t\n\tThe Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine involves the breakage of one of the header pipes and the failure of excess flow valve.  In this event, chlorine is released at its maximum limit of 15,000 lb./hr over a duration of 30 minutes which is the maximum allowed duration for correcting any chlorine release problem.  Under class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the downwind  distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L that obtained from the gas dispersion model ALOHA was 2.1 miles.\n\n\tThe Alternative Release Scenario"

The training consists of reviewing the  manuals and actual hands-on field operation of the equipment.  Leak detection and equipment isolation procedures are also included in this training. Periodic training will be provided for the operations laboratory and maintenance staff personnel assigned to the dechlorination process when the new facility is in operation.\n\n\tThe preventive maintenance program consists of equipment calibration and replacement of components to maintain process performance.  The chlorine  monitoring devices are calibrated monthly and after each alarm event.  Rupture disc replacement is performed annually to prevent premature chlorine  releases caused by eroded or fatigued disks.  A total inspection and/or replacement of the process piping are performed at 5 year intervals. The sensors in the dechlorination facility have micro processors that contain instructions and store information. They are programmable, self-diagnostic, and will alert the control monitor if calibration or replacement is necessary.  \n\n5.\tThe five -year accident history.\n\n\tWe have had 35 accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years (from April 1997 to April 2002) and they were all small and"
