      "SummaryText": "ed, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n- Incident Investigation - The El Paso Facility investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented. An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures. There have been no such incidents involving the El Paso Facility EtO system.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo EtO releases that caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the El Paso Facility during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe El Paso Facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility employees will not\nrespond to EtO accidental release. Instead, the facility has coordinated with the local response\nagency to respond to any EtO release that may occur at the facility. The main elements of the\nemergency action plan are: (1) Internal assembly during investigation (using the EtO monitors); (2) Evacuation of the facility if the monitoring threshold is exceeded; and (3) Procedures for external notifications and coordination with local agencies and first responders.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following improvements are planned in the near future:\n- Upgrades to design of vaporizer coils \n- Upgrades to ventilation system\n- Enhanced inspection programs for door jacket bolts to mitigate risk of progressive loosening and deterioration"

      "SummaryText": "ies\n\nThe El Paso Facility's accidental release prevention program integrates proven technology,\nequipment maintenance, employee training, and emergency response.\nThe El Paso Facility is equipped with an automatic fire sprinkler system, both ceiling mounted and in-rack storage. In addition, the EtO supply drums are bonded, grounded and chained, and only nonsparking tools are used to make drum connections. The lines are purged with nitrogen prior to change out of drums and empty drums receive a nitrogen over-blanket. EtO from each supply drum is vaporized prior to its introduction into the vessels. The nitrogen gas is also steam heated prior to its introduction into the sterilization chambers. The chambers are computer controlled by a programmable logic control system and a system of passwords ensures that only authorized personnel have access to the controls.\nBoth EtO processes at the facility (including the drum storage rooms) are equipped with an EtO\nremoval and destruction system.\n\n- The EL Plant system has a Hydrox Scrubber System plus two Donaldson Abator (thermal\noxidizer) units. Exhaust from the sterilization chambers is delivered to the Hydrox Scrubber system where the spent EtO is converted into ethylene glycol. Exhaust from the aeration rooms is routed to the abator units to combust the gas mixture and convert EtO to carbon dioxide and water. In addition, the EL Plant EtO storage room is provided with three safe-cell systems. Each safe cell is capable of destructing 150 pounds of EtO should there be a leak. The EtO removal efficiency in the safe-cells is about 99%. The safe-cells are activated by the EtO monitoring system (baseline monitoring system), which has an EtO sensor inside the EtO storage room.\n- The E2 plant has passive hydrolyzers followed by active, packed bed wet scrubbing hydrolyzers\nwhich convert spent EtO into ethylene glycol. The storage room and sterilizers are vented to one of the active packed bed wet scrubbers to convert any fugitive Et"

      "SummaryText": "Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe El Paso Facility of Isomedix Operations Inc. (Steris Applied Sterilization Technologies) uses\nethylene oxide (EtO) to sterilize pre-packaged supplies for health care facilities. EtO is highly\neffective in killing bacteria, insects, and fungi and serves as an efficient means for sterilization in\nsystems where heat cannot be used to kill such organisms. The use of EtO as a sterilant has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was first introduced. However, EtO is a hazardous substance (it is both flammable and toxic), such that storing and handling EtO without proper precautions can present a risk to employees and the public. The El Paso Facility considers safe practices in storing and using EtO to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with EtO.\nThe El Paso Facility incorporates two sterilization processes on contiguous property in the Vista del Sol Industrial Park, with a main address at 1435 Isomedix Place in El Paso, Texas. The original plant has been using EtO since 1990 and is referred to as the EL Plant. The newer plant began routine operation in 2009 and is referred to as the E2 Plant. Located on contiguous property to the EL Plant, the E2 Plant has an address of 1441 Don Haskins Drive. EtO is received in drums into designated storage areas at both the EL Plant and the E2 Plant. \nThe El Paso Facility is subject to EPA regulation 40 CFR 68 and has prepared this Risk\nManagement Plan (RMP) submission because an accidental release of EtO could cause a toxic\nimpact offsite. In addition, the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\nrule at 29 CFR 1910.119 because EtO is both toxic and flammable and would impact employee\nsafety if it were released onsite. Expansion of the E2 Plant is scheduled to be complete in 1Q 2023; consequently, the RMP is being revised and updated as required.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polic"
