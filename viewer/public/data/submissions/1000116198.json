The Brecksville LP Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Brecksville, OH. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum-based additives.\n\nBrecksville LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\nC. A five-year, RMP-reportable accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Brecksville LP Terminal butane tank blending process has been classified as Program Level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of its flammable effects, it is necessary to obse"

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures associated with the Butane Tank Blending Process.\n\nThe Butane Tank Blending is a batch-type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and piped directly to and injected into the gasoline recirculation line associated with the product tank to be blended. Process safety controls include an emergency shutoff valve with multiple, isolation valves, and a fusible element along with a \"Smart-Hose\", low emission hose coupler, and thermal/hydrostatic pressure reliefs. Access to the Brecksville LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Brecksville LP Terminal accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/response programs help Marathon effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the Ohio EPA (Ohio Administrative Code Rule 3745-104.) The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Brecksville LP Terminal:\n\n1) Employee Participation;\n2) Process Safety Information;\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\n4) Operating Procedures;\n5) Training;\n6) Contractors;\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review;\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance/Inspection/Testing;\n9) Hazardous Work Permits;\n10)Manageme"

In addition to the above elements, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering/administrative controls to help identify/contain/control a release and reduce the resulting potential impacts. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and corporate standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (hydrostatic/thermal pressure relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Redundant control systems;\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation:\n\nThe worst-case release quantity is based on the total volume of the process conservatively assuming all lines are filled.  The alternate-case release quantity is based on a reported per minute rate for 10 minutes assuming connection to a transport.\n\n-Process and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible element);\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n-Low-emission transport coupler, \"Smart-Hose\" with design break-away and self-closing valves on each end.\n\nGeneral Emergency Response:\n\n-Emergency alert system;\n-Periodic emergency training f"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, a Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/\"Smart Plan\" is in place for the Facility with response activities coordinated with Richfield Fire Department/Brecksville Fire Department.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Brecksville LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal maintains records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions. There have been no RMP-reportable accidents within the past five (5) years.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility is identified as a \"Non-Responding\" facility with its emergency response plans being coordinated with the Richfield Fire Department/Brecksville Fire Department and Cuyahoga County Office of Emergency Management.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Brecksville LP Terminal butane tank blending system, it is the policy of the Terminal to initially contact the Richfield Fire Department/Brecksville Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains incipient fire response and HAZWOPER 1st Responder Operations capabilities.\n\nThe Richfield Fire Department/Brecksville Fire Department participates in annual butane training/coordination sessions for this system.\n\nE.
