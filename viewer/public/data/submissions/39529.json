      "SummaryText": "The Britz Fertilizers, Inc. facility located near Madera, California sells agricultural chemicals directly to farmers.\n\nThe facility has a training program for employees who handle chemicals and an inspection program by management to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  Employees are trained for emergency release to accidental releases.  The facility has a program for emergency notification of the Madera County Fire Protection District in the event of a accidental release which threatens to go off-site.  There are some residences within the range of the toxic end point of the worst case scenario.\n\nOne material (ammonia), in the form of anhydrous ammonia, which is listed in the RMP program, is handled at a volume in excess of the threshhold amount.\n\nThere is one processe at this facility which handles the ammonia:\n\n        1.  Anhydrous Ammonia Storage/Load-out (18,000 gallon gross water capacity) @ 78,000 pounds.\n        \nProgram 2 is the default program level for all facilities.  This faciliy does not manufacture fertilizers.  It purchases the agricultural chemicals wholesale and sells them retail directly to the farmers, who then use the products.  As such, it is not an OSHA PSM facility, nor is it under an NAICS code which requires a Program 3.  The facility has few public receptors within the worst-case zone and therefore does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 is therefore selected for this facility.\n\nThe prevention program emphasises procedural and managerial steps which enhance maintenance and training.  There have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nThe emergency response program includes a facility-specific evacuation plan for which the personnel receive training, as well as the county-wide emergency response plan with the Madera County Fire Protection District as the designated responding unit, and the provision for notifying other agencies in the event of a release which threatens to go off-site.\n\nThe facility has an ongoing training pr"
