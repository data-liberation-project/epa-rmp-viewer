Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Rose Packing Company, Inc., A Division of OSI Industries, LLC (Rose Packing), Chicago facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    Rose Packing's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?

Rose Packing's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Rose Packing; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Rose Packing is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Rose Packing's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emer"

Facility Identification\n\nThe Rose Packing facility is located at 4900 South Major Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility is a manufacturer of fresh, smoked and processed pork products for the retail and food service industries.  Operations include packing, cooking and processing meats. Rose Packing produces Canadian Style Bacon and a full line of raw and fully cooked pork sausage, ethnic sausage and back ribs.  The facility also makes hams, smoked pork shoulder butts, sectioned and formed processed pork, fresh boneless backs, pork roasts and pork tenderloins.  The NAICS code for the facility is 311612.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system contains a charge of 49,000 pounds of ammonia, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nAn aerial map has been provided in Appendix B. \n\n\n\nIV.

The most recent audit of the PSM program was concluded on June 7, 2018, and the next audit will be conducted on, or before June 7, 2021, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at Rose Packing have assisted in developing the initial PHA and the five (5) year PHA revalidation for the ammonia process.  In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures.\n\n?    Process Safety Information - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of August 30, 2018.\n\n?

Incident Investigation - Rose Packing has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure also makes provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n?    Compliance Audit - The facility completed an original RMP on June 17, 1999 for the ammonia refrigeration system that held a charge of 34,000 pounds of ammonia. Through modifications made to the ammonia refrigeration system, the amount of ammonia present in the system is now estimated at approximately 49,000 pounds.

Emergency Response Program\n\nRose Packing has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), updated February 11, 2019, to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release. Response activities are coordinated with the Central Stickney Fire Department (which coordinates response activities with the Mabis 10 HAZMAT Team). This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an EAP on file at the plant. According to the EAP, facility employees are responsible for investigating and assisting the fire department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Action Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates.
