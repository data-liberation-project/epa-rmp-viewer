The source of water for this facility is the Cumberland River.  Part of the treatment process involves disinfection with chlorine to kill pathogenic organisms and to provide safe water to HVUD customers.  To provide this capability, the HVUD Water Treatment Plant has a chemical storage and feed building built specifically to handle and feed chlorine in our treatment process.  At any given time, this facility contains 24 one ton cylinders of chlorine.\n\nThe basic goal of our chemical treatment staff is the safe and effective handling of chlorine.  Our safety philosophy is orientated toward affirmative control and minimization of risk to the greatest extent possible.  Every reasonable effort is made to accomplish this goal.  We must meet requirements set down in the OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (29 CFR 1910.110), and also by EPCRA Section 302.  Our personnel are thoroughly trained, and our equipment is inspected regularly by our personnel, equipment vendors, or both.\n\nHVUD completed and implemented our Process Safety Management plan and Emergency Response Plan concerning chlorine storage and handling five years ago.  Both of these programs have recently been inspected by regulatory authorities.  We continue to maintain these programs in order to comply with federal and state regulations and to provide a safe working environment for our employees.  These plans include employee training on safe handling of chlorine, response procedures to a chlorine leak, review of the chlorine system including a process hazard analysis, and operation and inspection procedures for our chlorine equipment.  The chlorine building includes chlorine detectors which will sound alarms when chlorine levels in the air exceed 1 part per million.  We have self-contained breathin"

We have maintained a Respiratory Protection Program in conjunction with our Emergency Response Program which trains our employees in the proper use and care of our SCBA?s.  Emergency repair kits for chlorine cylinders are located at strategic points in the plant.  Our Emergency Response Plan has specific procedures for contacting other related agencies and the public in the event of an accidental release.  The Metropolitan Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) will be notified of any chlorine release of 10 pounds or greater, or any chlorine leak which cannot be contained utilizing tools and procedures immediately available on site.  Our employees have been trained in notification requirements.  Training for these programs has been conducted as recently as October of 2003.  \n\nThe Harpeth Valley Utilities District Water Treatment Plant has experienced no accidents resulting in a reportable release in the last five years.  We will continue to train our personnel regularly on all chlorine emergency response and notification procedures."
