In addition, since the initial plan submittal, offloading procedures have been developed to minimize any significant release.  A spill berm and a collection sump have been constructed to contain and manage any outside release.  The hydrochloric acid tank is housed inside and includes a tank-in-tank system designed to contain any spills or leaks from the original storage vessel.  A real time level sensor monitors the tank at all times and is recorded daily.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nHamlin has had no incidents involving hydrochloric acid over the last five years."

Both EPA and OSHA consider this chemical hazardous. Hydrochloric acid is used in the general manufacturing process which includes pressing, annealing, cleaning and plating of reed blades and the assembly of reed switches, relays and sensors. Hydrochloric acid has been utilized is a safe manner at this facility. No release of significant nature has occurred within the operating history of the plant. It is the policy of Hamlin to adhere to the Federal and State laws governing the use of chemicals but to extend Hamlin's safety, health and environmental efforts beyond that of government requirements. Hamlin is a registered facility for ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS). Hamlin received this designation in June 2002 and has successfully achieved recertification for three subsequent audits. Hamlin is committed to the safety and health of the employees and the well being of the community.\n\nHamlin's emergency response program is based on OSHA and EPA models for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) regulations. Hamlin coordinates all emergency activities internally with provisions to incorporate and organize efforts with local and state agencies.\n\nThe stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\nThe plating and cleaning process uses concentrated hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid is maintained within the system, consisting of a single storage tank for hydrochloric acid with a secondary tank acting as a safety capture system in case of over-fill or a tank leak.  The secondary tank has the capacity of 110% of the storage tank.  In addition, the tank is located inside and the chemical room is also designed as a containment area.  Deliveries are scheduled 2-3 times per year and accomplished through tractor-trailer delivery.  The fill port"
