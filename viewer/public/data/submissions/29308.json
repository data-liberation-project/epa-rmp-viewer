Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSeadrift Operations of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The information from the Risk Management Plan has been shared with plant neighbors, LEPC members, elected officials, and other community members through public meetings.  Input on the plan has been received from the Community Advisory Panel and has been incorporated into the plan as well as the public communication sessions.\n\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUnion Carbide Seadrift Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces approximately 2.4 billion pounds of plastic, rubber, and other chemical products in its various operating plants.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide and Dow processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Site, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\n\n Union Carbide Seadrift  Operations has the following RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances in quantities above"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, appear in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\n\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 294,000 pounds of ethylene oxide as a gas to the atmosphere.   An administrative control limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85% (294,000pounds).  According to EPA\u00bfs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public .  The following administrative control is used in this analysis:\n Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85 percent (294,000 pounds).\n\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Double Wall Tank:  The tank has a secondary tank wall which is designed to contain a leak in the primary wall.\nSecondary Wall Leak Detection:  A sensor is designed to detect leaks between the primary and secondary walls of the tank.\n Enclosed Tanks:  The surge tanks are inside concrete containment walls and covered with gravel to minimize the potential for external impact.\nSecondary Containment Around Tanks:  The area around the tanks is di"

The area is always under surveillance of a remotely operated camera to detect unusual circumstances.\n Flares:  Pressure relief devices are routed to a flare for destruction of  ethylene oxide.\nFire Water Monitors:  In addition to the sprinkler-deluge system, area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress ethylene oxide vapors.\n  \nAlternative Release Scenarios --\n\nEthylene Oxide:  This scenario assumes a loss of containment of ethylene oxide from a leak of 1550 lb/min from  the surge tank.  This scenario is from the same vessel as that in the toxics worst case, above, so the mitigating controls are the same.\n \nPropylene Oxide:  This scenario assumes a loss of containment in the storage tank or  piping, releasing 1410 lb/min over 2 hours.   According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public.  The tank is diked to provide passive mitigation of a release.  In addition, the following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n Emergency Shutdown System:  An automatic high level and pressure ESD will isolate the tank.  In a addition, a manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the pumps and put the valves in a fail-safe position.

According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public.  The following  mitigation measure is used in this analysis:\n Leak Detection:  Ammonia leak detectors, installed in the vicinity of the recycle tank sound an alarm in the control room if a leak should occur.

Particular attention is given during transfers when the risk of overflow is greatest.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Maximum Level:  Procedures require that the tank level does not exceed 85% of its capacity.\n Spill Response:  Fire water monitors  are available in the area to reduce emissions.\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride:  This scenario assumes that an unloading hose attached to the storage cylinder ruptures and releases the entire contents (6,200 pounds) to the air.   According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public.  The following active and passive mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n Hose Size:  The cylinders are unloaded with \u00bd\u00bf diameter hoses which limits the rate that the  material that can be released.\n Cylinder Size:  The material is delivered in relatively small quantities and only one cylinder is connected at a time.  Therefore the amount of material that can be released is limited.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Pad Drains:  Concrete around the cylinder is sloped to a containment sump and is able to contain the entire contents of  the cylinder plus rainfall.\n Leak Detectors:  The area contains sensors capable of alarming when a leak is detected.  The sensors also automatically activate the deluge system and automatically isolate the supply cylinder from the process when a significant leak is detected.\n Surveillance:  Personnel remain in the area when the cylinders are being unloaded to the tank."

The following administrative control was used in this analysis:\nInventory Restriction:  An administrative control limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 90 percent (216,000 pounds).\n \nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Secondary Containment Dike:  The dike contains and minimizes 1-butene evaporation to the atmosphere.\n Combustible Gas Detectors:  This system is designed to detect flammable vapor and to automatically activate the deluge system (water spray) to help suppress flammable vapor.\n Emergency Shutdown System:  The manual emergency shutdown system is designed to isolate the tank and pump, and to actuate the deluge system.\n Deluge System:  A water spray system is designed to help suppress 1-butene vapors.  It is actuated by combustible gas detectors or the emergency shutdown system.  A foam trailer is also available in the area for fire fighting. \nFire water monitors are located stragically around the tank to assist in fire fighting and suppress vapor emissions.\nSafety valves and vents are routed to a flare for destruction. \nMonitoring and Surveillance:  The tank pressure an"

      "SummaryText": "Audits:  Periodic Corporate and plant-led audits and assessments are conducted to ensure that process operations comply with governmental  and Union Carbide/Dow requirements.\nProcess Risk Management Program: All covered plants have a comprehensive program to ensure that all the elements listed above are implemented.  This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\n5.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Seadrift Operations that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n Evacuation and shelter-in-place plans and accounting for personnel after an incident\n Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addit"

      "SummaryText": "ion to the plant emergency squad, the site maintains the ability to respond to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Calhoun County Emergency Planning Committee and the community.  A Mutual Aid Network has been established with Calhoun County and other local chemical plants to further enhance the ability to respond to an emergency.\n\n7.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Seadrift Site to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n Complete the Layers of Protection Analysis for all affected plants and ensure the necessary layers are in place.\n Conduct periodic process hazard analyses for all processes and implement resulting recommendations for improvements to safety equipment and procedures.\nConduct New Leader Reviews so that newly assigned production leaders have all of the process safety and reactive chemicals information necessary for their new jobs.\n All new projects are designed around principles of inherent safety so that process safety is integrated directly into the design.\n Changes to new or revised systems seek to minimize the quantities of hazardous materials."
