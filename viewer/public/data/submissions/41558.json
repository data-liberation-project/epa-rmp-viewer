      "SummaryText": "a.\tThe Englewood Water District water treatment facility was installed to chlorinate water for Charlotte County, Englewood service subscribers.  The facility is located at 140 Telman Road.  The station includes a chlorine storage area, which contains liquid chlorine containers, chlorinators, and various types of related safety equipment.  A maximum of 4 one-ton containers of chlorine are found in the chlorine storage area (two on-line and two for backup.)  One 2 ton-cylinder is connected to the chlorination system on site at any given time.  The facility is occupied staffed 16 hours a day 7 days a week and on call 24 hours a day, and qualifies as a Program 3 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\nb.\tThe Englewood Water District accidental release prevention program at the Telman Road facility involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and adheres to all applicable procedures of EPA.  The Englewood Water District emergency response program is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program (\u00bfERP\u00bf) requirements.\n\nc.\tThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst-case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release.\u00bf  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the\u00bfmaximum quantity in the largest vessel\u00bfis released as a gas over 10 minutes,\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\u00bf\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00bftoxic endpoint\u00bf selected by EPA of 3 parts per million (\u00bfppm\u00bf), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (\u00bfERPG-2\u00bf).

The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n\n(a)\t It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.  The 3 ppm one-hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten-minute release time; the value obtained is 7.3 ppm.  Thus a secondary toxic endpoint of 7 ppm was also considered during interpretation of the results of the 10-minute worst-case release.\n\n(b)\tOnly the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6.25% of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily maximum temperature (96oF), and average relative humidity (74%) were inputs for analysis of both toxic endpoints.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case s"

The alternative release scenario involves tank failure and partial release of 1 of the one-ton cylinders connected to the chlorination system.  The amount of chlorine released is 2,000 lb over 60 minutes.  Typical meteorological conditions were used: atmospheric stability of D, wind speed of 3.7 m/s, average air temperature of 72.2oF, and 74% relative humidity.
