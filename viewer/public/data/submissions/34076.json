              "Description": "The Somerset Plant's only covered chemical is chlorine dioxide (ClO2).  ClO2 is produced onsite and is used to bleach kraft pulp.  The prevention program covers the ClO2 generating plant, the ClO2 delivery system to the bleach plant where it first mixes with the pulp, and the ClO2 gas collection system from the main collection header to the F-7 fans discharge.  The plan consists of engineered systems and a management system.  Engineered systems include an air sweep process for the storage tanks, automated shut off valves, and enclosure for suction piping, safety relief systems on the storage tanks, generator and dump tanks, and ClO2 alarms that trigger at 0.3 ppm.  The plant has an onsite HAZMAT team and conducts annual response training exercises with the local fire and police departments as well as other responders.  The plant also maintains a SAFER gas dispersion modeling system that uses real time meteorological data.  The management system is based on the 14 aspects of OSHA's PSM program found at 29 C.F.R. 1910.119.",

Warren is committed to operating the Somerset Mill in Skowhegan, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  S.D. Warren has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  S.D. Warren has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\nB. The plant provides bleach kraft pulp from a single continuous Kamyr digester and a Bleach Plant.  In 1982, the first of three high-speed, lightweight coated paper machines was built, followed by additional paper machines in 1986 and 1990.  The plant currently produces approximately 1,500 tons/day of bleach pulp, which is used in the production of approximately 2,200 tons/day of bleached fine kraft paper.  The plant has two power boilers and two turbine generators which supply steam and electricity for the plant's operations.  Excess electricity is supplied to the local utility.  The plant has its own onsite wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and a solid waste disposal facility.  The plant is located adjacent to Kennebec River from which it draws approximately 25,000,000 gallons a day (mgd) to support operations.  The water is treated in an on-site water treatment facility before use.   Chlorine dioxide is the RMP covered substance at the plant.\n\nC. The Plant is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident h"
