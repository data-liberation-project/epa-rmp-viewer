      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The stationary source is the Houston Retail Support Center located at 4625 Woodfern Road, Houston, TX.  The site is owned and operated by HE Butt Grocery Company. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of approximately 22,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan has been provided to the local LEPC for review.\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThis food distribution facility operates a multi-temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with a refrigeration load of 550 TR and an engine room compressor capacity of 1465 TR @ +20?F suction temperature.This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system. \n\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains four interconnected sub-systems:\n1.Evaporator sy"

X 13'-10\" OAL vertical pump re-circulator package +20?F.\n?One-Hansen APC Auto-Purger.\n\nMajor equipment located outside on the roof includes: \n?Three evaporative condensers (all Imeco XLP-XL-710, each rated for 6,690 MBH @ +95? FCT/ 79? FWB).\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high temperature recirculator (V-1) as "

      "SummaryText": "the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated in this hazard assessment include two possible scenarios. First alternate scenario (OCA-2) is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (57.6 lbs/min) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes.\n\nThe second alternative scenario (OCA-3) is the direct release of liquid from a ?\"   diameter hole/valve in a vessel having an internal pressure of 181.1 psig.  The size of this release is based on a ten (10) minute release duration at a release rate calculated from the simplified Bernoulli equation found on page 4-14 in Chapter 4 of the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\" \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing oper"

These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments.
