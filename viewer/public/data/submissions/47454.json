      "SummaryText": "The Otis Spunkmeyer facility located in Chaska, Minnesota is a frozen bakery goods processing facility that handles ammonia, which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this facility is to prepare bakery goods for freezing and cold storage. Flour and other ingredients are mixed and shaped.  The material is then frozen, packaged, and held in cold storage.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\r\n\r\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration system was new as of 1999 and an accidental release prevention program was implemented.  The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes, as available during the time of construction.  Equipment up grades have been scheduled as warranted to maintain the equipment.   This food processing facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \r\n\r\nOtis Spu"

      "SummaryText": "nkmeyer implemented some changes to the plant manufacturing areas that resulted in removing a baked / frozen muffins and cakes production operation in October 2003.  This operation was replaced with a new production line for manufacturing frozen breads.  These changes resulted in some ammonia refrigeration equipment being removed and some new ammonia refrigeration equipment being installed.  The capacity charge of ammonia refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration system increased from 13,000 pounds to 15,000 pounds.  The Process Safety Management program was used to manage this change to the ammonia refrigeration system, a Process Safety Hazard Analysis was conducted on the new equipment, a review of the Process Hazard Analysis on the existing equipment was completed, Standard Operating Procedures were reviewed, and training conducted.  The new bread production line was started into production on March 15, 2004.  \r\n\r\nAnother facility expansion occurred in 2006 where a new and larger High Pressure Receiver, two Low Temperature Recirculators were installed along with a new freezer system.  The capacity charge of ammonia refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration system increased from 15,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds.  The Process Safety Management program was used to manage this change to the ammonia refrigeration system, a Process Safety Hazard Analysis was conducted on the new equipment, a review of the Process Hazard Analysis on the existing equipment was completed, Standard Operating Procedures were reviewed, and training conducted.  The new production line was started into production on August 15, 2006.  The Chaska plant now operates four frozen bread dough production lines at this facility.  \r\n\r\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.    \r\n\u00bf\tMost of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \r\n\u00bf\tMost of the evaporator emergency shut off valves are located on the roof.  \r\n\u00bf\tThe Plant has"

This program also consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \r\n\u00bf\tA detailed process hazard review was conducted in July 2006.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The recommendations are being implemented on a time table.  \r\n\u00bf\tWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \r\n\u00bf\tFor projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \r\n\u00bf\tContractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.
