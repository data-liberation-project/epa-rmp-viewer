The worst case scenario considered for this process involves the flammable substance Ethyl Ether and the toxic substances Chloroform, Formaldehyde, Furan and Vinyl Acetate.  \n\nThe worse case scenario considered for the flammable substance Ethyl Ether is as follows: the quantity released in the scenario is assumed to be 20,000 lbs.  Passive mitigation considered in the scenario includes dikes, enclosures and sumps.  The tank farm area is roof covered and is provided with concrete containment large enough to hold the contents of the largest tank.  During the modeled worst-case scenario, a leak occurs and the Ethyl Ether, from the tank, vaporizes.  A resulting vapor cloud explosion occurs having a distance to endpoint of 0.20 miles.  This distance is less than the distance, one (1.0) mile, to the nearest public receptor.  The closest off property impact would be to the residential area known as Monkey Run, located southeast of the CCC/GAR facility.\n \nUnder the alternative release scenario, a worst-case scenario was analyzed consisting of a \u00c2\u00bfBLEVE\u00c2\u00bf.

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program covering areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and personnel training associated with the processes at CCC/GAR.  It is CCC/GAR\u00c2\u00bfs policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, CCC has an emergency plan in place coordinated with the Hannibal Rural Fire Department, City of Hannibal Fire Department, and Ralls/Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These local agencies provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n  \nCCC/GAR receives a mixture of solvents used as alternative waste-derived fuel (WDF) materials to replace use of coal.  Compounds in the WDF currently do not exceed the threshold quantity for any substance listed in 40 CFR \u00c2\u00a7 68.130.  Therefore, CCC/GAR is not required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  However, the potential to exceed these threshold quantities does exist.  If the concentration of substances in future alternative WDF changes, threshold quantities can be exceeded.  CCC/GAR routinely tests and closely monitors the quantities of these substances.  Therefore, CCC/GAR is submitting this RMP to insure the facility is in compliance and CCC/GAR\u00c2\u00bfs neighbors are aware of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs worst-case emergency scenario. \n \n2.0\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCCC is a Portland cement manufacturer located approximately 3 miles south of downtown Hann"

      "SummaryText": "ibal, Missouri.  The original cement manufacturing facility was constructed in 1905.  The facility was continuously upgraded and enlarged to its current capacity.  The dry rotary cement kiln system currently online was erected in 2008.  In 1986, CCC was granted interim status under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to operate an alternative WDF facility (GAR).  A mixture of various substances, regulated as hazardous waste primarily due to flammability, are received, stored and prepared for use as alternative WDF in the cement kiln system.  The alternative WDF burns cleaner than coal and serve as a direct replacement of coal.  The alternative WDF consists of spent products such as paints, inks, solvents, oil, and other flammable or combustible organic materials.   Both solid and liquid alternative WDF are received at CCC/GAR.\n\nCCC/GAR tests the WDF regularly to determine concentrations and quantities of regulated substances as defined by the facility\u00c2\u00bfs permit.  Therefore, CCC/GAR has based this \u00c2\u00bfPredictive Filing\u00c2\u00bf Risk Management Plan on the storage and processing of a flammable substance, Ethyl Ether, and the following toxic substances: Chloroform, Formaldehyde, Furan and Vinyl Acetate, assuming it may be received in the future above their respective threshold quantity.  \n \n3.0\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenarios, CCC/GAR used the look-up tables and equations from Appendix D provided by the EPA in the \u00c2\u00bfRMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\u00c2\u00bf document.  The processes at CCC/GAR meet Program 1 eligibility requirements.  However, CCC/GAR has in place all the elements of Program 2.

      "SummaryText": "History\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances at CCC/GAR within the last five (5) years that have led to offsite deaths, injuries, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.    \n \n6.0\tEmergency Response Plan Program\nCCC/GAR has coordinated an emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials, fires and explosions.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n \nTo ensure proper functioning, the facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response equipment is inspected and serviced periodically.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes requiring a modified emergency response.\n \nRalls/Marion County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency plan has been discussed and coordinated.  CCC/GAR is an active member of the LEPC.\n\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCCC/GAR has made several modifications to its process to improve safety.  CCC/GAR has raised six storage tanks located in the alternative liquid WDF blending and storage facility.  The purpose of raising the tanks is to allow for tank bottom inspection and enhanced leak detection.  Other process improvements include the installation of double mechanical seals on existing pumps and the replacement of fuel straining equipment with in-line grinding units.  These improvements reduce the occurrence of leaks and fugitive emissions from the process equipment.  All of the changes have the approval of EPA/MDNR. \n\nCCC/GAR has proposed no other changes to improve safety at this time.\n \n\n\n\n\nCertification Statement\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information"
