Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\n\nRegulated Chemical\nThe design basis is to provide an efficient plant of high purity hydrogen product using Natural Gas, Refinery Fuel Gas A (RFGA), and Butane as feed stock.  Purified Hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s). \nThe plant also produces steam and electricity, sold directly to Conoco Phillips\u00c2\u00bf San Francisco Refinery.  The plant is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention \nThe flammability of this process makes it necessary for the Rodeo Hydrogen Plant to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary exposure, and reduce the threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  It is ALLIUS\u00c2\u00bf policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the material including equipment design and safe handling procedures used to operate the equipment.  ALLIUS\u00c2\u00bf release prevention program is based on inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and an overall commitment to safe work practices.  The Hydrogen equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards.  Operations and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards.\n\nEmergency Response\nALLIUS\u00c2\u00bf Rodeo Plant has developed a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.
