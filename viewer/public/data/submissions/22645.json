To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods- Jacksonville, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods- Jacksonville, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance(s) handled.\n? Poultry Slaughter Facility\n? Anhydrous Ammonia\n? We have on-site approximately 31,000 pounds of ammonia.\n \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case Scenario. - Failure of high-pressure receiver when full releasing 13,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high-pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high-pressure receiver.  The loss of 13,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.3 miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a"

The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n \n A written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n \n All Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc. are designed to meet training requ"
