Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee and also and every three years as required by OSHA. The anhydrous ammonia tank(s) and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. Pressurized tank(s) and plumbing are tested according to the standards for the pressure vessel testing.\r\n\r\nC.\tEmergency Response Policies and Programs\r\n\r\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings. This facility training covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency response practices and procedures. The Emergency Action Plan for this facility is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of a comprehensive review process. In the event of a catastrophic release where the emergency shutoff cannot be activiated, the Bartlett Cooperative Association will call 911 and engage first responders as we are a non-responding facility. \r\n\r\nD.\tWorse-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a worse-case and an alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\r\n\r\nE.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a re"
