      "SummaryText": "The Town of Mooresville Water treatment plant is a modern facility capable of traeting 6 million gallons water per day.  Chlorine is used in the treatment process for disinfection.  The plant has been operated at its present location since 1994 and underwent extensive renovations in 1997.  While remaining committed to the safety of the community and enviroment, we also take pride in observing the most stringent of industrial safety precautions in preventing hazards in the work place, and operate fail-safe contingency plans in case of a mishap.  The approach includes the following:\n\n1.  The latest technology in process and monitoring detection systems.\n\nIn addition, extensive Process Hazard Analysis has been performed which produced the following worce-case scenario;\n\nA rupture of a 1 ton chlorine cylinder containing liquid chlorine.  It would take 10minutes for the cylinder to completely empty.  Distance to endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\nWe have procedures in place to prevent leaks or mishaps while performing maintenance on equipment or changing cylinders.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program has been perfected to produce the maximum effective impact in the least amount of time.\n\n1. Dial 911\n2. Contact Plant Superintendent of Chief Operator"
