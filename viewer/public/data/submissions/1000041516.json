Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n   a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10      minutes.\n\n   b. The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility has implemented the provisiions of \"Safey Requirements for the Storage & Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Instute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.
