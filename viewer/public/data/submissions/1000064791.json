The properties of this material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal & State of California rules and regulations.  These include EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40CFR Part 68), OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 29CFR 1910.119), California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP, 19 CCR 2735-2785), and Cal / OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 8CCR 5189) as well as regulations referenced by these or incorporated because of the nature of the chemical.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle the ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics is a wholesale food distribution warehouse.  It stores bare root trees, and plants, frozen food products for fast food chains and microwave meals and other products in over 3 million cubic feet of current storage space with the capacity of storing in excess of 30 million pounds of products in spaces from -20 degrees to 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in two (2) refrigeration systems at the warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia at the site is completely contained within two (2) closed loop refrigeration systems at all times.

They have not been included in the executive summary at the direction of the EPA due to homeland security considerations.\r\n\r\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The hazardous materials management and safety programs implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nOur facility keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation on the ammonia process at the California Cold Logistics facility. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia process so they can operate and maintain the refrigeration system in a safe efficient manner. A copy of the PSI is available for review to all employees who work on or near the ammonia process equipment.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If and/or Hazop. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nWritten procedures are in place at California Cold Logistics to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.

Release number one of 95.3 lbs. in 2 hours occurred January 31, 2014 and was due to human error when performing manual defrost of an evaporator unit. The fire department called for shelter in place of local residents. The release triggered three separate calls related to a resultant relief valve failure to re-seat. No on-site or offsite injuries or deaths resulted from the release. Release number two of 29.3 lbs. in 8 hours occurred February 1, 2014 and was due to a union leak in a PRV vent line.  An $260,000 loss of stored product occurred. No on-site or offsite injuries or deaths resulted from the release.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for each of these releases extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source. \r\n\r\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nCalifornia Cold Logistics is a non-responding facility.  The Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Yuba City Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if needed.
