In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals icluding any use, storage,  handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.\n\nAny group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThe refrigeration reqired is provided by mechanical equipment which uses anhydrous ammonia as the thermodynamic working fluid in a closed circulatory system.  Ammonia has been the principal working fluid for mechanical refrigeration systems for the food processing industry.  The total refrigeration capacity installed in the facility is approximately 45,600 pounds of ammonia.\n\nThe plants process entails processing of raw meat products in such a way as to pre"

Meat products require refrigeration and freezing to preserve the products against spoilage during manufacturing, transportation and in retail stores.\n\nThe worst case scenario would involve a forklift striking a storage vessel causing a puncture or other related damage.  This would cause a high prressure liquid release of approximately 4440 pounds of ammonia resulting in a ten minute release.  Under the worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel .8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer  pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst case weather conditions are uncommon; procedures are in place to prevent unauthorized entry of forklifts; safety procedures are in effect to address the safe operation of equipment in this location; training is conducted to all forklift operators to insure safe-operating procedures and as needed to insure employee  awareness.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would involve failure of a transfer hose during unloading resulting in a release of 8,000 pounds over a time period of 33.0 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel .10 of a mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose  a hazard to the public.  Transer hose failure was chosen as the alterntive release scenario because it is a temporary connection and constructed of materials other than steel.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: emergency equipment such as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves to isolate the transfer hose; the vessel has automatic shut offs; the facility accident prevention program in place at the facility including operating procedures to have personnel present at all times during unloading, and the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventi"

Training procedures are in place to insure that all maintenance employees responsible for maintaining the system receive recertification training every 3 years and any new employees receive training before conducting operations on the ammonia system.\n\nControls and equipment go through an intense check list to insure safe operation of the equipment by qualified maintenance engineers on a daily basis.  The system is maintained 24 hours a day 7 days a week by qualified maintenance engineers.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan utilized is OSHA's Regulation 29 CFR 1910.38.  This plan is in place for the safe evacuation of employees.  Training is given to all affected employees annually and before their duty assignment begins.  Evacuation exercises are conducted as needed to promote training and additional understanding of the program.\n\nThe emergency response team is designated to the Oklahoma City Fire Department.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department participates in the overall program and coordinates with management in areas of planning for emergencies and emergency operations.\n\nUnder the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) and under Section 303 of EPCRA, local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) must prepare an emergency response plan for facilities in their planning district having toxic substances listed under EPCRA Section 302 in excess of the threshold planning quantity established under that section.\n\nThe Oklahoma City LEPC has been furished a copy of this company's \"Emergency Action Plan\".
