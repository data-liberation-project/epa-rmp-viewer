This emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nThe Trico Products facility is located at 1995 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas.  The sintering furnace operation utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its process.  This process chemical, the regulated substance handled, is stored in a single horizontal tank located on the northwest side of the property.  The tank has a manual shutoff valve in case of an emergency.  Additionally, the ammonia feeding system is equipped with both manual E-stops and automatic shut-off valves.  The facility is manned 24-hours a day and the tank has a fence perimeter to prevent entry from un-authorized personnel.  The anhydrous ammonia process is checked routinely throughout the day.  Self-contained-breathing-apparatus (SCBA) are stored strategically throughout the facility.\n\nThe Trico Products accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements.\n\n- Strong adherence to Process Safety Management;\n- High level of training of the operators;\n- Preventive maintenance program;\n- Use of process and safety equiptment;\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures;\n- Performance of a hazard review assessment of equiptment and procedures; and\n- Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained-breathing-apparatus, Level B protective clothing, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred in the past five years.\n\nThe faci"
