If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify Mulvane Emergency Services and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a grain elevator and farm supply business which also retails propane.  Our propane system consists of two 8,000 gallon storage tanks, one 1000 gallon storage tank, one 500 gallon storage tank and one 2600 gallon tank mounted on a truck used for delivery, and related piping, pumps and valves.\n\nThe worst case scenario: Our worst case scenario is a failure of our two 8,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees F) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's lookup tables, the distance to endpoint is 0.3 miles.  There are two private homes, a public golf course, and a Day Care Center within that distance of 0.3 miles.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive year accident history: We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify Sedgwick County Emergency Services and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with them and members of the department have inspected our propane system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None"
