The plan and related program documents help to meet federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, that apply to the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage & Supply (AASS) System.  PPES is operated by NAES Corporation (NAES) for the owners listed below.\nA?    Plum Point Energy Associates, LLC\nA?    East Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc.\nA?    Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission\nA?    The Empire District Electric Company\nA?    Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi\nThe PPES is located at 2732 South County Road 623, Osceola, AR  72370.\nThe RMP outlines the management system and procedures taken to prevent and mitigate accidental releases from the Anhydrous Ammonia Supply System (AASS) in order to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of potential releases.\n1.2    PLANT PROCESS INFORMATION\nPPES consists of one Powder River Basin (PRB) coal -fired boiler, which will produce a gross electric power output of 723 megawatts (MW).  Principle process equipment includes the boiler, steam turbine, air pollution control systems, fuel handling systems, AASS system, and a cooling tower.\nThe Emission Control System (ECS) include the following equipment:\nA?    Dry Lime Slurry Scrubber System for Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) control\nA?    Anhydrous Ammonia Injection for Nitrous Oxides (NOX) control\nA?    Carbon injection for Mercury reduction\nA?    Baghouse for Particulate Matter control\nA?    Ash disposal in PPES  industrial landfill\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used as the NOx reduction reagent. A 12,750-gallon working capacity anhydrous ammonia storage tank has been constructed is at the site. Additional project components include a power distribution center, continuous emission monitoring system, fuel handling and ash processing systems."

Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP.  A management system has been developed with clearly defined accountability and responsibility for the Risk Management Program.\nTo help ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, PPES maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\nA?    Ammonia gas detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems; \nA?    Process Safety Information to document the safe process design; \nA?    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to evaluate the chemical and process hazards; \nA?    Operating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely, \nA?    Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing to ensure that the system is properly maintained; \nA?    Safe Work Practices to ensure that employees working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely, and know the actions to be taken in an emergency; \nA?    Incident Investigation procedure to investigate incidents and \"near misses\" to determine root causes and make needed safety improvements; and, \nA?    Compliance Audits to periodically verify that our programs are working as they should.\n1.5    Five Year Accident History\nPPES is currently under construction and anhydrous ammonia will be delivered in February 2010. \n1.6    Emergency Response Program\nIn the event that an anhydrous ammonia release does occur, PPES has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency"

Additionally, the plant has emergency operations procedures in place detailing appropriate emergency actions to help mitigate the effects of any release.\n1.7    Maintaining a Safe Operation\nPPES will continually work to safely manage the hazards of anhydrous ammonia to protect the community we serve and the employees working for us. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases through training, procedures, equipment maintenance, and safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our PHA, coordinate with the community emergency response organization, and will update our program as needed to assure safe and efficient control and management of the AASS system.\n&#8195;\n"
