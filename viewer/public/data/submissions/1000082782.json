      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - TORNADO GAS PLANT \n\n\n\nMarkWest Tornado GP, L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Tornado Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe Tornado Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system. Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates condensate from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, dehydrated to remove any water, and is then sent to an expander where the temperature is reduced. Ethane and heavier liquids are separated from the methane gas stream. The liquids are then stabilized using a de-methanizer to remove any methane entrained. The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline and the natural gas liquids (NGLs) are pumped into a product pipeline for sales. Condensate is stored in tanks and trucked out of the facility. \n\n\n\nThe products at the Tornado Gas Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\n\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release"

The worst case and alternative case radii to endpoint were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In evaluating the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios there were no administrative controls or mitigation measures taken into account to reduce potential off-site impact. Populations within each radius were determined using the Missouri Census Data Center.\n\n\n\nSeveral vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. This summary addresses each of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program since the process at the facility that is regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation is also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specificall"

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA). HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

Ultimately, these reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits \n\n\n\nTo help ensure compliance with the RMP, MarkWest periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited. One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered. The Plant will maintain a listing of non-conformances identified during an audit and document closure of compliance audit action items. The two most recent audit reports will remain on file with the documentation of closed items.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation \n\n\n\nMarkWest promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\n\n\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, startup after a turn around, and initial startup of a new process.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Tornado Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The PSSR confirm that"

The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident. The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nMarkWest encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team. Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit \n\n\n\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.

Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nMarkWest has long-standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, Industrial Standards, and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\n\n\n\nContractors \n\n\n\nThe Tornado Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased or specialized maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Tornado Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nThe processes at the Tornado Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
