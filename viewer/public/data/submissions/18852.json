      "SummaryText": "Accidental release and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Elkem Metals Company (Elkem) facility in Marietta, Ohio utilizes anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2) and anhydrous ammonia (NH3) in the electrolytic manufacture of ferrochrome and ferromanganese alloys.  Because SO2 and NH3 are listed compounds by the Occupations Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the control of these compounds in the production areas is regulated by these two agencies. \n\nIn order to comply with the regulatory requirements, and to protect the health and safety of their employees, the surrounding community, and the environment, Elkem has established a risk management program to help ensure the contined safe operation of its day-to-day processes and operations.\n\nPrimary activities, use of regulated substances, and quantities used:\n\nEach manufacturing process (ElChrome and ElMang) has its own NH3 and SO2 storage tanks.  At each process, there is one tank that stores 76,000 lb of SO2.  The ElMang process has two NH3 tanks, each with a 93,000 lb capacity.  The ElChrome process has one 93,000 lb NH3 storage tank.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case potential release from the system would involve one SO2 tank.  Based upon the RMP regulatory definition of such a release, it was assumed that all the material in the tank would be released to the environment within 10 minutes.  Such an unlikely release could have the potential to affect personnel within a 19.76 mile radius of the release site.  This area includes the residences of approximately 159,000 people, schools, recreation areas, hospitals, other industrial facilities, and the Ohio River.  However, this is an extremely unlikely situation.  The tanks are inspected routinely by Elkem personnel for damage.  They are equipped with relief valves that would relieve the pressure in the tank if it became excessive, thereby preventing the rupture of the tank and the release of all the material in the"

      "SummaryText": " tank.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nAn alternative release scenario would be a hole in a vessel, rather than a vessel rupture, or a pipe break or hole in a pipe.  For a hole in an ammonia vessel, receptors within 0.3 miles may be affected.  This area includes the residences of approximately 41 people, a recreation area, other industrial facilities, and the Ohio River.  For a hole in a sulfur dioxide vessel, receptors within 1.8 miles may be affected.  This includes the residences of approximately 2,300 people, recreation areas, other industrial facilities, and the Ohio River.\n\nGeneral accident release prevention:\n\nElkem has established a management system intended to meet the requirements of both the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards to help ensure the safe operation of these processes.  To identify situations that have the potential to result in anhydrous ammonia or sulfur dioxide releases, Elkem analyzed the processes, looking at how process elements interact, how the equipment might fail, practices that are in place to prevent failures, practices that are in place to react to failures, and what, if any, improvements need to be made.  In addition, Elkem has established facility-wide procedures to manage hazardous activities, such as welding, and process-specific procedures to address the hazards and operations and maintenance activities that are unique to the NH3 and SO2 processes.  All personnel who may be required to perform these activities are trained in the proper procedures.  Employees have been asked to participate in the developed of the procedures and other relevant documentation related to the process so their experience and knowledge can be utilized.  New equipment is inspected and tested before it is placed in service, and all changes are analyzed before they are implemented to ensure they do not create new hazards.\n\nAccident history and emergency response program:\n\nSince the covered processes were installed in 1954, they have operated without a major "
