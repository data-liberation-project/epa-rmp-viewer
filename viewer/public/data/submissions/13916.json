This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of all hazardous substances.  However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel are ready to respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe BP Amoco Chemical Pasadena Plant is located at 1500 North South Street in Pasadena Texas, 77501.  The facility produces linear alpha olefins and industrial grade alcohols using ethylene as the major feed stock in the two process operations.  Both of these processes have been in service for over 20 years and are closely interconnected and dependent on each other for efficient operation.  The processes start with ethylene under relatively high pressure and react it with an aluminum alkyl to form different aluminum alkyls containing long, straight hydrocarbon branches.  A number of subsequent steps remove and then separate the resulting long chain hydrocarbons into distinct alcohols and linear alpha olefin products.  These materials are primarily sold to other manufacturers for use in their production processes and shipped by either truck, rail or barge.\n\nOur processes use the following chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities specified in EPAs Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation:\n\nToxics\n\n7 Titanium Tetrachloride, which is used to improve alcohol yield.  We can store up to 84,500 lbs."

We can store over one million gallons of this material on site.\n\n7 Ethylene, which is the main feed stock to our processes.  Ethylene is supplied by pipeline at a rate of about 2,000 lbs/min.\n\nOur comprehensive operations and maintenance procedures, accidental release prevention activities and contingency planning efforts allow us to effectively manage the hazards that these materials pose to our employees, the public, and the environment.  This has been demonstrated by our past performance, 20 years of ongoing operations without a serious incident with off site impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nProvided below are brief summaries of the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios, developed in accordance with the RMP rule.  Also included is information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures in place to limit the impact distances for each scenario.\n\nToxic Release  Scenario -Iron Pentacarbonyl\n\nThis worst case scenario assumes that the iron pentacarbonyl storage tank is full and ruptures spilling its entire contents of 4,440 lbs. into the existing containment area.  (For this to occur, it must be assumed that the storage drums safety relief valve does not work).  This scenario further assumes that operations personnel, who would normally be alerted to a possible release by an existing CO monitor, fail to take any remedial actions such as putting water on the spilled material.  These assumptions result in a hypothetical release that has impacts that extend off site and could reach near by residential communities.\n\nAlternate Toxic Release Scenarios-Iron Pentacarbonyl/Titanium Tetrachloride\n\nFor both of these chemicals, unlike in the worst case scenario, a significant release is mo"

For iron pentacarbonyl, the alternate scenario would have a release occur while unloading an iron pentacarbonyl cylinder into its storage drum.  It assumes that the 1\" diameter unloading hose develops a leak.  This scenario is based on the operator, who is standing by while the cylinder is being unloaded, taking corrective actions such as immediately blocking in the leaking.  Based on a theoretical 100 lb. leak the EPA model indicated potential impacts could include one of our industrial neighbors.\n\nFor titanium tetrachloride, a release is also most likely to occur while unloading a trailer into its storage tank.  A leak in the 2\" diameter unloading line could result in a 1,000 lb. release.  The operator standing-by during the unloading is assumed to immediately block in the release and spray water on the spill.  The calculate impact zone for this hypothetical release could include one of our industrial neighbors but not the general public.\n\n\nWorst-case Flammable Release Scenario -Butene\n\nButene is produced on site and is stored at several locations in the plant.  The worst case scenario assumes that the plants largest storage vessel is completely full and ruptures, instantly spilling its entire contents of 433,000 gallons.  This scenario then assumes that all of the spilled material ignites resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  For this scenario to occur, requires the assumption that the storage vessels safety relief valves fail to work and that there is no pooling of liquid in the diked area around the vessel.  The theoretical impact zone for this case would include our industrial neighbors.\n\n\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario - Ethylene\n\nA more reasonable alternate scenario for a flammable release would be a leak in the 6\" ethylene supply line to the plant.  (Ethylene is the primary raw material for our production processes.)  Such a leak could release 100,000"

Examples of employee participation range from compiling and updating technical information and operating procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis teams.

We primarily use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.\n\nThese studies are conducted using teams of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  These teams identify and evaluate hazards of the process, as well as accidents prevention and mitigation measures, and make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  At least every five years, the plant updates and revalidates these hazard analysis results.  Recommendations from these studies are sent to management for evaluation and implementation.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown.  These procedures are developed and periodically revised by experienced operators, as needed.  Such procedures not only aid in consistent day-to-day operation but also provide a basis for consistent training of new operations personnel.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Pasadena Chemical plant has well-established practices and procedures in place to properly maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, monitoring and control systems, pumps, compressors and all other critical equipment.
