This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Devon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nBasis for Plant\r\n\r\nThe primary reasons the plants exist are to condition the gas to make marketable. The inlet gas produced in the field is categorized two ways; rich and lean. The \"lean\" gas, which is typically 1050 BTU or less, can be marketed as long as it is dry. This can be accomplished by glycol dehydration at the field. The \"rich\" however is higher in BTU content which means it has heavy hydrocarbon liquids that need extracted to meet market specification. The inlet gas at the Bridgeport Plant is approximately 1170 BTU so processing is required. \r\n\r\nPrior to removal of the heavy hydrocarbon liquids the plants perform other gas conditioning tasks. They remove any free water and condensate through front end separation; remove CO2 through amine treating, and glycol and mole sieve dehydration to dry gas.\r\n\r\nBridgeport Plant\r\n\r\nThe Bridgeport Plant is designed to process 790 MMscf/d of raw natural gas as well as a blended bypass of 100 MMscf/d for a total throughput capacity of 890 MMcf/d. Currently, the Bridgeport plant is averaging approximately 680-700 MMscf/d of gas and 50,000 - 60,000 Bbls/d of product.  The processing of the natural gas is made possible through seven Cryogenic trains. \r\n1)\t- #1 Plant 170 MMSCF/D\r\n2)\t- #2 Plant 15 MMSCF/D\r\n3)\t- #3 Plant 15 MMSCF/D\r\n4)\t- #4 Plant 1"

This is accomplished with 3 molecular sieve beds at each plant #1, #2 and  #3, #4, #5, #6 and #7, two in dehy and one in regen.  The #1 plant utilizes a 12 gpm glycol unit in series with 6 molecular sieve beds. \r\n\r\nThe dehydrated raw natural gas then enters the cold sections of the cryogenic plants. Through a process of cross exchange and running through an expander the cryogenic temperatures allow the heavier components to be extracted as a liquid. As a result the raw natural gas is converted into a residue gas stream and a y-grade liquid (ethane plus).\r\n\r\n\r\nAMINE UNITS COMPLEXITY\r\n\r\nAll of the amine treaters with the exception of the #1 and #2 amine treaters are used to treat multiple plants.

Failure to do could result in a total plant shut down within minutes. The knowledge and expertise it takes to accomplish this and keep all the plants on is substantial. But just as important as the Treaters are so are the plants themselves as well as the Horsepower it takes to move the gas thru the plants. Any loss of a plant or horsepower requires numerous changes to be made to prevent a Domino effect caused by high or low pressures that will shut down engines or even an inlet valve to a plant. The knowledge required to operate the multiple plants at Bridgeport is highly respected and takes years to acquire. \r\n\r\nRTO  UNITS\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of the CO2 from the gas stream the acid gas must be disposed of. We accomplish this thru the use of (2) Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers. This equipment uses entrained methane in the acid gas to help fuel the incineration process of the CO2. \r\n\r\nThis unit requires diligent attention; any shut down of this equipment requires immediate action. All releases of acid gas to the atmosphere must be recorded. If release is over 10lbs of Benzene it must be reported to TCEQ within 48 hrs. \r\n\r\nT.O. UNITS\r\n\r\nThe Thermal Oxidizer units at the Bridgeport Plant are backup for the RTO units. These units must be put online anytime the RTO goes down.

The Y-grade product which is removed from the inlet gas stream at each plant is accumulated in the product surge and is then pumped to fractionation for further refinement or to Chevron Pipeline & Oneok Pipeline. We currently pipeline approximately 47,570 bbl/d including ethane from deethanizer to Chevron & Oneok, and produce approximately 7,600 bbl/d of finished products (Propane, Butane, Iso-Butane, and Natural Gasoline) through fractionation.  \r\n\r\nTANK FARM\r\n\r\nThe tank farm at the Bridgeport Plant is used to store the finished product before sales. These tanks are manually gauged twice a day for accuracy. The plant operators also manually switch each tank as it is made up. We keep up inventory in case we need to pipeline some of the product to maintain adequate room. Monitoring these levels is critical to plant operations. Finished product storage capacity is approximately 1.8 million gallons with the largest being propane and natural gasoline. Inventory is tracked, and reported through plant reports and historian data base. Reports utilized are the \"Fractionated Products Log\" that operations manage, the \"Production Daily Report Summary\" which monitors balance, and \"Bridgeport Daily Numbers\" sent to marketing.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Bridgeport Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Bridgeport Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Bridgeport Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
