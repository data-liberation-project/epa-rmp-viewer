      "SummaryText": "Our facility has one 8000 gallon storage tank, one 12000 gallon storage tank and equipment for receiving ammonia from truck transports.  This equipment can also transfer ammonia from storage to nurse tanks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet or exceed all local, state and national standards relating to storing and transfering ammonia.  Although ammonia is a toxic material, records at this facility show that we have never had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.  Specific safety features that we employ to minimize damage from any unusual occurrences include:  1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.  2. Pressure relief valves on each tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tanks.  To further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained and periodically retrained, in procedures that are in accordance with current ammonia storage and transferring regulations.  In addition, we have coordinated with the Earth Volunteer Fire Department to respond to emergencies.  As required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA.  This scenario involves a vapor cloud release of the entire contents of the 12000 gallon tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 4.18 miles from our facility.  It is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA's worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event would be and event like a hose break caused by a pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the impact from such a release would only extend .38 miles and would not impact any schools, hospitals or parks."
