This comprehensive program has been developed to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the regulation.

The facility lies approximately 500 yards west of State Highway 99 and 500 yards north of State Highway 120 near the intersection of the two highways.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of light industrial facilities, commercial and office areas, some agricultural lands, and residential areas.  See Figure 1 for the Site Location Map of this facility.\n\nThis facility stores ice cream products for distribution under approximately 98,000 square feet of total warehouse space, with approximately 70,000 square feet of refrigerated space.  The remaining areas include office areas, the control room, and the engine room.  There is no manufacturing at this facility.  See Figure 2 for the Facility Map.\n\nThe distribution center employs approximately 60 people and the refrigeration system operates 24 hours per day.\n \nProcess Description\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a heat transfer fluid in the plant refrigeration system.  The system is a single-stage, multi-suction, economized mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes recirculated liquid feed to evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for the 10A?F Shipping Dock and for the -20A?F freezer.  The system charge is approximately 13,000 lbs.\n\nOne high-temperature screw compressor provides suction and compression for the high temperature cooling, while two low-temperature screw compressors serve the low-temperature cooling requirements.  A swing screw compressor can back-up either the high-temperature or low-temperature requirements as needed.\n\nThe heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporative condenser.  The condenser drains high-pressure liquid to the thermosiphon / high-"

An autodialer initiates a call list, including the refrigeration contractor technician, in the event of system operating deviations.  All personnel are trained in the proper emergency response procedures, specifically the procedures called out in the site Emergency Action Plan for response to ammonia releases.  The Plan includes notification and evacuation protocols.\n\nThere is an oil pot at each recirculator and each oil pot vessel is equipped with a self-closing spring-loaded drain valve for safety.  All pressure vessels in the system have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's relieve to an ammonia diffusion tank via a common discharge piping system.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain an efficient refrigeration process.\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof, while the freezer evaporators are located in rooftop penthouse units above the freezer and the dock evaporators are suspended from bar joists inside the dock area.  The evaporator coils are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe release prevention elements included in the CalARP Program Manual provide the critical elements for preventing accidental releases.  Anhydrous ammonia is present in the refrigeration system above the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. and is, therefore, subject to the OSHA PSM Standard.  The PSM Standard elements have been adopted to satisfy the Program 3 release prevention steps for anhydrous ammonia.  Specifically, the elements of the release prevention program are:\n\n1.

The emergency response measures primarily include the safe evacuation of all personnel and notification to outside emergency responders.  Incidental releases that do not pose an imminent safety hazard may be abated by contractor employees who are trained to provide such a response, are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and are authorized by Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream to perform such activities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nModifications to this system are implemented through the Management of Change, as a result of Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, Compliance Audit findings, Incident Investigations, regulatory audits, and self-discovery.  Deficiencies are scheduled for correction and completed in a timely manner.\n\nCurrent plans to improve safety include:\n\n1.    Additional and modified Standard Operating Procedures\n2.    Minor improvements for labeling of equipment, valves, and piping\n3.    Valve lockout and tagging modifications\n4.    Improved equipment access for maintenance activities\n5.
