      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nTOWN BRANCH WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan for Town Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant has been prepared in accordance with EPA \"Risk Management\"  and is designed specifically for the above specified location.  Town Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in Lexington, Kentucky, 301 Lisle Industrial Avenue and is operated by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government- Division of Sanitary Sewers.  The probability of a release at this facility is classified as low to medium.  The new chlorine storage building with a full scrubbing facility should prevent any major release from leaving the area.  Should a leak of a chlorine cylinder or sulfur dioxide cylinder occur, the onsite personnel (LFUCG employees) and surrounding population would be immediately vulnerable to exposure.  In the event of a release, there may be possible human health impacts to on-site employees.  A residential area to the North as well as property and the environment would be affected.  Contamination near the facility is possible.  A worst case release could affect an area over 3.3 mile radius and impact a sizeable residential and institutional population.  The Lexington Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) Division of Sanitary Sewers has invested ample and considerable time in devising and implementing accidental release prevention programs and emergency response policies.\n\nTown Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant applies a holistic and proactive approach towards risk management. The LFUCG has devised a reliable maintenance program, identifying management policies, preventive maintenance practices and plans and procedures to identify and minimize risk at the plant. Preventive maintenance consists of daily and weekly checks of plant equipment.  All equipment is loaded on a data base maintained by the LFUCG.  A data sheet is printed out daily indicating the maintenance and check schedule of all equipment and procedures.\n\nThe LFUCG manages risk "

Management and employees of the LFUCG reduce  risk by conducting manual inspections and routine maintenance checks.   The LFUCG identifies, evaluates, and analyzes potential risk situations in order to minimize a potential hazardous event at the plant.\n\nIn the unlikely event that a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak would occur, LFUCG employees, and the Local Ememergency Planning Committee are well prepared and trained to remediate and or mitigate the situation.  LFUCG employees are trained in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  They are also trained on initial startup procedures, normal operating procedures, temporary operating procedures, emergency operating procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, normal shutdown procedures, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown procedure.\n\nThe regulated substances at the Town Branch facility are chlorine and anhydrous sulfur dioxide. Worst case and alternative release scenarios were developed for both of these regulated chemicals in order to determine the impact it would have on the immediate community.  The risk analysis for both was modeled with EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The results for this modeling is described below, however, it should be noted that the likelihood of leaks of this size and nature occurring are absolute worst scenarios and are not likely to occur.  The Town Branch WWTP has invested millions of dollars to ensure the proper precautionary systems and equipment were installed to protect against leaks of a worst case magnitude.  These precautionary measures are best exemplified in the alternative release scenarios for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide and will be described later.\n\nThe worst case scenario for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide was modeled to determine offsite consequence analysis.

The only passive mitigation at Town Branch applicable for these scenarios was enclosure of the toxic gases in the building.  \n\nThe largest quantity of both chemicals was determined by taking into account administrative controls rather than absolute capacity of the pipes.  Town Branch uses administrative controls that limit the quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that can be stored in a pipe at any one time. \n\nThe toxic worst case release for chlorine via a pipe leak at Town Branch, using only passive mitigation measures is 8,000 lbs with a release rate of 440 lbs/min.  The duration of the release is 10 minutes with wind speed calculated at 1.5 m/sec.  Considering these factors, the maximum effected radius or distance to the endpoint is calculated at 2 miles (based on EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables for Chlorine Gas).  Within this 2 mile radius, approximately 66,000 people could potentially be effected.  Residences, schools, hospitals, and recreation areas are all within this specified area and could potentially be affected.\n\nThe toxic worst case release for anhydrous sulfur dioxide via a pipe leak, using passive mitigation measures is 4,000 lbs with a release rate of 220 lbs/min.  The duration of the release is 10 minutes with wind speed calculated at 1.5 m/sec.

Modeling for the alternative releases was based on EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations for gas pipe leaks.\n\nThe maximum quantity release for chlorine at Town Branch through a pipe leak, using passive and active mitigation measures is 6 lbs with a release rate of 0.1 lbs/min.

Considering these factors the realistic distance to an endpoint or offsite analysis is actually 0.10 mile with only 19 people affected.  The number is significantly reduced from the worst case scenario due to the active mitigation measures in place at the facility.  The scrubbing facility at Town Branch operates at 99% efficiency and is devised to remediate any chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak in the building.  The scrubbing process is further described below.\n\nThe maximum quantity release for sulfur dioxide at Town Branch using passive and active mitigation measures is 6 lbs with a release rate of 0.1 lbs/min.

In the event of a chlorine leak in the feed room, or the tank storage room, the following systems would be activated.  If a leak detector detects chlorine gas, the ventilation systems and the alarm systems will be activated.  The alarm system consists of both an audible and a visual alarm in the building.  There will also be a visual alarm and audible alarm outside the building. An alarm is also on the main computer systems, so if an operator is in the computer room he will see and hear the alarm.  When the leak detectors are activated, they will cause the ventilation systems to shut down.  Following the shut down of the ventilation system, the scrubber system is immediately automatically activated.  This system will remove the contaminated air from the feed or storage room via intake piping.  Chlorine gas will settle to the lower portions of the room, where the air intake piping is located, allowing it to be picked up and pulled into the caustic tank room where it is passed through the caustic solution.  This solution neutralizes the chlorine gas that is in the air and returns the scrubbed air back into the chlorine tank storage room and feed room.\n\nThe ventilation systems which are associated with the chlorine tank storage room are checked every 30 days for operational condition.  The louvers and vents are manually activated for verification of operation and then inspected.  The leak detection systems are also checked, calibrated and verified for operation every thirty days.

If a leak detector has a weak cell or a bad battery, these two scenarios will activate the alarm system.  Upon investigating the alarm, the operator can determine whether it is a true leak or a malfunction of the system using a portable gas monitor.  If it is determined that the leak detector has malfunctioned, the system does have the ability to lock that particular unit out of the sequence.  This does not disarm the other five units that are in place.  The likelihood of having all six malfunction is remote.\n\nIf for some reason, the caustic scrubber pump would not run automatically, there is a manual override available to kick the pump in.  If the caustic pump will not run automatically or manually and it has been verified by using portable leak detectors that there is a leak of such magnitude that it cannot be handled by plant personnel, an emergency call will be initiated to the Division of Fire and to DEEM to request assistance with the leak.\n\nOperations and procedures are very similar for sulfur dioxide.
