Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia  which is considered hazardous by EPA. We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the ANSI K-61.1 standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Van Buren Township Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and,  has  instructed employees on  procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThis facility is a 12 acre complex bordered on 3 sides by houses and/or businesses.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed as a fertilizer to f"

The maximum capacity of the largest  tank 117,832 lbs. \n\nThis   facility has equipment for unloading truck   transports and equipment to load nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, and authorized contractors. \n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nProduct: anhydrous ammonia\n     Worst case Scenario: The worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released as a gas over 10 minutes from a  26,000 gallon storage tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 1.07 miles from the tank. Due to the location of the tanks in relation to the population of Star City there would be an impact on the surrounding area in case of a release.\n\n      As an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure of a 2 inch hose during product transfer operations, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .56 miles from the tank.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia released would be 11,908 pounds. \n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility's  anhydrous ammonia plant has  implemented portions of  the ANSI K-61.1 standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; periodic inspections by the Indiana State Chemists Office are also conducted. Employees involved in anhydrous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by our Safety Coordinator, contr"

      "SummaryText": "actor and insurance companies, and industry experts; an annual formal refresher course as well as periodic training is also provided.  \n  The major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, stress corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \n  Mitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would \"knock down\" the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia. In addition,  passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 88% capacity (through tank gauges and onsite personnel) are utilized.\n  Employees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis. Employee Training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs. Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\n   Maintenance programs are in place. Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date,  or if a system or process is changed or upgraded. OSHA 1910.111 standards are used to identify those needs. The Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation). In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a nearly daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.\n\n5. Five-year accident history. \n\nWe have had no accidental release of  anhydrous ammonia from this facility the last 5 years.\n\n6.
