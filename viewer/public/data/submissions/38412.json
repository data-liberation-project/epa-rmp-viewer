The endpoint represents the distance at which a released substance must\n\ntravel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\n\n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\n\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\n\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\n\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\n\nrelease is simply assumed to take place and the greatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly\n\nreleased.  The results of the worst case scenario analysis were as follows:\n\n\n\n          Toxic Substances: The formaldehyde storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently\n\n     produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents.  The release was assumed to\n\n     evaporate over a 10-minute time period. Since the tank is enclosed by a building and\n\n     diked, these passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the release impacts. \n\n     The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be less than 0.06 miles. The release\n\n     rate according to OCA Guidance was calculated to be 0.012 pounds per minute. \n\n     However, a release rate of 0.2 pounds per minute was entered into the RMP Submit\n\n     document since this is the lowest value that can be entered int"

No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the\n\n     release impacts.  The distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than\n\n     0.23 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect public\n\nreceptors.  For formaldehyde the release was assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or\n\nrupture of a  transfer hose during unloading operations.  For flammable materials, the alternative\n\nrelease scenario assumed that dimethylamine was released as a result of the uncoupling or\n\nrupture of a hose during unloading operations. The durations for releasing these materials from a\n\nvessel/pipe for the alternative release scenarios were assumed to occur over a 45-second time\n\nperiod since the unloading operations are supervised.  With the exception of considering that\n\nthese transfer operations are monitored by personnel at all times, no other mitigating controls\n\nwere assumed to limit the releases. The results of the alternative release scenario analysis were as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n          Toxic Substances:\n\n                    Formaldehyde, 37 percent - 0.06 miles\n\n                    \n\n          Flammable Substance:\n\n                    Dimethylamine - 0.06 miles\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\n\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with\n\nchemical specific prevention steps have been developed.
