A primary aspect of this commitment is the Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant established a management system to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine wou"

Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHAs, Greer Commission of Public Works Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques.
