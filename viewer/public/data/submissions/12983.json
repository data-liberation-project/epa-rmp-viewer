It is United Dairymen's policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.\n\nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for United Dairymen and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nUnited Dairymen owns and operates a fluid milk processing facility located at 2008 South Hardy Drive in Tempe, Arizona.  At United Dairymen, anhydrous ammonia is utilized as the refrigerant in two refrigeration systems.  These refrigeration systems supply process cooling for the ice makers and for the plate and frame heat exchangers for the chilled water and chilled glycol systems.  \n\nThe system which services the ice makers consists of two ammonia receivers, evaporative condensers, a screw compressor and oil cooler, reciprocating compressors, and suction accumulators.  The major components of the second refrigeration system are an ammonia receiver, an evaporative condenser, a compressor and oil cooler, and a thermosyphon vessel. \n\nDuring normal operations, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout each refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities on either system, the system being worked on can be \"pumped down\" to evacuate the ammonia from the system and stored the ammonia as a liquid in the receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest receiver is 7,400 pounds.   \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This concentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the max"

The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary source to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must analyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  Since United Dairymen's ammonia-based refrigeration systems are considered a Program 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential population within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  This area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the release would travel with concentrations at or above the endpoint.  The circle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be identified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the contents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied gases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are assumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  However, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency response agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  For United Dairymen, the alternative release scenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia-"

A release while draining oil from the ice banks or the suction accumulators was identified in the PHAs as the credible release event having a release rate high enough to cause an offsite impact, and therefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.    \n\nUnited Dairymen has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the release of approximately 7,400 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period, the plume would travel 1.0 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  Sensitive receptor information is provided in RMP*Submit.  Using 1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the worst-case release scenario circle is 12,000 people.  There are no environmental receptors within the worst case release scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, the oil drain release was modeled as a release of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  For a release of 74 lb/min of anhydrous ammonia, the model calculated that the plume would travel 0.1 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  The alternative release scenario circle includes the nearby industrial facilities, commercial businesses, and roadways.\n\nBased on observations of the area, there are no residences or sensitive receptors within 0.1 mile of the facility.  Therefore, there would be no population impacts due to the alternative release scenario.  Also, based on a review of the U.S.G.S. maps, there are no environmentally sensitive receptors that would be affected by the alternative release scenario from the United Dairymen facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at United Dairymen to address the"

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since United Dairymen employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nBased on the PHAs performed in June, 1999, no changes were recommended.\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, United Dairymen regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently, United Dairymen does not have any additional changes planned to improve safety."
