      "SummaryText": "The City of Bartlesville operates a water treatment plant located within the City limits in the northwest portion of the City. The plant uses chlorine to treat the City's drinking water. The water treatment plant holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The maximum inventory is nine tons and the treatment plant limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to two. The plant has a chlorine scrubber as an active mitigation measure to capture and neutralize gas leaks.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for the City of Bartlesville Water Plant is the release of a 1-ton cylinder resulting in a downwind distance to the toxic end point (ERPG-2) of 2.6 miles using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. The first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] from the cylinder to the header pipe. This assumed a release of 1,093 pounds and results in a downwind distance to the toxic end point (ERPG-2) of 2.4 miles. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. The second alternate scenario is a release representative of a culmination of both of the previous scenarios. This could occur if a tank ruptured and other tanks were able, due to failure of controls, to flow back along the header pipe and out the broken transfer hose [whip]. This could result in the release of approximately 2,930 pounds of chlorine and result in a downwind distance to the toxic end point (ERPG-2) of\n\n2.9 miles. These hazard assessments will remain the same due to the minimal change in population. Therefore, the hazard assessments from the current RMP will essentially be the previous (2012) RMP.\n\n\n\nThe City of Bartlesville Water Plant follows a strict operation, safety, and maintenance program to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility. This facility has not had a release within the last five years.\n\n\n\nThe City of Bartlesville Water Plant holds training and refresher courses for t"
