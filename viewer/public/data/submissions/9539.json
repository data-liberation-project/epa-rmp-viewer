It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to utilize our own response team and notify the Blanding City Fire Department and enlist their assistance if necessary.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility processes uranium ores.  We use anhydrous ammonia as a reagent in the extraction process.  The process consists of two 140,000 pound tanks and associated valves and piping.\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nOur worst case scenario is the release of all the contents of one 140,000 pound tank when completely full, resulting in a cloud of anhydrous ammonia gas.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site, and public and environmental receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The worst case relase scenario is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, as it requires the use of release parameters achievable only through total and nearly instantaneous tank failure.  Our alternative release scenario is a pressure relief valve stuck open or sheared off, resulting in a 60-minute release of 120,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends slightly beyond the facility fenceline to include a small segment of grazing land, but no public or environmental receptors.  In an effort to comply with the RMP recommendations to model an alternate release that extends off-site we needed to model a very large, and consequently unlikely, alternate release and discount all response and mitigation measures that would normally be taken.  Realistically, alternative releases would likely be minimized by check valves, overfill prevention, excess flow valves and rapid response by trained on-site personnel.  Release mitigation measu"

All of the alternative release scenarios accounting for these measures are contained entirely on-site.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility complies with EPA's Clean Air Act 112(r) RMP requirements and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  Extensive training and inspection of all processes is routinely performed.  The anhydrous ammonia process is designed, installed, operated and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards, ASME standards and ANSI standards.  Tanks and piping are inspected daily.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nWe have never had any accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia process, it is our policy to utilize our own response team and notify the Blanding City Fire Department and enlist their assistance if necessary.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and our own response team and members of the fire department have inspected our facility.  Our emergency response team trains regularly for anhydrous ammonia emergencies.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNo changes are planned at this time.  Our facility is routinely inspected and audited and all changes to improve saftey are implemented as they are noted."
