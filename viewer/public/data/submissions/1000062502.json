There are two (2) engine rooms for the refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating coolers, processing rooms, and freezers at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe total amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 25,800 pounds.  \n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.

The elements of the PSM / RM Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed and updated as of January 2017.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. conducted a thorough PHA study for the refrigeration system during September 2014. \n\n?    Operating Procedures - Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.
