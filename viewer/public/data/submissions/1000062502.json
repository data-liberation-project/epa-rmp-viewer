Ajinomoto Windsor, Inc. is a producer of frozen Italian foods.  \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311412.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) engine rooms for the refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating coolers, processing rooms, and freezers at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe total amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 25,800 pounds.  \r\n\r\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
