Other processing at this facility includes ingredient cherry processing, processing fruits for drying, fruit drying, and finished product packing.  Our mission is to produce quality fruit products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe covered PSM-RMP process for this facility:\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide:  Sulfur Dioxide gas is transferred from either 90 ton railcars or 5 ton cylinders.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm, and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to preserve cherry quality.  To assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon Cherry Growers has a long standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process team members assist in the update of our procedures and safety information.\n\n\n\nTo assure accidental releases are prevented, Oregon Cherry Growers has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide.  All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained, qualified employees.  These include checklists for operations, written operations procedures, regular equipment inspection, and maintaining a comprehensive training program to keep operators alert to safe operations.  Emergency Response activities are reviewed and updated annually.  Emergency response training is included in pre-harvest training activities.\n\n\n\nProcess improvements completed include perimeter monitoring systems and electronic shut offs. Planned improvements include additional coordinated training with local emergency "
