This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety\n\nor environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our\n\nprimary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental\n\nconcerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. \n\nPlant leaders serve as coaches, encouragers, and examples. Yet, in light of our culture, every\n\nperson is considered a Safety Leader. Constant discussion, planning, and training\n\non safety issues will serve to maintain safety awareness and to ensure that a high priority is always\n\nplaced on safety. No job is ever so urgent that safety is jeopardized. Procedures are followed and\n\ntime is taken to plan the best course of action with the least potential for mishap. As situations and\n\nwork requirements change, individual safety awareness must grow to accommodate and address\n\nthese changes.\n\n\n\nLikewise, environmental performance will not be compromised to other priorities. Our people will be\n\nleaders in doing the right thing.  Team planning, awareness, knowledge, and sharing will be our\n\nprimary tools for responsible process operations and accurate reporting.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be so comfortable with our records and procedures that we become\n\npassive. Our goal and attitude will be sustained improvement in keeping safety and environment as\n\npriorities. Our people are very capable of working safely, alert to preventing unsafe or\n\nenvironmentally risky situations, and intend to get better as time goes by.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: The site is approximately\n\n23 acres, with approximately 160,000 square feet under roof.

The facility produces pasteurized milk products for its distributors.\n\nThe facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product\n\ncooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating\n\nflexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency\n\nof operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling\n\nrequired); optimal safety performance; and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic\n\ncontrollers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions\n\nrequire. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other\n\nstorage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility has implemented a\n\nProcess Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and\n\nmaintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly,\n\nprocedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the\n\nmany safety features present at the facility are:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management Program.\n\nEyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n\nPlant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n\nWeekly Safety Meetings.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the\n\nrefrigeration systems during the past five years.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The \"Facility Emergency Action Plan\" has been developed\n\nin accordance w"
