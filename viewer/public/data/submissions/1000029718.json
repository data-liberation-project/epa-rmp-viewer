It is CPI Packaging Inc.'s (CPI's) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, CPI's policy is to notify the City of Lincolnton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility manufactures polyethylene foam.  A 69.20 mole percent isobutane and 30.80 mole percent propane mixture is used in polyethylene foam manufacturing.  The regulated process consists of two isobutane / propane above ground storage tanks (7,933 and 5,000 gallons) and the associated polyethylene foam manufacturing equipment.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  CPI's worst-case scenario is failure of both storage tanks when filled to 90 percent capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. CPI's alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe handling the gas phase, leading to a 60-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  No administrative controls and mitigation measures where used to limit the impacts of the reported scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The isobutane / propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:   CPI h"
