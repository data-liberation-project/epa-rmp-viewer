      "SummaryText": "4.1 Executive Summary\n\nMCAS Cherry Point's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are to maintain safe conditions for base personnel and the inhabitants of the surrounding communities.  This policy is to be enforced through strict compliance with applicable regulations, physical safeguards, rigorous training, and deployment of adequate resources.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response are given the highest priority.\n\nThe CAA Amendments of 1990 required the EPA to formulate regulations for managing and reducing the probability of release of highly hazardous chemicals.  On June 20, 1996, EPA promulgated the RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requiring any stationary source utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity of a regulated substance to develop and submit a RMPlan to regulatory authorities on or before June 21, 1999.  Regulated substances include 77 air toxics and 63 flammable gases or liquids.\n\nMCAS Cherry Point has one process subject to EPA RMP regulations:\n\nA?    Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the WTP\n\nChlorine is used in excess of their threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers and used in the treatment of drinking water at the WTP.  The chlorine is stored under pressure as a liquid in up to four one-ton containers.  Typically, two of the four containers are connected to the chlorine feed system with up to 2 containers in storage.  \n\nThis RMPlan summarizes the primary components of the RMP in place at MCAS Cherry Point to correspond with specific EPA RMP requirements, including:\n\nA?    Management - A separate document, the \"Compliance Management Plan for Clean Air Act Section 112(r) Risk Management Program\" details specific requirements for a management system under 40 CFR 68.15.\n\nA?    Hazard Assessment - The Hazard Assessment evaluated a WCS and ARS with the chlorine storage area considered as mitigation because the area is an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.  \n\nInte"

      "SummaryText": "rviews with operations, maintenance, and management personnel at MCAS Cherry Point indicated that there have been no accidental releases from the covered processes in the five years prior to conducting this hazard assessment that resulted in any of the regulatory impacts.  In addition, according to personnel at the Air Station, no accidents have ever occurred resulting in this type of damage or human impact.  \n\nThe modeling methodology used in this study conforms to the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance recommended in the final RMP rule.  The toxic release scenarios for chlorine were modeled using RMP*CompTM Version 1.07.  \n\nThe WCS, as defined in 40 CFR 68.25(2), should be modeled to represent the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint, under worst-case conditions, beyond the stationary source boundary.  The ARS should represent a more likely scenario, under realistic conditions, but should still yield an offsite impact (40 CFR 68.28(b)).\n\nThe WCS for the WTP is a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas.  This scenario assumed a container valve failure releasing all of the contents of the one-ton container over a 10-minute period.  The chlorine storage area was considered mitigation because the area is an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.  The distance to toxic endpoint of three parts per million for chlorine was 0.9 miles under worst-case atmospheric conditions.  \n\nThe ARS for the WTP modeled the full release of one, one-ton container due to a hole in the container valve and the release rate was assumed to be equal to the release rate for the WCS.  The chlorine storage area was considered mitigation because the area is an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.  The distance to toxic endpoint of three parts per million for chlorine was 0.5 miles for the alternative scenario.  \n\n\nA?

This compilation of information enables supervisors and employees of covered processes to identify and understand hazards involved in the process.  The PSI compilation includes information on the hazards of the regulated substance, information regarding the technology of the process, and technical information on the equipment in the process.\n\nThe PHA update involves the systematic evaluation of the hazards posed by the regulated process.  The What-if Checklist analysis method was selected for analyzing the chlorine systems at the WTP.  The What-if analysis, a technique recognized by EPA, is a brainstorming approach that focuses on potential initiating events and consequences associated with a release.  This technique also allows for examination of current procedures and practices.  The PHA study was performed to identify and document process hazards and preventive and mitigating measures.  \n\nWritten Operating Procedures for each covered process were compiled that provide \"clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety information\" to include the steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  The Operating Procedures are available to all employees working in the process and must be reviewed annually to ensure currency.  The Operating Procedures for the WTP are a compilation of SOPs, manufacturer operating procedures, and Chlorine Institute operating procedures.\n\nTraining in an overview of the process and the operating procedures for each process has been performed for each employee working in or maintaining that process.
