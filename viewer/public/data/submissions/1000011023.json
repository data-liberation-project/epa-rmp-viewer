Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC ensures that only trained and qualified personnel engage in activiites, which relate to the chlorine distribution system.  All employees are required to attend Chlorine Safety Training during pre-employment orientation as a means of educating the entire staff on the properties, hazards and use of chlorine at the facility.  In addition, several selected individuals participate in 24-hour Hazwoper training on an annual basis, in order to prepare them for responding and coordinating emergencies involving hazardous chemicals.  Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC ensrues that each operating shift is staffed with appropriate personnel trained in 24-hour Hazwoper to ensure adequate coverage during all operations.  These business practices provide a solid framework to ensure a safe and efficient operation.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC is a Secondary Aluminum processing facility, manufacturing molten aluminum, as well as aluminum ingot and sows.  Chlorine gas injected into the molten metal as a fluxing agent to reduce magnesium levels from the bath.  The chlorine is injected and distributed throughout the molten bath by use of a molten metal pump.  Chlorine is distributed through a piping distribution system equipped with vaporizers.  Under normal conditions, eight (8) one-ton cylinders of chlorine are attached to the distribution system.  The system is designed such that chlorine is released from four (4) cylinders at a time.  The chlorine is released from the cylinders by opening a needle valve, as each cylinder is pressurized.  The chlorine is then piped to a series of vaporizers, prior to distribution to the melting furnaces.  Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC maint"

Chlorine is the only substance handled at the facility that is currently regulated under the OSHA standard at 29 CFR 1910.119 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), Section 112(r) Risk Management Planning Requirements.  Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is designated as a regulated toxic substance (gas) under the U.S. EPA provisions for chemical accident prevention (40 CFR Part 68) with a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds.  Since the facility stores chlorine in excess of the applicable threshold, Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC is required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan and comply with the requirements 40 CFR Part 68 as authorized by the CAAA, Section 112(r). The program must meet 40 CFR Part 68 Program 3 requirements, since the worst case offisite consequence analysis, in terms of the distance to 1 psi over pressure in the event of maximum storage container evacuation, could potentially impact offsite populations and receptors.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program an chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable codes and regulations.\n\nThe five-year accident history:  Superior Aluminum Alloys, LLC experienced two (2) incidents within the previous five years, which necessitated reporting due to release quantity.  The May 2002 incident, the larger of the two, resulted in a release of 175 pounds of chlorine.
