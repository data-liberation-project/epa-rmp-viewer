As part of this commitment, COY has established a system to help ensure safe operations of its regulated processes.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMProgram) that is designed to manage the risks at COY\u00bfs regulated facilities.  Additionally, COY's Risk Management Plan (RMP) complies with all requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program; the California OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standards; and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.\n\nCOY\u00bfs RMP consists of these three major elements:\n1.  A hazard assessment to aid in understanding the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and an assessment of accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMProgram Rule.\n2.  A prevention program to assist in maintaining and safely operating any processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to an accidental release of regulated substances from the covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in COY's RMP.\n\nAlthough an RMP will assist COY in providing assurance that the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of their overall safety program.  In fact, COY has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance, and injuries and damage resulting from a release of a hazardous substance.  Additionally, COY has a Safety Director who initiates safety committee walkthroughs, and obtains outside contractors to assist with maintenance and safety related issues regarding their regulated processes.\n\nCOY has limited its use of hazardous"

When a hazardous substance is used, COY considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect their employees, the public, and the environment, and takes steps to prevent such effects.\n\nCOY works to prevent releases of hazardous substances that are stored and used at its WWTP.  COY's WWTP is very well maintained, and the facility and process equipment were designed, built, and are being operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards were adhered to in the original design, construction, and operation of the facilities and its process equipment, and current regulations are adhered to in new designs, construction, and operations of the regulated processes.\n\nCOY limits damage from a release, if such a release should occur by training specific employees to respond to an accidental release.  In addition, COY works closely with the the COY Fire and Police Departments, and the Shasta Cascade Hazardous Materials Response Team (SCHMRT), to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimal, if a release from a regulated substance should occur.\n\nThe safety program at COY consists of a number of elements that conform to CalARP Program 3 requirements.  \n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCOY is committed to the safety of its workers, the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous and regulated substances.

If an accidental release occurs, COY will revise Sections 5 and 6 of their RMP to include information about the accident and the related incident investigation, and provide it to EPA within six months.  Additionally, the expected date of completion of changes due to the accident investigation will be incorporated into the RMP and submitted to EPA within six months of the accident.\n\nCOY provides response training to specific personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Yreka Fire and Police Departments, and the SCHMRT.  COY and the Fire Department have conducted emergency response training in February of 2005, and will be conducting another training session with COY's other emergency responders.  Additionally, specific COY employees will undergo trianing to be certified for using respirators and the proper PPE for responding to a release from the regulated substance.  Specific COY employees/responders are also members of the fire department. \n\nTo effectively implement these policies, COY has established a management system headed by the Public Works Director (Emergency Response Coordinator) along with the Water and Wastewater Managers, which have oversight for COY's faciities, to oversee safety-related and emergency response activities.

If these alarms are not acknowledged within a specific time, the on-call operators are called at their contact number outside of work and notified.  The on-call operators are within a quick reponse time of the WWTP facility.  As an additional precaution, there are on-site automatic audible and visible alarms (red lights outside the entry door of the WWTP process area, which will alert employees and visitors to evacuate the premises).  \n\nCOY has an emergency shut down system at the WWTP for the on-line chlorine cylinders.  Automatic shut-off valves are located on the downstream side of the flexible pigtail connection at each cylinder that will shut down the systems upon sensing low pressure in the piping downstream from this valve.  If a release occurs downstream of the vacuum switchover valve (vacuum loss), the valve will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Air-supplied respirators are located outside the chlorine process areas at the facility.\n\nAt the WWTP, four one-ton chlorine cylinders are strapped onto their saddle supports, which are bolted to the slab (per design drawings), and two 150-lb cylinders are strapped to supports, all within the chlorine process area.
