This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, Trotter Terminal is prepared to work with the Valley County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nTrotter Terminal's primary covered process activity is the storage of liquid 10-34-0 fertilizer.  Trotter Terminal has two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks on site to provide product for the process of converting it into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  This activity includes processing of anhydrous ammonia by an outside contractor, Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored until it is used in the process of converting it into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the spring and fall.  This process takes anhydrous ammonia and mixes it with phosphoric acid in a mobile T-reactor owned and operated by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The emergency procedures for Trotter Terminal are coordinated with the Valley County LEPC.\n\n\n\nTrotter Terminal, has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  This process conducted at the Ord location is done entirely by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC; and their process is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this location using Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC mobile T-Reactor equipment:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC maintains information describing the chemica"
