              "Description": "VENTILATION SYSTEM DESIGN\n\n\n\nWith the installation of the R152a foam system and the use of a hydrocarbon blowing agent R152a, Metl-Span?s existing building ventilation system was upgraded in areas where it was determined there could potentially be a release of or an employee exposure to R152a. This upgrade included the following modifications:\n\n\n\n?    The ventilation and extraction systems for the gantry areas and metering machine enclosures are composed of many suction ducts, which remove air from the low part of the confined gantry zones.\n\n\n\n?    Gantry areas each have one dual speed fan. The fan operates at low speed continuously. The high speed is used to reinforce the extraction capacity if 15 percent of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is reached.\n\n\n\n?    Differential pressure switches are installed on each fan to check the flow of air and provide signals to the sensor monitoring system.\n\n\n\nSAFETY SYSTEMS\n\n\n\nNumerous safety systems have been installed at Metl-Span to reduce the potential for a release of or an employee exposure to the flammable R152a. These systems include: the relief system; the interlocked controls of the process; the ventilation system (outlined above); the hydrocarbon detection and monitoring system; the manual E-stops at various locations, the nitrogen blanket system, and the facility?s grounding protection system. Each system is briefly explained below.\n\n\n\nThe covered process relief system has been designed to be activated when pressures in the covered process exceed the safe upper limits based on pressure relief valve calculations. \n\n\n\nWith the installation and upgrade of the bulk tank storage system for R152a foam equipment, the production lines, and the use of the hydrocarbon R152a as a blowing agent, Metl-Span has also installed hydrocarbon detection and monitoring system for its covered process. A dedicated power supply assures the detectors remain active in case of a power loss. A dedicated control panel for the hydrocarbon detection and monitoring system has been installed.  The logic for the detection systems is tied into the master control panel utilized for the manufacturing and blending of the product.  The master control panel provides an actual reading of the hydrocarbon levels rather than a range.\n\n\n\nHydrocarbon sensors, able to detect small concentrations of gases such as R152a, have been installed at eight locations throughout the covered process. The flammable vapor detector control card generates three signals: failure of the detector, equal/exceed 3.9 percent of LEL, and equal/exceed 16.9 percent of LEL.  The Hennecke control equipment will adjust ventilation or shut down the process based on readings from the sensors. \n\n\n\nMetl-Span?s R152a bulk storage tank and equipment and components within the covered process are equipped with a grounding protection system tied directly to the Metl-Span master-grounding loop. To limit the probability of electrostatic changes inside an explosive environment, all metal masses are connected to the secondary grounding system by means of copper/steel wiring.  A grounding reel has been installed at the unloading area for tanker trucks.  The grounding reel is used by the Metl-Span materials handling personnel to ground the tank system, while the tanker truck will use the grounding reel at the truck to bond the truck system.\n\n\n\nIn addition, dedicated non-sparking tooling will be provided for throughout the covered process and will remain in their assigned areas within the gantry areas or maintenance until use is required.  Hazard communication signs have been located to alert personnel that cell phones, pagers, and communication devices which are not explosion-proof are not to be in the gantry areas or within 20 feet of the R152a storage tank. \n\n\n\nThe fire fighting system in the area of the interior process is a deluge system previously installed at the facility.  The outside bulk storage area will have local fire extinguishers. The legs of the R152a storage tank are fireproofed.\n\n\n\nNitrogen blanketing is used to blanket the R152a bulk storage tank with 4 to 10 pounds per square inch (psi).  A bulk nitrogen tank has been installed on the Metl-Span property to supply nitrogen to the bulk R152a storage tank.  Using dedicated pressure regulators and gauges, the bulk tank is provided with the respective nitrogen supplies.\n\n\n\nAlso located throughout the process are manual E-stop buttons, which act as safety systems.  The E-stops are identified on the master control panel.  The E-stop button on each of the operator control centers will shut down the respective R152a system for the production line.   All other installed E-stop buttons are isolated for the equipment for which they are directly relayed and are not interconnected, thus one E-Stop cannot shut down the entire covered process.  E-stops have been identified for the conveyor system, master control panels, foam pour point equipment, unloading pumps, and transfer pumps.  Power disconnects are located on all major equipment and control panels.  In the event that an E-Stop should fail to activate, the power disconnect should be utilized.",

This commitment is demonstrated by Metl-Span's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is Metl-Span's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such releases were to occur, the Mattoon Fire Department would response to the release. Metl-Span has coordinated emergency response actions with the Mattoon Fire Department and has provided information to the Coles County LEPC regarding regulated substances our plant.\n\n\n\n1.2     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (?68.155(b)) \n\n\n\nMetl-Span manufacturers Insulated Metal Panels (IMPs) at its facility in Mattoon, Illinois. IMPs are lightweight composite exterior wall and roof panels with metal skins and an insulating foam core. Three raw materials are used to produce the foam core of the panels: diphenyl methane diisocyanurate (MDI), polyol, and the blowing agent 1,1-difluoroethane. The 1,1-difluroethane is the only regulated substance present at the facility. The maximum inventory of 1,1-difluoroethane that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 75,000 pounds (rounded up to two significant digits for reporting purposes). The 1,1-difluoroethane is stored in 12,000-gallon bulk storage tank.\n\n\n\n1.3     The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (?68.155(c))  \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. The pentane process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.

The hazard and operability (HAZOP) Guideword and What-If/Checklists methods were used to carry out these analyses . The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures  \n\n\n\nMetl-Span maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address the various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  \n\n \n\nTraining\n\n\n\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least every three years, and more frequently as needed.  \n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMetl-Span carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.
