The facility manufactures a flammable gas by process of catalytic reformation.\n\nDuring the process of manufacturing flammable gas, raw material flammable gas is combined with steam at high temperatures, which causes a reaction releasing product flammable gas. \n\nFlammable gas is stored in liquid form in stationary bulk tanks.\n\nThe ALEUS stationary source located at 3322 Road \u00bfN\u00bf NE, includes two 20,000 gallon (jacketed vacuum insulated cryogenic, horizontal) tanks of flammable gas, two 30,000 gallon ("

The equipment was designed by engineers. Documentation pertaining to the design of the process and recommended maintenance / integrity inspections are followed. \n\nProcess hazard analysis by HAZOP has been used to identify potential concerns and ensure mitigation to low levels of risk per ALEUS policy. \n\nIf contractors are used on the site, rigorous selection and training specific to the site is performed to ensure potential hazards of contractors are mitigated. \n\nA hot work program is used to lower risk from hot work. \n\nManagement of change is used for any alterations to the system. \n\nAn incident investigation process applied at multiple facilities in different geographic areas facilitates the timely review of all similar systems operated by Air Liquide ensuring identified risks are mitigated. \n\nAn emergency action plan is utilized. All employees are trained on emergency action plan. \n\nAudits of the system are conducted periodically and a pre-startup review occurs prior to startup after any significant change.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The covered bulk tanks were designed / installed and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and Washington state law. \n\nIn addition, the Air Liquide Electronics U.S. LP (ALEUS) facility at 3322 Road \u00bfN\u00bf NE utilizes safety equipment such as:\n      -gauges and internal piping to ensure the bulk tanks are operated at or below maximum allowable working pressure capacity \n      -overpressure relief valves for pressure vess"
