In 2001, the name was changed to Vopak USA Inc and then in 2002 the name was changed to Univar USA Inc.  Univar USA Inc  supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coating and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n \nUnivar USA Inc is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by Univar USA Inc are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.  \n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH  \n\n1.

      "SummaryText": "sponders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with Univar USA Inc products and facilities.  Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Our facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have four RMP-regulated substances stored above threshold limits:  Ammonium Hydroxide; Hydrofluoric Acid 70%; Cyclohexylamine; Formaldehyde 37%.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO:  The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a RMP substance in inventory onsite.  The RMP liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes by using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed.  For each Alternate Release Scenario onsite Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment were considered for active mitigation.  One Worse Case Scenario release of 350 lbs of Hydrofluoric Acid 70% resulted in the maximum distance of .6 miles to the toxic endpoint.  Another Worse Case Scenario release of 22,200 lbs of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) resulted in the maximum distance of .5 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The Alternate Case Scenarios involved all four RMP-regulated substances stored above threshold limits and resulted in the maximum distance of .2 miles to the toxic endpoint using Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA including:  1. Safety Information-Univar USA Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  2.
