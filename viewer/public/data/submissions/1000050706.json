These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  Darling Ingredients, Inc.' plan to improve safety are conducting yearly evacuation drills and offer continual training for operators.\r\n\r\nDarling Ingredients, Inc. in Ravenna, NE is a pet food processing facility.

The plate freezers are designed to freeze pet food.  The low temperature ammonia liquid flows across the freezer plates where it picks up heat from the product, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plate freezers to the accumulator via a suction header.\r\n\r\nVapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to low stage compressors. The compressed vapor from the low stage compressors is sent to an intercooler operating at +15\u00b0F. \r\n\r\nVapor from the intercooler is then fed to the high stage compressors.  During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to an evaporative condenser where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.

The IC will determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action and should activate the evacuation alarm if necessary.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, first determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area.   The use of a blow horn and/or alarm horn/strobe will inform employees that they are to evacuate the building.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor.
