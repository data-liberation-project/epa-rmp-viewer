The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by the excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia systemis inspected on a regular basis wth maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidlines in the ANSI standards.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered.  The manager conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe location has a 'site safety coordinator' as an extention of the EHS group.  These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, conduct regular safety meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contact with the corporate EHS group.

Training is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injury, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nThe emergency response program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Cone Ag, Inc. has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR  1910.38 AND 1910.1200).  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.
