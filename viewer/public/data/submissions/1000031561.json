All process vessels are included.  Everything in this prevention program applies to the unit.  We conducted a PHA and have incorporated the results into the process.  We comply with OSHA's PSM standard (Operating procedures, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, etc.) through the RMP rule which aids in the prevention of releases of these RMP substances.  We have systems such as tank dikes, deluge systems, and sprinklers to aid in the mitigation of a release.  Our primary prevention program are the employees who operate our process. These individuals are well trained to operate the process in a manner that will not release hazardous substances into the environment.  The site production schedule for anhydrous hydrazine fluctuates to meet the needs of our customers.  ",

              "Description": "The blending and shipping process blending, storage, and transfer of hydrazine, methylhydrazine, and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine.  This includes all process vessels, railcars, and containers.  Everything in this prevention program applies to the unit.  We conducted a PHA and have incorporated the results into the process.  We comply with OSHA's PSM standard (Operating procedures, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, etc.) which aids in the prevention of releases of these RMP substances.  We have systems such as tank dikes and sprinklers to aid in the mitigation of a release.  Our primary prevention program are the employees who operate our process. These individuals are well trained to operate the process in a manner that will not release hazardous substances into the environment.  Blending and transfers are done based on customer order volume.  ",

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles facility purifies hydrazine/water solution into pure hydrazine mainly for use in the space industry.  This is done through a small purification process which is maintained through PSM elements, RMP, OSHA, and EPA standards.  The purification process has 2 phases of which only one phase produces the pure hydrazine while the other phase produces a hydrazine/water solution.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the purificaton process mentioned above, the facility also stores and packages hydrazine, MMH, and UDMH for government use in the space industry.  This product is stored in in-plant use railcars, cylinders, and drums.  The product and storage/package equipment is maintained by Arch for the Defense Logistics Agency - Energy (DLA-E).\n\n\n\nArch also imports 64% hydrazine for blending with water for packaging and sale of various concentrations of hydrazine from 15.5% to 64%.  The blending/shipping/storage equipment is maintained under the RMP standards."
