This training includes the safe handling of regulated substances under the rule.\n\n\n\nBPU has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  Though these rules do not specifically address the covered process and its regulated substance, compliance with the general rules significantly reduces the potential for accidental releases of the regulated substance.  This facility complies with industry-standard practices for water treatment plants that use chlorine in bulk. \n\n\n\nAs for emergency response, BPU has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and action.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  In general, BPU plant employees would deal only with releases of a small amount of a regulated substance.  If the release is determined to be large or if the chemical is stored outside or has migrated outside from a release indoors, BPU would immediately notify the Fire Department and Wyandotte County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nBPU management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment at this facility and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\n\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \n\nBPU's Nearman WTP is a 54-million-gallon per day plant that treats raw water from underground wells in the Missouri River flood plain and provides drinking water to the community.  It does this through a s"

The treated water, now ready for use by the public, is transferred to a large reservoir and pumped into the distribution system. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance stored, handled, and used at this facility is chlorine. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 32 containers on site.  All of the chlorine containers are stored inside of a building.  The chlorine building is equipped with a scrubber system.  \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility's prevention program for chlorine complies with EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 rule for Program 2 processes.  To maintain compliance, BPU has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee-training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees and supervisors involved in operating the covered process.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, and industry-standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine.\n\n\n\nShould the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the NWTP is equipped with engineering controls designed to minimize the effect of the release on the surrounding community.  For chlorine, the storage containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of a release.  The plant also has a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during a chlorine release. \n\n\n\nFor the worst-case and alternative analyses, the EPA's RMP Comp (TM) was used.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThere have been two minor incidents in the past five years, of which both occurred in 2015. Very small amounts of chlorine were released due to either a failed gasket and/"

In all the aforementioned scenarios, the scrubber was allowed to run and mitigate any presence of chlorine.\n\n\n\nIn July, 2015, there were two minor incidents that did not release chlorine to the outside of the storage building.  These minor incidents were noted and are similar to previous releases where a pigtail to the gas connection of a chlorine cylinder leaked.  The other minor incident was a connection to the evaporator which spilled a small quantity <1 pound of liquid and gas chlorine.  In each case, the leak detector alarms worked and the scrubber was automatically engaged.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program  \n\nThis facility has established and maintains an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with local response agencies, such as the Fire Department and local HAZMAT team.  The goals of the Plan are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of releases to the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  It is also submitted to the Fire Department for review and comment.  Tabletop scenarios are held with employees and local emergency responders to ensure preparedness in the event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nFacility employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe NWTP added a tiered set of chlorine leak detector alarm levels in 2015. The range of alarm setting concentrations will help determine an increase or decrease of chlorine level in a room during an emergency.\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential c"
