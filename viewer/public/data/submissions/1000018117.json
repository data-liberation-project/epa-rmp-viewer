      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIn order to comply with federal air quality standards, East Kentucky Power Cooperative has installed and operates a flue gas conditioning system at Dale Power Station in Clark County, Kentucky.  The system will reduce particulate material from boiler combustion emissions through the use of anhydrous sulfur dioxide. Addition of the sulfur dioxide charges particles in the flue gas stream enhancing their collection in the electrostatic precipitators.  Anhydrous sulfur dioxide will be stored on site in amounts larger than the threshold quantity for 40 CFR Part 68 and is covered by these risk management regulations.  The process will be regulated as a program 3 process under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe process equipment and procedures have been designed to maintain the safe handling and use of anhydrous sulfur dioxide.  Equipment is designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards.   The sulfur dioxide pressure, temperature, and level will be monitored locally and remotely.  Alarms exist for high and low pressures and levels.  Each tank is equipped with a pressure relief plug. Procedures for safe operation include employee training, periodic analyses of process hazards, reviews of proposed process changes, equipment inspection and maintenance procedures, contractor reviews, and the investigation of releases that do occur, if any, in order to prevent reoccurrence. \n\nEmergency equipment provisions include an emergency shutdown, manual shutdown equipment, and continual remote monitoring of the system. Shutdown can be activated from the control room to stop process operations in a fail-safe mode. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with off-site responders.  In the event of a hazard beyond the capability of EKPC to control, employees and visitors will evacuate the facility and notify these responders according to the facility emergency action plan.\n\nTwo accidental release scenarios were modeled as part of the EKPC risk management progra"

      "SummaryText": "m.  The worst-case scenario assumed that the entire contents of an sulfur dioxide tank, considering the administrative control on capacity, was released within a ten-minute period.  This type of release is assumed to occur through catastrophic failure of the container due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects.  The alternative scenario assumed a valve failure with a 75% full tank.  The contents of the tank were assumed released from the 0.2 inch diameter valve opening. Both public and environmental receptors were determined for each release scenario.\n\n"
