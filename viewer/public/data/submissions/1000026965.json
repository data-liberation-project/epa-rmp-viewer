Executive Summary\r\n Risk Management Plan \r\n\r\n Facility Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Cyclone Grain, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nFacility Information\r\n\r\nCyclone Grain is a retail farm supply and grain handling service center, the primary activities being grain handling and anhydrous ammonia distribution to our customers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a product regulated by U.S.E.P.A. We receive anhydrous ammonia by truck via state and county roads.  We store anhydrous ammonia in two (2) 18,000 gallon storage tanks and distribute anhydrous ammonia to our customers in fifty-one (51) 1,500 gallon nurse tanks and twelve (12) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  Our combined maximum storage including storage tanks and nurse tanks is 580,643 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Our customers then use the nurse tanks in applying the fertilizer to the soil.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario \r\n\r\n The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the single largest anhydrous ammonia storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 83,948 pounds, which represents the volume of one 18,000 gallon storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.13 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative-Case Scenario \r\n\r\n The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. This would result in a release of 12000 pounds over a 2 minute time span until manual shut off could be completed. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.24 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility h"

Additional information referenced is found in the Indiana Agricultural Ammonia Law and the Rules and Regulations of the Indiana State Chemist.\r\n\r\n Five-year Accident History \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility or to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38, and 29 CFR 1910.120. We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations"
