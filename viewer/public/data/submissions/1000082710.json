      "SummaryText": "PLAINS WATER STATION\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Plains Water Station has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations and implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices, and the training of our employees. WRB Refining is very conscious regarding safety. However, if a release does occur, emergency response measures discussed below will be implemented to minimize impacts on the population and environment.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Plains Water Station operates 24 hours per day. The station is a water treatment facility that supplies water to Borger Refinery. The NAICS Code for Water Supply operations is 22131. Chlorine is the only regulated toxic material used at the facility. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant during the water treatment process in the manner mandated by state and federal laws.\n\n\n\nThe site is a \"normally unoccupied remote facility\" per the definition of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.119). The plant is automated to operate without continuous supervision. The plant is enclosed by a security fence with all gates and doors being secured during unmanned hours.\n\n\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT CHLORINE AND ITS USE IN THE PROCESS\n\n\n\nA. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nChlorine is an element of the halogen family.\n\n\n\nMolecular Weight: 70.9\n\nSpecific gravity (liquid): 1.467\n\nBoiling point: -34 degrees C\n\nMelting point: -101 degrees C\n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine is brownish and about 1.5 times as heavy as water. Chlorine is removed from the containers as a gas. "

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine exists as greenish/yellowish gas at normal temperatures and has a sharp disagreeable odor. Chlorine gas occupies 450 times the volume of its liquid state. Chlorine gas is approximately 2.5 times as heavy as air.\n\n\n\nB. REACTIVITY AND CORROSITIVITY DATA\n\n\n\nChlorine is stable. Chlorine is neither explosive nor flammable, but supports combustion. Dry chlorine is not corrosive but it easily combines with water to form corrosive hypochlorous and hydrochloric acids.\n\n\n\nWhen chlorine is added to water the chemical reaction is:\n\nCl2 + H2O --> HOCl + HCl\n\n(chlorine + water --> hypochlorous acid + hydrochloric acid)\n\n\n\nHypochlorous acid is the primary disinfectant and is thought to inactivate bacteria, viruses, and most protozoa by penetrating the cell wall. Certain protozoa that form cysts in adverse environments can, however, be quite resistant to chlorination.\n\n\n\nSome of the hypochlorous acid dissociates as follows:\n\nHOCl --> H+ + OCl-\n\n(hypochlorous acid --> hydrogen ion + hypochlorite ion)\n\n\n\nHydrochloric acid also dissociates in water:\n\nHCl --> H+ + Cl-\n\n(hydrochloric acid --> hydrogen ion + chlorine ion)\n\n\n\nChlorine is an oxidizing agent and will combine with impurities, if present, in the water to form chlorine compounds such as chloramine. Feeding of additional chlorine destroys some of these compounds (a procedure known as breakpoint chlorination).\n\n\n\nC. INCOMPATIBILITY DATA\n\n\n\nChlorine may cause fire and/or explosion upon contact with turpentine, ethers, ammonia, hydrocarbons, certain metal hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphates, or easily oxidized materials.\n\n\n\nD. TOXICITY\n\n\n\nChlorine, in and of itself, is not toxic. It is, however, classified as a poisonous gas because when it combines with moisture it produces corrosive acids. If inhaled the gas combines with moisture in the body to form acids that irritate and burn bodily tissues. Chlorine inhalation can cause lung damage and death from pulmonary edema. Oral ingestion is unlikely bec"

Exposure to greater concentrations of vapor or liquid can cause burns and blindness.\n\n\n\nSkin effects: Exposure to liquid will cause burns. Exposure to gas can cause burns.\n\n\n\nOther toxic effects: Inhalation is the major route of exposure. Exposure to 0.5 ppm for 8 hours or 1.0 ppm for 4 hours can cause transient reduction in pulmonary capacity. Exposure to 3 6 ppm can cause irritation of the upper respiratory tract, headaches, and coughing. 10 ppm will cause severe irritation of respiratory tract.\n\n15-20 ppm can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonia can follow. Exposures to greater concentrations can cause unconsciousness and death.\n\n\n\nChlorine is not listed as a carcinogen by NIP, IARC or OSHA.\n\n\n\nChronic effects: Chronic exposure is unlikely because of the disagreeable odor of concentrations of even 1 ppm. Tests indicate that intermittent exposures to concentrations of that level caused no observable adverse health effects.\n\n\n\nE. STORAGE AND INVENTORY\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored under pressure as liquid in one ton containers. Plains Water Station keeps and uses up to two (2) containers on-site at any time. Chlorine must be stored under pressure to maintain its liquid state. The pressure varies with ambient temperature. At 50 degrees F, the pressure inside the cylinders is 60 psi. Pressures increase as temperatures increase.\n\n\n\nThe safety limits for chlorine cylinders are:\n\n\n\nTemperature: Upper..120 deg. F; Lower..N/A. The cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that acts as a pressure release if ambient temperature reaches 158 degrees F. In reality temperatures at the storage conditions are those of the outside because the storage is not enclosed.\n\n\n\nPressure: Upper..250 psi; Lower..N/A. Pressure would be approac"

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF CHANGES (MOC)\n\n\n\nThe Plains Water Station has well-established practices and procedures to maintain chlorine containers, piping and material transfer systems, controls, and emergency systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance."

The water station ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe Plains Water Station also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design of process equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nHAZARD REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe Plains Water Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nWRB Refining uses the \"What If\" and other analysis techniques to perform these evaluations for water stations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe process hazard analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.
