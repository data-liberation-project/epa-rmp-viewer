These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario that would require either evacuation of the area or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place. \n\nAustin Water Utility (AWU) takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide gases that could affect their employees, nearby businesses, and the public. The facility operates under a current Risk Management Plan which details both the dangers associated with using chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the precautions implemented to ensure the safe use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the chlorination process of treating wastewater for discharge to waters of the state. Precautions include routine inspection of the equipment, proper stock of emergency response and personal protection equipment, and training of facility personnel on proper operating and emergency response procedures. The most probable type of release may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the chlorine or sulfur dioxide lines. AWU has trained a number of workers who know how to use emergency equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and other personal protective equipment to repair such leaks. AWU keeps a B kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on operational leaks. The RMP includes current standard operating procedures for preventative maintenance on the chlorination system. \n\nAny Emergency Response is to be done in conjunction with the Austin Fire Department. All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the likely types of leaks are available on site. Further, AWU personnel audit the facility to maintain the integrity of emergency equipment, communication systems and the training status of its employees. Austin Water Utility has worked with the local emergency responder"
