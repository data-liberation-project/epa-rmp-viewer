The determined end point distances do not cross any site property line. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of incident investigations and incident history for the site confirmed that there have not been any reportable releases for the past five years. \n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place and would be used to investigate any significant accidental release if one should occur and to identify and correct any root cause(s). These procedures meet the investigation requirements of the OSHA  1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA Shell Technology Center Houston Emergency Response Plan provides a written guideline for the emergency response organization in the event that an emergency situation (including fire, spill or release) should occur.  The purpose of the plan is to provide for the safety and health of employees, the public and the environment during emergency situations. The plan also provides for ongoing training of site emergency response personnel.  The plan is coordinated with the local fire department community emergency response plan.\n\n\nCertification\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to a specific endpoint for the worst case release scenario for an ethylene tube trailer is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor. Within the past five years, the ethylene tube trailers have had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b) (1).  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as defined in the site emergency response procedures.  The Shell Technology Center Houston em"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nShell Technology Center Houston management and employees are committed to operating and maintaining all processes containing flammable and toxic materials in a safe and responsible manner. A program of hazard recognition, risk assessment, safe operation, and release prevention combined with emergency response, ensures the safety of employees and the public, as well as protecting the environment.\n\nA Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) has been conducted and revalidated on all processes covered by the OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals to evaluate and mitigate risk. \n\n\nFacility Description \n\nThe Shell Technology Center Houston conducts research and development activities using chemicals, fuels and lubricants in laboratories, small pilot plant and developmental units.  The facility is located on 209 acres and employs approximately 850 scientists, engineers, technicians and administrative support staff.\n\nPotential risks to employees, the public and the environment associated with the hazards of chemicals in use are managed by risk assessment, safe design, mechanical integrity, management of change system, safe operating procedures, spill and release control plans and a site emergency response plan which is coordinated with community emergency organizations.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Assessment\n\nAn assessment of the chemical and flammable inventories in use at the facility has determined that the total on-site ethylene inventory exceeds the threshold RMP planning quantity for flammable gas. \n\nEthylene is used at the facility for several research and support projects including an on-site pilot plant operation. There are two stationary ethylene tube trailer unloading stations designed to safely receive and unload ethylene from tube trailers to supply ethylene to project users. \n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Scenario - Ethylene Trailer Unloading St"
