It processes ethylene feed to produce high-density plastic pellets which are then shipped by rail to other consumers. The Orange facility consists of multiple units that are handled as separate Process Hazard Analyses, including CPF, GPO, G-Line, H-Line, ERU, and Utilities. For purposes of the RMP, the CPF, H-Line and ERU were combined into a single reported process (Process 1) and the GPO and G-Line were combined into a single report process (Process 2). Note that the ERU connects to both the CPF and the GPO but was included with the CPF as the main process unit.\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, Orange Plant has a fundamental commitment to\n\nworker and public safety as demonstrated by a strict adherence to Operational Excellence principles and procedures. Operating in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others. The Orange Plant is focused on preventing process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) demonstrates this focused commitment. The PSM program involves the application of management systems and performance management practices to control process hazards through objectives, programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.\n\n\n\nSafety and environmental incidents are to be reported immediately and followed directly by an\n\nincident investigation which will develop the root causes and actions to be taken to avoid similar\n\nincidents in the future. Investigations will be conducted with the objective of determining the causes and prevention of future incidents.\n\n\n\nThe knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenanc"

The Accident Prevention Program summarized previously is applied to all OSHA PSM / EPA RMP covered processes at the plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors. In addition to the Accident Prevention Program activities, the Orange Plant has safety features on many of its units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (i.e. mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\n?    Release Detection.\n\n?    Release Containment/Control.\n\n?    Periodic inspection of process equipment.\n\n?

This PSI provides the foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analyses, developing operating procedures, and determining the applicability of management of change.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis is a systematic evaluation of all aspects of the process (equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures) to identify the potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of highly hazardous chemicals. PHAs are performed on existing and new units in all of the Orange Plant's processes. The Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), or other appropriate equivalent methodologies, were used to perform the PHAs on each covered process at the Orange plant.

The contract employer is responsible for assuring that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe intent of the mechanical integrity program is to provide a management system that ensures: (1) the equipment is maintained in a manner to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical and (2) the equipment is maintained by trained and qualified personnel to assure its continued integrity. Mechanical integrity covered equipment at the Orange Plant includes the following type of equipment: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping, valves, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.

Changes may introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards incorporated into the original design of the process and must be reviewed prior to their implementation. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), software, procedures (including operating, maintenance, and safe work) and emergency procedures be properly reviewed for potential hazards and authorized before being implemented. This system requires that any change executed address the following: the technical basis for the proposed change; the impact of the change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change. Affected process safety information (e.g., mechanical, electrical/instrument, chemical, and operating limits) and procedures (e.g., operating, maintenance, and safe work) are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.
