The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of AGP Grain Cooperative ( Cowles Branch ) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Cowles Branch is the storage of fertilizers for sales to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 178,582 pounds in our three 6,000 gallon storage tanks, and in our twenty 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi holding 42,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minute"

      "SummaryText": "s.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm ) is 0.52 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history ( or the most likely potential incident ) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm ) is 0.33 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institude Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safeety and Health Administration ( OSHA ), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility,\n     - to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n     a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n     b. Provided state and local authorities the emegency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III ( EPCRA ).\n     c. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
