Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nOrtec, Inc. is strongly dedicated to employee, public and environmental safety.  This committment to safety starts with our senior management staff and filters down throughout our entire organization. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated processes at our facility.  \n\nII. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOrtec, Inc. is a custom chemical manufacturer.  Our primary business includes various adhesives, coating polymers, and similar polymers.  We presently have two regulated toxic substances present at our facility.  These substances are Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] and Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester].  Both monomers are raw materials used in making our polymers.\n\nAcrylonitrile is stored in an 8,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum inventory for Acrylonitrile at our facility is 46,900 pounds.  \n\nVinyl Acetate monomer is stored in a 12,500 gallon storage tank.  The maximum inventory for Vinyl Acetate monomer is 55,000 pounds.\n\nIII. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.06.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nA worst case scenario has been submitted for a catastrophic release of Acrylonitrile.  The scenario release amount is 46,900 lbs of Acrylonitrile.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool, from which evaporation takes place.

      "SummaryText": "Acrylonitrile vapors and the manual application of sodium metabisulfite to neutralize Acrylonitrile spills.  The Acrylonitrile tank is also enclosed in a 16' x 16' sealed concrete walls.  This concrete enclosure limits the exposed surface area of a pool and thus the release rate is most probably less than the release rate reported in the scenarios.  Plastic sheeting is made available to cover spills, thereby limiting vapor releases.  Written operating procedures and a high-level alarm prevent more than 7,000 gallons from being present in the 8,000 gallon Acrylonitrile tank.  Both the Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate monomer tanks are inspected for signs of leaks or damage weekly by maintenance personnel and every 6 hours by operations supervision.  \n\n\nIV. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  Our facility also meets the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  For Acrylonitrile, a pre-startup review was conducted along with specific training by the supplier on the handling of Acrylonitrile.  All of our affected employees are trained yearly on the hazards associated with Acrylonitrile and safe handling practices.  The Vinyl acetate monomer tank system was reviewed and tested.  Employees were trained on the unloading procedures for both Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate monomer.  Only designated employees are qualified to unload Acrylonitrile or Vinyl Acetate monomer into the respective bulk storage tank.  \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nOrtec, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  We maintain current MSDSs fo"

Depending on the process, we use both the Hazard and Operability Study and Checklist methodologies to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance, safety, and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nOrtec, Inc. maintains written operating procedures in order to safely conduct activities within our covered process.  The procedure for Acrylonitrile tanker unloading addresses personal protective equipment required, abnormal conditions, and emergency equipment/supplies requirements.  This procedure is regularly reviewed and used by the operators each time an Acrylonitrile tanker or Vinyl acetate monomer tanker is unloaded.  \n\nTraining\nOrtec, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who handle monomers are competent in safe handling practices to protect themselves and their surroundings.  Refresher training is provided on Acrylonitrile handling at least yearly and more frequently as needed.  Air monitoring is also conducted periodically during unloading operations to ensure that workers are not being overexposed.  The results are posted for all employees to review.  \n\nComprehensive training is also conducted specifically for unloading of Acrylonitrile and Vinyl acetate monomer tankers into our bulk storage tank.
