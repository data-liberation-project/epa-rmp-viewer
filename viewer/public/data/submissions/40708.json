Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Cargill Juice North America (Cargill Juice) Frostproof Facility is located at 100 East 6th Street, Frostproof, Florida.  Cargill-Juice requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Cargill's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide advice and assistance in regulatory compliance matters for individual plant sites.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Cargill-Juice Frostproof facility is located in the southeast corner of the city of Frostproof, Florida.  The facility consists of a  juice manufacturing process, as well as areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of oranges and orange products.\n\nThe Cargill-Juice Frostproof facility has one ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system equipment is located in the southwest corner of the property in two engine or compressor rooms.  Because the equipment is interconnected it is considered one process for RMP purposes; however it is operated as two independent processes.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) or storage vessel for Ammonia Refrigeration System is located outside the main engine room.  This HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration systems capable of holding 5,185 lbs. of ammonia and was therefore used in the worst case offsite consequence analysis.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The Carg"

      "SummaryText": "ill-Juice facility uses its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Cargill-Juice facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in 1995 for the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  Periodic audits have been conducted as required by the regulation.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Cargill-Juice facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures have been used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, also to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the maintaining of current Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.   The Cargill-Juice staff also performed a PHA of the process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.

Accident History\n\nThe Cargill-Juice facility has had one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.  \n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cargill-Juice Frostproof Facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capabilities that complies with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Polk County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the District #7 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
