Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Owners, management and employees of Central Grain Corporation Site #1, Elizabeth City, NC., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia from Aqua Ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel have been trained and are prepared to work with the Nrwlland  Vol. Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and environment.\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe primary adtivity at the Elizabeth  City #1 Site of Central Grain Corporation, is in blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% Ammonia is  received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity of Aqua Ammonia stored at this facility would be 262,000 pounds in 2 - 10.000 gallon tanks and 1 - 15,000 gallon tank each of which is located in a 740 square foot dike.  This would be 78,000 pounds of ammonia  at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3.   The worse-case Release Scenario and the Alternate Scenario:\n\na.   The worse-case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia form  the  15,000 gallon storage  tank  in the diked area released as a liquid over a 1260 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 112,000 pounds of Aqua Ammonia which would contain 34,000 pounds of ammonia at 30% maximum ammonia content.  The distance to end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's  Model - Degadis - and the passive mitigation of the 740 square foot dike, is 1.56 miles.  The release would affect 21 residents.  The possibility of this worse case release occurring is extremely unlikely as the location personnel regularly inspect and rep"

The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a  release of Aqua Ammonia from a ruptured 3 inch transfer hose, during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 1 minute.  The calculated quanity of Aqua Ammonia released would be 1500 pounds which is 450 pounes of ammonia, based on the maximum of 30% ammonia content.  The distance to the end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis - is  0.07 miles.  This is 370  feet and would affect 0 residents.  The possibility  alternate release scenario occurring is unlikely as Central Grain Corporation's Site #1 personnel periodically inspect, repair, and replace equipment according to industry standard procedure.\n\n4.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Central Grain Corporation Site #1 facility has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia supplier's recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling, storage and use of Aqua Ammonia ids conducted with personnel at this l9cation.\n\n5.   The Five-Year History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua-Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or off site.  They have had no evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.   The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis Facility has:\n\na.   A written Emergency Response Plan  which is incorporated in the written community emergency response plan of Pasqultank County.\n\nb.   Provided state and locatl authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nThis facilities emergency response program has been discussed with and reviewed by the Newland Vol. Fire Dept.\n\n7.   Planned Changes to Inprove Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going p"
