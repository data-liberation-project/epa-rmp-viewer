Operators at SJCWRP are also provided quarterly refresher training on current safety procedures.  In addition, the CSDLAC ensures that operators and maintenance personnel at SJCWRP are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change procedures.\n\nCSDLAC prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nContractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures.  The contractors are informed, prior to the initiation of the work at the site, of the applicable provisions of the emergency response plan.  CSDLAC Field Engineering and Environmental Health & Safety Section holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process areas; controls access to the process areas, and evaluate the contractor's performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nCSDLAC WRP Section ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new covered-by-the-rules process, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process at SJCWRP that requires a change in the process safety information.

SJCWRP uses a permitting program to ensure hot work is conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nCSDLAC provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions at SJCWRP. This system allows CSDLAC staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  CSDLAC will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe opera"

Recommendations were provided to SJCWRP staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nCSDLAC WRP section maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures for the SJCWRP that provide clear instructions for chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  CSDLAC ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  The operating procedures include start-up, normal operation, shutdown, and non-standard operating procedures.  Also included are the maintenance and troubleshooting procedures.  CSDLAC updates procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine or sulfur dioxide equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nSJCWRP employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are trained in an overview of the process and detailed applicable operating and maintenance procedures.

The PHAs were reviewed in 1997 under the RMPP and Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  In addition, the process hazard analyses for all the four covered processes were further reviewed in 1999 under the RMP and CalARP requirements.  Based on this review, 47 additional changes were identified to further improve the safety of chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated by December 1999.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorination and dechlorination systems."

Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the SJCWRP during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nSJCWRP trained operators are first responders to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak alarms and accidental releases.  Operators from SJCWRP-East respond to accidental releases at SJCWRP-West when operators are not present after hours at the West plant.   Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  As part of the emergency response program, the CSDLAC have developed and implemented Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans for SJCWRP-East and SJCWRP-West for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nThe HMHWCCPs have been coordinated with the local response agency (Los Angeles County Fire Department).  The main elements of each emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an e"

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two most commonly used substances for treating wastewater.  The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (CSDLAC) San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant (SJCWRP) uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for dechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, SJCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  SJCWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the SJCWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County SJCWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the SJCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency (County of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The SJCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nSJCWRP is located on two sites at 1965 and 1971 Workman Mill Road, in Whittier, California.  These two sites are identified as San Jose Creek-East and San Jose Creek-West Water Reclamation Plants, respectively.  The treatment facilities are located on a land area of approximately 100 acres, bounded on the southwest by the Pomona Freeway, on the southeast side by Workman Mill Road, on the northeast side by the San Jose Creek Channel, and on the northwest side by the San Gabriel River.  CSDLAC has operated SJCWRP facility since 1971.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages, from the original 37.5 million gal of wastewater per day (mgd) to current capacity of 100 mgd.  The wastewater treated at SJCWRP originates mainly from approximately 600,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with ch"

Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also received at the East and West plants in sulfur dioxide trailers and transferred to storage tanks located inside the buildings.  The chlorination system at both plants consists of two chlorine bulk storage tanks, evaporators, chlorinators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The capacity of each chlorine bulk storage tank is 25 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in a tank at any given time is only 18 tons.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway and at the end of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer.  There are emergency shutdown switches (push buttons) located at each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.  \n\nChlorine gas detectors are used to sense chlorine leaks in the bulk storage and chlorinator rooms.

The release rates for chlorine and sulfur dioxide were thus estimated to be 662 pounds per minute and 625 pounds per minute (lbs./min), respectively.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine/sulfur dioxide is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tanks would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (111 deg F), and average relative humidity (64%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion analysis indicated that the toxic endpoint distance would be longer for the release of sulfur dioxide in comparison to chlorine release.  However, worst-case release for both chemicals have offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.

The meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 64 deg F, and average humidity of 64%.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the maximum ground level one hour average concentration for both regulated substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) would be less than 0.1 ppm (0.02 ppm for chlorine and 0.06 ppm for sulfur dioxide).  These concentrations are significantly lower than 3 ppm, the toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and will have no offsite impacts.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of these scenarios are highly unlikely because the flex hoses are inspected and pressure tested every two years.\n\nFinally, no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the SJCWRP during the last five years.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSJCWRP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.

The SJCWRP-West is manned 8 hours per day, and during the other 16 hours per day, alarms are answered by the SJCWRP-East operators.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nRMP and CalARP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  For the worst-case release scenario analysis for the SJCWRP, two scenarios were considered: (1) rupture of one chlorine tank with a maximum capacity of 18-tons, resulting in a release of 36,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration, (2) rupture of one sulfur dioxide tank with a maximum capacity of 17-tons, resulting in a release of 34,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide chlorine over a 10-minute duration.  Administrative controls are used to limit the filling of the chlorine bulk tank to only 18-tons and sulfur dioxide tank to 17-tons.

A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination and dechlorination facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the SJCWRP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nSince chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only two regulated toxic substance used at the facility, two alternative scenarios were selected for the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nThe scenarios selected for the SJCWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems at the East and West facilities involve the release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the monel flexible hose connecting the storage tanks to chlorination and dechlorination processes.  These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the storage tanks.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak by the chlorine/sulfur dioxide detectors installed at the chlorination/dechlorination facility.
