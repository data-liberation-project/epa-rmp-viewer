Box 3346\r\nMerrifield, Va. 22116-3346\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir or Madam:\r\n\r\nThe reason this Risk Management Plan is being updated is to report a change in facility ownership. This Risk Management Plan will cover Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, Inc. (VPGC) poultry processing facility located at Hinton Virginia, which was recently purchased from Pilgrims Pride Corporation October 01, 2004. The facility's refrigeration system remains as a standard two-stage refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. There is approximately 30,000 pounds of ammonia on site. Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management (RMP) regulations of these two agencies. These regulations are designed to prevent the accident release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur. Our facility emergency response policy follows the National Response Team's integrated Contingency Plan Guidance and is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed in the past for this site, which included consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternative release scenario. The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to and unspecified failure. The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario at the VPGC Hinton facilit"

      "SummaryText": "y involves a failure of the Pump Package Receiver under maximum storage conditions. The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint. The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. This scenario was performed using pre-defined conditions by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. The EPA mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind sped of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77 F), and average humidity (50 %).\r\n\r\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, note that the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\r\n1. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia this vessel could hold is 17,000 pounds. Under normal operating conditions, this pump package receiver contains approximately 5600 pounds and seldom, if ever, would reach the 17,000 pound capacity.\r\n2. Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point. At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor. The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground.\r\n3. Requirement to compare a 10 minute release to a one-hour standard.\r\n4. Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected. This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a 250 foot, 2 inch, high pressure liquid line that runs along the roof. Rupture could occur if corrosion"

Chemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and respirators for the refrigeration operators/mechanics use, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia. We also in the near future will be providing our refrigeration operators/mechanics HAZMAT Training.\r\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, VPGC will perform periodical audits and hazard reviews to enhance continued safe performance.\r\nOnly one accidental release of ammonia has been reported causing one recordable injury in the past five years. It did not cause any other significant damage onsite nor any known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. The facility HAZMAT team responded along with the local HAZMAT team.\r\nVPGC Hinton facility has an emergency response program, that has been coordinated with the Rockingham County Fire Department and the Harrisonburg / Rockingham County Joint Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LERPC). This program includes an emergency response notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations will be conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures will also be review at that time.\r\nVPGC employees 500 full time employees, which operates poultry  (Turkey) processing and further processing operations.

The scenario, by definition, is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint offsite using the typical meterorological conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 77 F and 50% average humidity. The scenario we chose to evaluate does reach offsite endpoints and a few nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\nThere is no passive mitigation for either scenario. We have recently conducted our PSM 5 year integrity Inspection, which included a non-destructive testing of the thickness of our pipes and vessels to find any corrosion problems early and correct them as soon as possible.\r\nVPGC accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n* Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration employees\r\n* Preventive Maintenance Program\r\n* Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration employees\r\n* Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\r\n* Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\r\n* Procedure for handling all changes to the system\r\n* Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\r\n* Up-to-date process safety information\r\n* Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\r\n* Non-routine safe work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\r\n\r\nThis program was developed with the participation of VPGC refrigeration operators/mechanics.
