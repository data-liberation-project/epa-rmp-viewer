The facility is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner using a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  \n\nCovered Chemicals\n\nThe facility is regulated under RMP due to the presence of chlorine, which is present in an amount greater than the threshold quantity as defined by the RMP rule. \n\nChlorine is stored on-site in 1-ton (2000 lb) cylinders, and is used to disinfect process water.  \n\nHazard Assessments\n\nWorst case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted. In the chlorine Worst Case Scenario, a sudden rupture and release of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder would reach the prescribed toxic endpoint  of 3 ppm at a distance of 1.3 miles from the chlorine release area.  Reference tables from the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants were used for these calculations.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is based on a leak from a cylinder valve, regulator or other cylinder fittings.  The toxic endpoint distance for this scenario is 0.2 miles, which only affects areas within the property line of the Celanese facility, and does not go off-site. Reference tables from the EPA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants were also used for these calculations.  \n \nPrevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented a Program Level 3 Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules, and in accordance with US EPA and OSHA requirements.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from the facility and include  the following elements: employee participation, process safety information,   process hazard analyses, operating and maintenance procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management"
