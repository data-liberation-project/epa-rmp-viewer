Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFuller Industries Inc. staff and management are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment includes a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Barton County Emergency Preparedness and the Great Bend Fire Department which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nB.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFuller Industries Inc. facility's primary activities encompass production of brooms, mops, brushes, and cleaners. There are 3 regulated substances present at our facility that exceed the threshold requirements. These substances are Isobutane (Propane, 2-methyl), Propane and n-Butane. The n-Butane is a component of a custom blend propellant commonly know as AB-46 and exceeds the threshold quantity at the facility.  These compounds are used as propellant in production of aerosol products. We discontinued the use of Formaldehyde at our facility in 2011.\n\n\n\nC.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 EPA regulations. The following sections briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFuller Industries Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes  the chemica"

It is accessible to all employees on the company computer network.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nFuller Industries Inc. conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and effectively controlled. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP). These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, Maintenance and process operations and are revalidated as needed. Any findings related to the HAZOP analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating  Procedures\n\nFuller Industries Inc. maintains written operating procedures to safely conduct activities within our covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes in a written manual and the company computer network.\n\n \n\nTraining\n\nFuller Industries Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all personnel and contractors have an initial general awareness training. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFuller Industries Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out the maintenance operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are "

Process operators, maintenance personnel and any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Fuller Industries Inc. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures and staff training is in place to ensure a safe startup.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nFuller Industries Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are implemented and being followed. These audits are carried out and any corrective actions identified as a result of the audits are addressed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFuller Industries Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Fuller Industries has never had a catastrophic release to date.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFuller Industries Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning procedures, accident prevention, and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees actively participate in the development of procedures, Process Hazard analyses (PHA's) and training activities associated with the plant RMP and plant safety in general.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Fuller Industries Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nD.    Five year Accident History\n\nFuller Industries Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\n\nE.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nFuller Industries Inc. carries a written emergency response plan, number 70.007, to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning of our emergency response equipment, the equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
