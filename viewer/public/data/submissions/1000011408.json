The Facitiy Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Shelby county Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release to people and the environment.\n2. Facilty Information\nThis facility is a retail farm supply center. We handle a variety of farm supplies, including pesticides and fertilizers. We are distributors of Anhydrous Ammonia, a product regulated by U.S. E.P.A. We receive Anhydrous Ammonia by truck, store on site in one 12,000 gallon tank and distribute to our customers in nurse tanks.\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nA. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 13,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capicity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. This would result in a release of 12,000 pounds over a 2 minute time span until manual shut off could be completed. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 miles.\n4.The accident release prevention program\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage  and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.000, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Additional information contained in our Safety and Environmental Manual.\n5. T"

The emergancy response program\nThis facility has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with ASHA standards 29 CFR 1910.38, and 29 CFR 1910.120. We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n7.Planned changes to improve safety\nsafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
