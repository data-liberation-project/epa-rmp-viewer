The facility is an existing operating source. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\u00bf\tAcknowledge the operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\n\u00bf\tIncorporate revisions to the RMP pursuant to the requirements of the CalARP and 40 CFR 68 regulations.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These federal and state requirements build upon the provisions of the \u00bfgeneral duty clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\u00bf\tIdentify hazards,\n\u00bf\tDesign and maintain a safe facility,\n\u00bf\tPrevent releases,\n\u00bf\tMinimize the consequences of releases.\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility must take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. The Tremont Group, Inc. has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated pesticides, in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the RMP regulations and the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\nThis updated/revised RMP applies to The Tremont Group, Inc. Woodland Agriform Farm Supply Facility located at 1000 North East Street, Woodland, CA 95776. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 and"

Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia.  Regulated pesticides are received, stored and distributed for direct application in pest control on surrounding farms. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail-car and stored in one 18,000-gallon, one 22,400-gallon and one 38,887-gallon (rail-car) storage tanks at the facility.
