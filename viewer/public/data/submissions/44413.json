      "SummaryText": "This document represents the updated and revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Woodland Agriform Farm Supply Facility operated by The Tremont Group, Inc., located at 1000 North East Street in Woodland, California. The facility is an existing operating source. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n?    Acknowledge the operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\n?    Incorporate revisions to the RMP pursuant to the requirements of the CalARP and 40 CFR 68 regulations.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These federal and state requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n?    Identify hazards,\n?    Design and maintain a safe facility,\n?    Prevent releases,\n?    Minimize the consequences of releases.\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility must take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. The Tremont Group, Inc. has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated pesticides, in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the RMP regulations and the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\nThis updated/revised RMP applies to The Tremont Group, Inc.
