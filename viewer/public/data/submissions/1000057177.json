ANPI (formerly the Apache Powder Company) has been manufacturing at its Cochise County facility since 1922. ANPI established a mission to be \"best in its class\" and recognizes that attaining that commitment means operating and maintaining its manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner. To prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances, ANPI has developed and is implementing a comprehensive Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. ANPI understands the risks associated with releases of hazardous substances and ensures that those risks are being well managed at its facility.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the safety of its employees and the public as well as to protect the environment, ANPI's RMP is a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning programs. ANPI has already begun implementation of this program. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities ANPI has developed and is implementing.\n\n\n\n2.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nANPI manufactures nitrogen-based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries. In simplest terms, ANPI converts anhydrous ammonia into various ammonium nitrate products. There is one manufacturing process at the ANPI facility consisting of \n\nten units (six production units, two support units, and two anhydrous ammonia storage locations). Although not all processes are considered covered by the PSM or RMP standards, ANPI's PSM/RMP process applies to all ten production units, support units, and storage locations: 1) Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area, 2) Nitric Acid Plant (AOP3), 3) Nitric Acid Plant (AOP4), 4) Liquid Ammonium Nitrate (LAN) Plant, 5) Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant, 6) Liquid Fertilizer Plant, 7) Brine Concentrator (suppor"

For the purposes of this Risk Management Plan, the Brine Concentrator and Powerhouse units are not part of the RMP covered process. Different safeguards apply to different units in the covered process, except for the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area and Liquid Fertilizer Plant which share safeguards. ANPI prevention program elements are, therefore, reported on a unit-by-unit basis for those units with unique safeguards.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the ANPI facility in an amount equal to or greater than the \"threshold quantity\", as defined by 40 CFR Part 68. Anhydrous ammonia is imported to the ANPI facility by railcar. The railcars are unloaded into the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area. Ammonia then enters into ANPI's Nitric Acid Plants (AOP3 and AOP4). The resulting acid feeds into the LAN Plant where it is reacted with more ammonia to produce LAN. The majority of the LAN is then pumped to the Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant where it is concentrated and converted from liquid to solid form. The remaining LAN is either sold directly to customers or converted into fertilizer solutions at the Liquid Fertilizer Plant. At the Liquid Fertilizer Plant, LAN is used to produce several liquid fertilizers to serve the seasonal needs of the agricultural industry.\n\n\n\n3.0 SUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\n\n\nThe potential hazards associated with ANPI's manufacturing process are related to chemical releases, equipment failures, and process upsets. The nature of the hazard is related to the type of event or accident that could occur.\n\n\n\nRelevant onsite or facility hazards associated with the production and support units are reported in this document on a unit-by-unit basis. Major onsite hazards include toxic release; fire; explosion; over pressurization; corrosion; overfilling; contamination; equipment failure; and/or loss of cooling, heatin"

The major offsite hazard would arise from an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia gas resulting in a toxic vapor cloud. Whether a release of anhydrous ammonia poses a threat to health depends on the concentration of ammonia in the air and the duration of exposure. If individuals remain exposed to high concentrations of ammonia in air for long periods of time, any or all of the following health effects could occur: 1) eye contact: severe irritation, swelling, partial or full blindness; 2) skin contact: severe irritation, blisters; and 3) inhalation: difficulty breathing, lung damage, and death by suffocation.\n\n\n\n4.0 EXPLANATION OF HOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\n\n\nANPI's RMP is designed to reduce the number and severity of potential hazardous substance releases. ANPI's risk to offsite receptors near the ANPI facility. At the ANPI facility, the frequency and severity of a hazardous substance release is reduced through the implementation of effective prevention, management, mitigation, and emergency response (ER) measures.\n\n\n\n4.1 Prevention Program Management System\n\n\n\nANPI's RMP reduces the likelihood of a hazardous substance release by implementing a prevention program. An organizational chart illustrating ANPI's prevention program management system is provided.\n\n\n\nANPI's prevention program elements are the same as the requirements for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). ANPI has qualified employees trained in PSM and has established an organization to assure proper implementation of PSM within the RMP.\n\n\n\nANPI implements a set of twelve management areas designed to protect worker health and safety in the event of accidental releases. To address the hazards of a potential hazardous substance release, the following PSM steps are taken a"

      "SummaryText": "t the ANPI facility:\n\n\n\n1. Employee Participation - ANPI consults with its employees on the development of process hazard analysis (PHA) and the development of the other elements of PSM. In addition, ANPI employees are provided access to all PSM information. ANPI has also prepared a written plan of action that describes how employee participation is implemented (ANPI Document No. PSM-0001).\n\n\n\n2. Process Safety Information (PSI) - ANPI has established and implements a written program that addresses and controls written PSI on each production and support unit in the manufacturing process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0002). PSI was compiled with respect to the hazard of the chemicals used in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process. ANPI implements good engineering practices for the design, maintenance, inspection, testing, and operation of process equipment.\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - ANPI has established and implements a written program to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards for each production and support unit in the manufacturing process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0003). ANPI has performed eight PHAs. ANPI established the priority order and schedule for conducting the PHA, addressed the items to evaluate in the analyses, decided the make-up of the PHA team, and determined a system to resolve PHA findings and recommendations. ANPI retains the PHA record for the life of the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n4. Operating Procedures (OPs) - ANPI has developed and implements a written program that addresses and controls written OPs process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0004). OPs are consistent with the PSI for each production and support unit in the manufacturing process. OPs address the steps for each operating phase of the manufacturing process, the operating limits, certain safety and health considerations related to the process, and safety systems and their functions. OPs are readily accessible to ANPI employees, reviewed periodically"

ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices such as lockout/tag out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the manufacturing area.\n\n\n\n5. Training - ANPI has well trained employees. ANPI trains each employee involved in an operating process and trains each employee before operating a new process or transferring into a new unit (ANPI Document No. PSM-0005). PSM refresher training is provided at least every three years. Additional hazardous substance training is provided to ANPI employees under the HAZWOPER and Hazard Communication standards. Training is documented to record that each ANPI employee received and understood the training. ANPI employees are held accountable for safe operations.\n\n\n\n6. Contractors - As part of its selection process, ANPI evaluates the safety performance and programs of ANPI contract employees in accordance with ANPI Document No. PSM-0006. ANPI informs contractors of process hazards and applicable parts of ANPI's Emergency Response Program (ERP). ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices to control contractor access to the manufacturing process areas. ANPI conducts periodic walk-through inspections to evaluate the safety performance of contractors. ANPI's policy is to hire qualified contractors who are trained to safely perform their jobs and who are knowledgeable in the hazards related to their jobs. The contractor's training is verified by ANPI. Safety rules are strictly enforced at the ANPI facility to ensure that contract employees follow safety rules. ANPI requires contractors to inform ANPI of any unique hazards presented by the contractor's work.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - When a modification requires a change in the PSI, ANPI performs a PSSR for new sources of hazardous substances (ANPI Document No. PSM-0007). The PSSR confirms that specific listed items are addressed before a hazardous substance is "

Maintaining mechanical integrity is vital to preventing releases of anhydrous ammonia from the ANPI facility. ANPI has well maintained equipment. ANPI has developed a policy and implements procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity (ANPI Document No. PSM-0008). Mechanical integrity training is provided to ANPI maintenance employees.\n\n\n\nThe schedule of inspection and testing is consistent with manufacturers' recommendations and good engineering practices. Daily walk-through inspections are performed for each production and support unit at the ANPI facility. Inspections are conducted to find any unusual or increasing vibration, leaks, stress corrosion cracking, or other indications of potential failures. Scheduled replacement and preventive inspection and maintenance for pressure relief valves are performed. Scheduled inspection and calibration of liquid level, temperature, and pressure instruments, switches, and shutdown devices that have safety implications are performed. Scheduled inspections of major powered equipment such as compressors, pumps, large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, and mountings are performed.\n\n\n\nAlso, process equipment is inspected and tested according to generally accepted good engineering practices and each inspection and test is documented. Any deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits are corrected in a timely manner. In addition, construction of new equipment is evaluated to ensure proper assembly and installation. Finally, maintenance materials and spare parts must be suitable for ANPI's manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n9.

Management of Change (MOC) - ANPI has established and implements written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures, as well as changes to hazardous substances that affect ANPI's manufacturing process (ANPI Document No. PSM-0010). MOC procedures ensure that specific listed items are addressed prior to any change. Also, ANPI employees and/or contract employees affected by the change are informed of, and trained in, the change before start-up. If a change results in a change to the PSI or the OPs, these PSM elements are updated accordingly.\n\n\n\n11. Incident Investigation - ANPI investigates each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, an accidental release of a hazardous substance (ANPI Document No. PSM-0011). An ANPI investigation team immediately initiates an incident investigation. The ANPI investigation team prepares an incident report and develops a system to address and resolve report findings and recommendations. In addition, the incident investigation report is reviewed with all affected ANPI personnel and the report is retained for five years.\n\n\n\n12. Compliance Audit - At least every three years, ANPI evaluates compliance with the provisions of the PSM (ANPI Document No. PSM-0013). ANPI specifies the requirements for the audit team and the report. Response or corrective actions to compliance audit findings are implemented and documented.\n\n\n\n4.2 Response Actions in the Event of a Release\n\n\n\nIn the event of accidental release of a hazardous substance that could have offsite consequences, ANPI response actions would include any or all of the following: employin"

ANPI process controls and mitigation systems are reported in this document on a unit-by-unit basis. Process controls in use at the ANPI facility include: vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, keyed bypass, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, rupture disk, excess flow device, quench system, and purge system. Mitigation systems in use at the ANPI facility include: dikes, blast walls, deluge system, enclosure, neutralization, and containment pad.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Emergency Response Program (ERP)\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, ANPI has a comprehensive ERP that is coordinated with the Cochise County Sheriff's Department (the local emergency planning committee [LEPC]). The purpose of the ANPI ERP is to prevent or minimize the impact to on-plant personnel, offsite populations, and the environment.\n\n\n\nIt is ANPI's policy to maintain a current and accurate written ER Plan for facility operations (ANPI ER Plan, February 1999; and ANPI Document No. PSM-0012). ANPI's ER Plan is updated on an annual basis as a minimum and is updated more often to reflect changes at the ANPI facility. ANPI employees are promptly informed of ER Plan changes. ANPI's ER Plan is all-inclusive and addresses a number of ER elements.\n\n\n\nThe ANPI facility is also included in the LEPC's written Community ER Plan. ANPI has developed a close working relationship with the LEPC to ensure that local authorities fully understand the ANPI facility risk and management systems. To better assist with ER, ANPI conveys accurate and up-to-date information about the facility to the LEPC. ANPI employees are also active members of the LEPC.\n\n\n\nApache Nitrogen Products Inc.

      "SummaryText": "ials technicians \"referred to as Level A responders\" are employees who respond to on-site releases or potential releases for the purpose of stopping the release. They assume a more aggressive role than a first responder at the operations level in that they will approach the point of release in order to plug, patch or otherwise stop the release of a hazardous substance with training emphasis on anhydrous ammonia. Hazardous materials technicians have received at least 24 hours of training equal to the first responder operations level and in addition have competency in the following areas and the employer shall certify that those individuals:\n\n\n\n?  Know how to implement the employer's emergency response plan.\n\n?  Know the classification, identification and verification of known and unknown materials by using field survey instruments and equipment.\n\n?  Be able to function within an assigned role in the Incident Command System.\n\n?  Know how to select and use proper specialized chemical personal protective equipment provided to the hazardous materials technician.\n\n?  Understand hazard and risk assessment techniques.\n\n?  Be able to perform advance control, containment, and/or confinement operations within the capabilities of the resources and personal protective equipment available with the unit.\n\n?  Understand and implement decontamination procedures.\n\n?  Understand termination procedures.\n\n?  Understand basic chemical and toxicological terminology and behavior.\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Emergency Response Training\n\n\n\nANPI has established an emergency notification system that utilizes a community-warning siren, Community Alert Network (CAN) telephone notification system, and, if needed, public radio announcements. In the event of a release, ANPI utilizes the CAN system to notify residences within a 1-mile radius of the ANPI anhydrous Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area.\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Community Outreach Program\n\n\n\nANPI has worked with the LEPC to put in place a community outreach program.

ANPI's community outreach program: \n\n\n\n  Presents the basic health hazards associated with ammonia \n\n  Explains how you will be notified in the event of an off-plant ammonia release \n\n  Details the shelter-in-place protection procedures \n\n  Provides general information on evacuation, fundamental first aid, decontamination measures, and special assistance needs.\n\n\n\n5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nOn 06-10-2014 @10:08 a.m. the ANPI Load-Out #2 platform sight glass failed allowing 26 tons of pressurized anhydrous ammonia to be released to the atmosphere from railcar GATX200102. The ANPI Emergency Response Plan was immediately activated by Security, as the Load-Out areas are monitored by CCTV. Employee evacuation and accountability was the first priority of the Incident Command Team. Additionally, SH&E personnel were dispatched to monitor the ANPI property boundary for ammonia levels to determine if the Community Alert for Neighbor Shelter-In-Place would need to be activated. There was no detection of ammonia measured at the boundary. Accordingly, the Community Alert for shelter-in-place was not activated. Simultaneously, the ANPI certified Emergency Response Team mobilized equipment and response personnel to shut down the ammonia release control valve. After 25 minutes, at 10:33 a.m. the ANPI responders closed the valve to stop the release. There were 12 employees and 1 contractor who were exposed during the plant evacuation, of which 7 received off-site medical evaluation and subsequently were released the same day.  The remaining six individuals received on-site first aid only and did not require further medical attention.\n\n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nApache Nitrogen maintains a continual improvement process to identify and implement process and/or procedural improvements to our safety program.

As the name implies, the UIR captures unconventional incidents, potentially outside the scope of regulation mandated incidents, which could have a detrimental impact on the safety of workers and/or the public.  Participation in the UIR process is available to, and encouraged among, all Apache employees.  All incidents captured by the UIR process are documented, reviewed, and addressed by Apache Nitrogen senior management.\n\n\n\n7.0 CONCLUSION\n\n\n\nAt ANPI, the risk for hazardous substance release is taken seriously and all employees are accountable for safe operations. ANPI has taken the appropriate steps to address the hazards associated with accidental hazardous substance releases. To continually improve safety at the ANPI facility, implementation of ANPI's RMP is an on?going process. As potential safety improvements are identified, these changes or enhancements are reviewed and implemented.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan summarizes ANPI's rigorous RMP. ANPI's comprehensive RMP consists of a prevention program that is managed in accordance with OSHA's PSM Standard. In the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, various ER actions may be employed including, but not limited to, the following: mitigation measures, ER Plan, community notification, shelter-in-place, or evacuation. ANPI's commitment to the RMP is a critical component in the mission to be \"best in class.\n\n"
