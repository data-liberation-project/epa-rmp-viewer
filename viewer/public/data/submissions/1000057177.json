ANPI established a mission to be \"best in its class\" and recognizes that attaining that commitment means operating and maintaining its manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner. To prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances, ANPI has developed and is implementing a comprehensive Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. ANPI understands the risks associated with releases of hazardous substances and ensures that those risks are being well managed at its facility.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the safety of its employees and the public as well as to protect the environment, ANPI's RMP is a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning programs. ANPI has already begun implementation of this program. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities ANPI has developed and is implementing.\r\n\r\n2.0 SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nANPI manufactures nitrogen-based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries. In simplest terms, ANPI converts anhydrous ammonia into various ammonium nitrate products. There is one manufacturing process at the ANPI facility consisting of \r\nten units (six production units, two support units, and two anhydrous ammonia storage locations). Although not all processes are considered covered by the PSM or RMP standards, ANPI's PSM/RMP process applies to all ten production units, support units, and storage locations: 1) Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area, 2) Nitric Acid Plant (AOP3), 3) Nitric Acid Plant (AOP4), 4) Liquid Ammonium Nitrate (LAN) Plant, 5) Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant, 6) Liquid Fertilizer Plant, 7) Brine Concentrator (suppor"

For the purposes of this Risk Management Plan, the Brine Concentrator and Powerhouse units are not part of the RMP covered process. Different safeguards apply to different units in the covered process, except for the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area and Liquid Fertilizer Plant which share safeguards. ANPI prevention program elements are, therefore, reported on a unit-by-unit basis for those units with unique safeguards.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the ANPI facility in an amount equal to or greater than the \"threshold quantity\", as defined by 40 CFR Part 68. Anhydrous ammonia is imported to the ANPI facility by railcar. The railcars are unloaded into the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area. Ammonia then enters into ANPI's Nitric Acid Plants (AOP3 and AOP4). The resulting acid feeds into the LAN Plant where it is reacted with more ammonia to produce LAN. The majority of the LAN is then pumped to the Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant where it is concentrated and converted from liquid to solid form. The remaining LAN is either sold directly to customers or converted into fertilizer solutions at the Liquid Fertilizer Plant. At the Liquid Fertilizer Plant, LAN is used to produce several liquid fertilizers to serve the seasonal needs of the agricultural industry.\r\n\r\n3.0 SUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\r\n\r\nThe potential hazards associated with ANPI's manufacturing process are related to chemical releases, equipment failures, and process upsets. The nature of the hazard is related to the type of event or accident that could occur.\r\n\r\nRelevant onsite or facility hazards associated with the production and support units are reported in this document on a unit-by-unit basis. Major onsite hazards include toxic release; fire; explosion; over pressurization; corrosion; overfilling; contamination; equipment failure; and/or loss of cooling, heatin"

The major offsite hazard would arise from an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia gas resulting in a toxic vapor cloud. Whether a release of anhydrous ammonia poses a threat to health depends on the concentration of ammonia in the air and the duration of exposure. If individuals remain exposed to high concentrations of ammonia in air for long periods of time, any or all of the following health effects could occur: 1) eye contact: severe irritation, swelling, partial or full blindness; 2) skin contact: severe irritation, blisters; and 3) inhalation: difficulty breathing, lung damage, and death by suffocation.\r\n\r\n4.0 EXPLANATION OF HOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\r\n\r\nANPI's RMP is designed to reduce the number and severity of potential hazardous substance releases. ANPI's risk to offsite receptors near the ANPI facility. At the ANPI facility, the frequency and severity of a hazardous substance release is reduced through the implementation of effective prevention, management, mitigation, and emergency response (ER) measures.\r\n\r\n4.1 Prevention Program Management System\r\n\r\nANPI's RMP reduces the likelihood of a hazardous substance release by implementing a prevention program. An organizational chart illustrating ANPI's prevention program management system is provided.\r\n\r\nANPI's prevention program elements are the same as the requirements for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). ANPI has qualified employees trained in PSM and has established an organization to assure proper implementation of PSM within the RMP.\r\n\r\nANPI implements a set of twelve management areas designed to protect worker health and safety in the event of accidental releases. To address the hazards of a potential hazardous substance release, the following PSM steps are taken a"

The ANPI Emergency Response Plan was immediately activated by Security, as the Load-Out areas are monitored by CCTV. Employee evacuation and accountability was the first priority of the Incident Command Team. Additionally, SH&E personnel were dispatched to monitor the ANPI property boundary for ammonia levels to determine if the Community Alert for Neighbor Shelter-In-Place would need to be activated. There was no detection of ammonia measured at the boundary. Accordingly, the Community Alert for shelter-in-place was not activated. Simultaneously, the ANPI certified Emergency Response Team mobilized equipment and response personnel to shut down the ammonia release control valve. After 25 minutes, at 10:33 a.m. the ANPI responders closed the valve to stop the release. There were 12 employees and 1 contractor who were exposed during the plant evacuation, of which 7 received off-site medical evaluation and subsequently were released the same day.  The remaining six individuals received on-site first aid only and did not require further medical attention.\r\n\r\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nApache Nitrogen maintains a continual improvement process to identify and implement process and/or procedural improvements to our safety program.
