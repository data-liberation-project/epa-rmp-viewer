The chlorine solution is then applied to the appropriate application point at the water treatment plant to insure adequate disinfection is provided as required by the Surface Water Treatment Rule.  A chlorine residual is also maintained in the distribution system to protect the distribution from potential outside contamination and to control microbial populations within the distribution system.  \n\nAccidental chlorine releases can be caused by a multitude of reasons.  In the event of a chlorine release (either small or large) employees are routinely trained on how to safely retain chloirne releases.  The plant also has a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) that clearly identifies how to unload chlorine containers, hook up chlorine containers, startup the chlorinators, and how to disconnect chlorine containers.  In addition to the above, employees are required to conduct walk through inspections of the chlorine facilities 12 times a day (every 2 hours) and document any potential problems that may occur.\n\nIn accordance with the guidance documents published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the worst case release will result in a toxic endpoint that will be approximately 0.9 miles around the Lanier Filter Plant. The worst case release will likely result from a fire in the chlorine storage area that could cause the fusable plugs on the chlorine contianers to melt and release the entire contents of the chlorine containers.  To prevent this from occurring, the chlorine storage area is constructed almost entirely out of non flammable materials (concrete and steel).   It is estimated that approximately 1,000 people would be impacted by the worst case release.  A release of this magnitude could potentially cause illness or physical damage to people within this impact zone.  \n\nThe alternative release case, which represents a more realistic chlorine release,"

      "SummaryText": "The use of chlorine at the Lanier Filter Plant has been ongoing since the original construction of the plant in the mid 1970's.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant at the Lanier Filter Plant to protect consumers from potentially harmful microoganisms (such as Giardia, Legionella, coliforms, viruses, etc.) that may be present in the raw water supply (Lake Lanier).  Although the use of chlorine has been known to produce various regulated disinfection byproducts in the finished water, the use of chlorine is required by the Safe Drinking Water Act and by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD).  The use of chlorine has been effective at the preventing waterborne outbreaks since the mid 1970's.  Disinfection byproducts associated with chlorine are  below the regulated levels as regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act and water quality criteria established by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.\n\nThe chlorine system at the Lanier Filter Plant was replaced in 2001.  Improvements were made to provide a safer system including automatic shut-off valves on each chlorine cylinder, enclosure of the chlorine storage area, and installation of a scrubber system to handle any release that occurs.  All of the chlorine analyzers, chlorination equipment, and chlorine gas and chlorine solution piping were replaced in 2001-2002.  The Lanier Filter Plant process safety management program and the RMP have been revised to reflect this new upgraded chlorine system. \n\nChlorine is delivered to the Lanier Filter Plant in one-ton chlorine containers by a chemical supplier.  Under normal operating conditiions, the Lanier Filter Plant will have up to 35 tons (16 in service and 19 in storage) of chlorine at any given time.  These chlorine containers are connected to a pipeline system (designed exclusively for the transport of chlorine gas) and delivered to four chlorinators.  The chlorinators operate under vacuum conditions and deliver chlorine gas to a chlorine injector."

      "SummaryText": "will result from a break in the chlorine gas transfer line with a simultaneous failure of a cylinder emergency shut-off valve and the scrubber system .  This release may produce a release rate of 185 pounds a minute for a duration of 10.8 hours and will produce a toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles around the Lanier Filter Plant.  To prevent this from occurring, all chlorine gas cylinders have emergency shut off valves and  numerous closure valves located at strategic locations that would provide containment of this type of release.   Chlorine monitors and alarms are also present that will promptly alert the operators that a chlorine release is occurring, and would start the emergency scrubber system that is designed to handle a 2000 lb release.   It is estimated that approximately 100 people could be potentially exposed to chlorine levels that may cause illness or physical damage under this alternative release case.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, an emergency response plan has been developed that identifies the operational and managerial procedures used to evaluate and determine if a plant evacuation is necessary.  The plan addresses the procedures for responding to minor and major chlorine releases and describes evacuation plans for the employees, contractors, and visitors, at the Lanier Filter Plant. \n\nAt the time of this submittal, there has been only one documented chlorine release at the Lanier Filter Plant within the past five (5) years.  This release occurred in April 1999 and was caused by a valve failure in a chlorine gas transfer line.  The valve was quickly isolated and repaired.  It is estimated that approximately one pound of chlorine gas was released during this event."
