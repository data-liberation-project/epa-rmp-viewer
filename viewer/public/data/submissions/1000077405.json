The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Farmers Grain Company (Clyde) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nA? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nA? The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the amount of 131,325 pounds was rounded to 130,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\nA? Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nA? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changed to Improve Safety\n\n"
