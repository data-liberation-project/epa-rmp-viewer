Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Gateway FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Baldwin/Red Bud fire department, Randolph County LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the blending and storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 2 - 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management and authorized contractors.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative release scenario. However, since this is security-sensitive information, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of  the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (6ht edition), commonly referred to as ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014,  as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Compliance with these regulation and on-going training of our employees make up our accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five yea"
