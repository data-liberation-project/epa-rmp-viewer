By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community along with the surrounding environment. MPLX - North Muskegon Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety/control devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the North Muskegon Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in two (2) storage vessels. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to an injection skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the injection skid and analyzer. In addition to rack blending, the process is also utilized for batch blending/tank blending. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fusible elements (fail safe valves), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, thermal and pressure reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the North Muskegon Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB.
