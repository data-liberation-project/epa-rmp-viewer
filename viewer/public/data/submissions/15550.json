The facility policy\n       The owners, management, and employees of Kernaghan's Service, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur the facilities are prepared to work with the local fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility information\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for the sale to farmers.\n        Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n        The maximum quanity stored would be 160,000 lb. at the Apple Plant. There are no fulltime    employees at the site year-round due to the seasonal nature of the business.\n3.  The worst case release scenario and alternative release senario.\n        A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum released at the Apple Plant  would be 84,200 lb. The distance to the endpoint  (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n        B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. the distance to the endpoint (200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n4.  The accidential release prevention program.\n        The facilities have implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\" , published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) , 29 CFR 1910.111 , \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5.   The five year accident history.\n         There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that ;  \nhave caused any de"

Planned changes to improve safety\n           Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
