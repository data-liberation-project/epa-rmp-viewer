The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The site can utilize local emergency response contractors to provide onsite and offsite emergency response services in the event of a release.  The local West Chester Township Fire Department is familiar with and periodically visits the site.  Butler County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Contingency Plan has been coordinated.\n\n\n\nREVISIONS\n\n\n\nThis RMP Plan was submitted as a correction on September 3, 2019. The reason for correction was to update the company name and email domain name in Section 1 and this Executive Summary from Univar USA Inc. to Univar Solutions USA Inc.  In late February 2019, Univar USA Inc. purchased the assets of Nexeo Solutions LLC.  Effective September 1, 2019, the assets of Nexeo Solutions LLC were transferred to Univar USA Inc. and the legal name of Univar USA Inc. changed to Univar Solutions USA Inc. There was no material change in the day-to-day operations and personnel overseeing compliance under the above referenced facility. The purchase of Nexeo Solutions LLC's assets and company name change do not constitute a transfer of ownership for the above referenced facility address.\n\n"
