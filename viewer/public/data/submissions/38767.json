This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturing. We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide is used for Reservol Production.\n\nThe maximum inventory of sulfur trioxide that is expected to be present in this facility  is 154,000 lb.(i.e., 10,000 gal storage tank at full capacity). \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCrown Metro Chemicals maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the SO3 handling process and reservol production process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operation and are revalidated at regular inte"

The most recent PHA was performed on 6/15/2004. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Crown Metro Chemicals maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is reviewed annually and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCrown Metro Chemicals has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCrown Metro Chemicals carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Crown Metro Chemicals to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 6/15/2004. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification is process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-Startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Crown Metro Chemicals. The most recent review was performed on 4/15/2004."

The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 6/15/04. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCrown Metro Chemicals promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nEmployee Participation\nCrown Metro Chemicals truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility\u00bfs the PSM and RMP programs, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. \n\nContractors\nCrown Metro Chemicals has not hired outside contractors in the past. A procedure, however, is in place in the event that an outside contractor is needed. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor would be carried out. Crown Metro Chemicals has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.

      "SummaryText": "ccur. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nCrown Metro Chemicals had a release of sulfur trioxide on February 19, 2004. Approximately 5 lbs. of gas were released over a 10 minute period. The Donaldson Center Fire Department responded to the release. No on-site employees or responders were injured as a result of the release. Five people off-site, however, were hospitalized the day of the release. The accident caused no environmental or property damage. As a result of the accident Crown Metro Chemicals improved equipment, revised maintenance procedures, revised training, and revised the emergency response plan. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nCrown Metro Chemicals carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.To ensure proper functioning, our emergency equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \nGreenville County, SC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. \n\nCrown Metro Chemicals has recently decided to turn over all response activities to the Donaldson Center Fire Department. As of the date of this submittal, this transition is not complete. Therefore, this RMP submittal addressed the existing Emergency Response Plan. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nRecommendations from the June 15, 2004 PHA will be implemented no later than September 15, 2004."
