Trade Secrets\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen Fertilizer, L.P. (PCS) facility is located on Highway 3115 between Highway 75 and 30 in Geismar, Louisiana.  The facility manufactures liquid Phosphate and Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid and Phosphoric Acid.  The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine and oleum.  The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility.  The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility.  The reported worst case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint.  An ARS was reported for each substance above the regulated threshold.  The scenarios were modeled for releases that are more probable than the worst case scenario. The scenarios reported in the RMP are presented in the following paragraphs. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nIn order to completely assess the risk involved with a toxic chemical release, PCS has performed a WCS analysis on all toxic chemicals (Oleum, Ammonia and Chl"

Using the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68 and the EPA general guidance for RMP, the worst case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the 2,500-ton Oleum storage tank.  RMP Comp modeling indicates that such a release would have a toxic endpoint of greater than 25 miles and affect a population of 593,085. \n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68.28, one Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was submitted for each toxic chemical present above the regulated threshold (Anhydrous Ammonia, Chlorine and Oleum.)\n\nThe ARS modeling for Anhydrous Ammonia was based upon the lifting of a relief valve in the Urea plant.  According to previous incident reports, this could result in a release of approximately 1500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  This release would result in a maximum toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles.\n \nThe ARS for Chlorine was based upon the shearing off of the liquid valve from a 2000-pound cylinder.  The hole in the valve body is 0.5 inch in diameter.  It was assumed that the hazardous material (HAZMAT) team members can rotate the cylinder so that the dip tube is above the liquid level and plug the hole within an 40 minute period.  The initial tank temperature was assumed to be the average ambient temperature of 70? F, while the initial pressure was assumed to be the corresponding vapor pressure of 150 psi (absolute).  The toxic liquid was assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The maximum distance  to the toxic endpoint was estimated at 0.1 mile.\n\nThe ARS for Oleum involves the shearing of the three-inch transfer pipeing at the maximum elevation of 15 feet. Since area personnel are present in the field 24-hours a day, it was assumed that field personnel would detect the severed pipe and manually shutdown the transfer pump within ten minutes.  The shearing of the pipe could cause the release of 174,000 pounds of oleum with a toxic endpoint of 8.7 miles.  \n\nAlt"

PCS strives to meet these objectives through the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs.  The key elements of these programs are:\n1. employee participation\n2. process safety information \n3. process hazard analysis\n4. operating procedures\n5. training \n6. contractor safety\n7. pre-startup safety reviews\n8. mechanical integrity program\n9. hot work permitting\n10. management of change\n11. incident investigations\n12. emergency response plans\n13. compliance audits\n\nEmployee participation    \nEmployee participation is an important element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) and the Risk Management programs.

      "SummaryText": "loyees, including contractors, in PCS Nitrogen?s Geismar complex.  A detailed Process Safety Information plan has been developed to help employees locate these documents when needed.  Process safety information includes information from the following areas: 1) Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all chemicals 2) other hazardous chemical information such as exposure guideline, physical property data, formulas, reactivity data, toxicity data, corrosivity data and vendor information can be found in their respective reference documents 3) Technology Information and 4) Process Equipment Information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe purpose of conducting a process hazard analysis (PHA) is to identify potential accidents or hazard scenarios that may occur and could result in undesirable consequences.  Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used.  PCS Nitrogen chose the ?HAZOP? (Hazard and Operability Study) and ?What if? processes.  PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances.  The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product.  The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, "

This program encompasses preventive and predictive maintenance of plant equipment, calibration and testing of instruments and electrical equipment, and routine inspections for plant equipment and piping.   \n\nHot Work Permits\n\nThe Safety Work Permit System establishes the safest, most useable method of providing all personnel, with procedures to consistently apply when performing work at sites under the PCS jurisdiction.  The Safety Work Permit system is broken down into 8 types of permits.  1) Confined Space- Attendant?s Permit, 2) Confined Space Entry Permit, 3) General Safe Work Permit, 4) Line Breaking  Permit, 5) Hot Work Permit, 6) Electrical Permit, 7) Excavation, 8) Vehicle Entry.  The requirements of each of the permits can be found in the PCS Nitrogen Safety Manual section 11.0.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThis process ensures that all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than ?replacement in kind? are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation.  Except in emergencies, such changes are approved in writing prior to their implementation.  This review process ensures that additional risk are not introduced, all changes are documented, existing procedures are updated, new procedures are written as required, all process safety information is updated, and that all employees that are affected by the change are properly trained. \n\nProcess Incident Investigation\n\nThe objectives of the Process Incident Investigation management system are to: 1) Carefully analyze and document the root cause(s) of the more significant problems that are encountered.  2) Identify, track and implement the corrective actions required to reduce the li"

The Primary objectives of EMPs are protection of life and elimination or reduction of harm to the public, employees, contractors, and the environment.  Secondary objectives are continued production and delivery of products and services.  Response and recovery actions must minimize damage done to facilities, equipment, and both delivery and communication systems. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThis plan ensures that compliance audits will be conducted in each operating department and service department exposed to highly hazardous and/or regulated toxic chemicals in the covered processes every three years.  The audits are directed by both a ?Corporate Process Safety Assessment Procedure? and an ?Internal Process Safety Assessment Procedure?. Each audit is performed by a team that is knowledgeable of the process.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAlthough PCS Nitrogen has a stringent release prevention policy, there have been six incidents within the covered processes at the facility. These are as follows:\n\n1. On March 2,1999, 176.3 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia were released when a process safety valve lifted on Nitric Acid Train No. 5.  During this incident there were no injuries reported, but 1,197 people were sheltered in place as a precaution.\n2. On February 22, 2000, a lens ring joint in the Urea plant reactor failed releasing 9,678 pounds of Ammonia to the air and water.  As a result, twelve people at neighboring facilities received medical attention.  \n3. On October 16, 2000, a pH fluctuation in the Urea solutions area nea"

      "SummaryText": "r Nitric Acid train No. 2 caused a release of 85 pounds of Ammonia.  At the time, there were seven contract employees working in the area.  When they detected ammonia, they immediately exited the area.  On October 18, 2000, one of the employees complained of chest pains.  Once PCS was aware of the complaint, the employee was provided medical attention.  After a medical evaluation, the worker was given approval to return to work.  \n4. On June 23, 2001, a lens ring joint in the Urea reactor failed, resulting in the injury of two PCS employees and the release of 5,752 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia to the environment.\n5. On June 26, 2001 the packing of a discharge block valve in the Urea plant failed.  As a result, one PCS employee was injured and 570 pounds of Ammonia were released to the air.\n6. On July 10, 2001, a relief valve in the Urea plant lifted.  This resulted in the release of 1,893 pounds of Ammonia. Sixteen employees at a nearby facility required medical attention as a result of the release.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the PCS Nitrogen plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP and PSM covered processes at this facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities will help prevent potential accident scenarios. \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the PCS Nitrogen plant has safety features on many units to help 1) contain and control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes. \n\nRelease Containment and Control\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \n2. Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases.\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releas"

The EMP works in conjunction with numerous other plans including Hazardous Materials Response (HAZMAT), Hazard Communications (HAZCOM) and various site-specific plans.  The core elements of the EMP are training of personnel, roles and responsibilities, emergency action levels, emergency operations center, exercises and drills, and notification procedures.  This comprehensive plan is available to all personnel in the event of an emergency. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPCS continually strives to improve the safety of operations and the impact on the public and the environment.  PCS has fully staffed, well trained and experienced, environmental and safety departments.  All members of each department work closely together to implement sound accident and release prevention programs.  In addition, PCS has implemented an employee driven Behavioral Based safety program to operate along side the traditional safety and environmental process.  This program allows co-workers to observe each other?s actions and anonymously report safe or unsafe behaviors and conditions.  Through the dedication and effort of PCS employees working toward continual improvement of SHE programs will result in further reductions of OSHA recordables and environmental releases."
