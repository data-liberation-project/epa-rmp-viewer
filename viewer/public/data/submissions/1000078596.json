DGP will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\r\n \r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nDenton Gas Plant (Denton), located near Lovington, Lea County, New Mexico, is a natural gas liquids processing plant that produces pipeline specification residue gas and natural gas liquids from field gas collected throughout the gathering system.  Denton handles flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantity containing one of more of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\r\n\u00bf\tMethane\r\n\u00bf\tEthane\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane\r\n\u00bf\tButane\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane\r\n\u00bf\tPentane\r\n \r\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Denton, which is part of the inlet gas and amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at Denton are well below the threshold quantity. \r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nDGP is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Denton Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Action Plan in which it has coordinated with the community's local responders in an effort to introduce them to the facility and its personnel.\r\n \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Denton process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.  DGP considers the systems developed for compliance with PSM to be the basis for good safety and business practices.  In this effort, DGP identifies opportunities to continuously improve initiatives for each PSM ele"

Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to the maximum intended inventory (MII).  New piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) and area classification drawings are under development along with material balances for completion in late 2019/early 2020.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with process operations.  \r\n \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA new PHA procedure has been established for DGP.  A new comprehensive PHA team including a highly experienced third-party PHA facilitator, experienced DGP operating personnel (operations and maintenance), DGP engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives will be utilized to conduct a new PHA in the latter part of 2019.  The previous PHA was performed at Denton on November 16, 2016.  Results and recommendations from these analyses will be shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.\r\n \r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nA gap analysis and completion of all discovered gaps in Denton operating procedures is in process.

Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control, and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.  Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library. \r\n \r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\nIn addition to the ultrasonic thickness testing program already in practice at Denton, a complete third-party MI gap assessment has been completed.  A third-party contractor is developing global DGP MI procedures.  After completion of these procedures, any identified MI gaps will be addressed to ensure the development of comprehensive inspection standards and procedures along with a specialized inspection program structured specifically for Denton.  The MI schedule for all DGP facilities is currently in development.  The Denton MI should be completed by the end of 2020.\r\n \r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nDGP investigates all PSM incidents.  Throughout the PSM program assessment process, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated as necessary.
