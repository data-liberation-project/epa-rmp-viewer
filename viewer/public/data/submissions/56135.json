      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nSchirm USA has long been committed to safe operations to prevent accidental releases and has worked closely with local responders. For the facilities subject to RMP, during design and construction local emergency responders were asked to provide input. Operating personnel were given emergency response training specific to the subject facilities over and above the regular emergency response training.  \nCompany Background and Commitment to Safety\nIncorporated originally as Agriculture Warehouse, Inc. in 1976, Schirm USA, Inc., was formed to serve the Agricultural Chemical Industry with Warehousing, Formulation and Packaging, as a third party for several industry clients. Whether solid or liquid, formulation involves various ingredients being mixed together either in a blender-type device or in a stirring-type device. This is a mixing operation -- no complex chemical reactions are involved. \n\nAnother facet of the business (in addition to formulating) involves re-packaging of many of the same products. The re-packaging normally involves receiving finished product from our clients in bulk format and load it into Specialized consumer-sized packaging according to customer specification. \n\nOur commitment is that our service will comply with all regulatory requirements and will meet or exceed the expectation of our customers in:\n\n?    QUALITY\n?    SAFETY\n?    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\n?    COMMUNITY CONSIDERATION\n\n\nThe Facilities and Regulated Substances\nThe two facilities subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements were newly constructed in 2008 and added a new type of process to the activities performed at the Schirm site, namely reacting chemicals. The RMP chemical involved is Isopropylamine (IPA).\n\nOne of the facilities associated with this process is a storage tank for Isopropylamine (IPA) CAS No.: 75-31-0. This tank has a total capacity of about 29,000 gallons however, the maximum to be stored is appro"

      "SummaryText": "ximately 26,000 gallons. The other facility is a process area which includes reactors in which a chemical reaction (acid-base) actually occurs and a new product (salt) is formed.\nProcess Description\n\nIn the processing area, to process a batch, a measured amount of water is added to the reactor initially.  One half of the concentrated ?wetcake? (acid) material needed for a batch is added into the reactor by mechanical augering.  After an amount of the concentrated wetcake is added to the reactor, isopropylamine (IPA) (base) is added at a fairly constant rate through a dip tube with an associated valve system beginning the reaction.  After the first reaction is completed, the other half of the wetcake is added to the reactor and then the other half of the IPA is added and the second reaction takes place. After the second reaction has stabilized, a final amount of water is added to achieve the desired pH and assay.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic. Once the reaction begins, the temperatures in the reactor vessel will be higher than the boiling point of the IPA. The temperature of the reaction is primarily controlled by the feed rate of the IPA.  \n\nThe reactors are cooled by use of cooling water circulated through the coils on the reactors which will also help control the temperature of the reaction.  The heated cooling water is cooled by passing it through a 200 ton cooling tower. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBased primarily upon volumes involved, the risk of an accident involving IPA is much greater at the storage tank. IPA is pumped to the processing facility in measured amounts and is reacted quickly as it is added to the reactor. After addition to reactors, hazard from IPA is nearly eliminated under normal operating conditions.\n\nThese facilities are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard therefore enhanced chemical safety procedures are involved. The Schirm plant has been subject to the OSHA emergency response requiremen"

Additional IPA is not supposed to be ordered unless the tank level is below the level that would accommodate a truckload of IPA thus helping to prevent over-filling. \n?    There are high level alarms attached to liquid level sensors that are mounted in the tank. \n?    Weight alarms are also included which are associated with load cells.\n?    The tank has a nitrogen blanket and a positive pressure of about 5 psi is maintained\n?    Personnel are to be present during filling and they would be aware of the situation and could use the emergency cutoff located at the tank area.  \n?    Fire Extinguishers are available in the area\n?    The tank is located in an area of the plant site that is fartherest from residences\n?    The tank is located with a diked area which includes a chemical resistant membrane\n?    A water deluge system is located around the tank\n?    Grounding equipment is available\n?    Only Personnel trained in the procedures for filling this tank and the emergency procedures are allowed to perform tank operations.\n?    Flame detectors which directly notify emergency responders are located at the tank site \n\n\nNumerous safeguards have been designed into the processing facility including procedural as well as equipment. \n?    A primary safeguard is that the process is computer controlled. \n?    There is an extensive system of sensors and valve control devices that are routed to the process control computers located in the Control Room.  This allows accurate measurement of the amounts of materials that are being added, the temperatures, and the pH of various liquids involved and will allow control of the temperatures, pH, and amounts through use of electronically controlled valves. Various interlocks are included to assure valves and other devices are operated at the proper time and in the proper sequence. \n?    Although the processes are computer controlled, they are not fully "

The procedures have been established in cooperation with local emergency responders.\n\nAll workers are trained in the emergency response procedures. Training includes identification of various possible emergency situations and how to respond. Some major aspects include:\n?    Annual fire extinguisher training\n?    How to shut down equipment in an emergency\n?    Periodic fire drills\n?    Emergency numbers (copies are posted on or near every phone)\n?

Major changes to procedures and/or when equipment is needed would require more formal training and documentation in accordance with management of change requirements.
