This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are stationed at the plant at all times to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled: Equistar's primary activity at the Victoria site is the production of high density polyethylene.  High density polyethylene is utilized in making a variety of plastic products such as grocery bags, plastic cups and plastic containers.  We utilize four (4) regulated substances at Equistar:  ethylene, hydrogen, titanium tetrachloride, and ammonia.  Of these substances, only ethylene exceeds the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario: EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) was used by Equistar to perform a worst case scenario.  Per 40 CFR 68.25(b)(2), the worst-case scenario is the greatest amount of flammable gas in the piping.   The worst case scenario for Equistar Victoria is a catastrophic failure of the pipeline supplying ethylene to the process unit.  This scenario involves the loss of containment downstream of the pipeline control valve up to the pressure let-down valve to the process unit.  A catastrophic failure of this piping would result in a release of 4,094 lbs. of ethylene to the atmosphere.  Utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) previously discussed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to an EPA def"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nb.\tThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar:\r\n\r\ni.\tProcess Safety Information - Equistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\r\n\r\nii.\tProcess Hazard Analysis - Equistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering process operations and maintenance.  The PHA's are re-validated every 5 years or if a significant change warrants a need.  Findings resulting from the analysis are risk ranked and addressed accordingly as specified in corporate guidelines.\r\n\r\niii.\tOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\niv.\tTraining - Equistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated wi"

At this point the operators undergo testing and are certified on the job.  Refresher training and re-certification is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nv.\tMechanical Integrity - Equistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \r\n\r\nvi.\tManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place at Equistar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nvii.\tPre-Startup Safety Reviews - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modification s in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nviii.\tCompliance Audits - Equistar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the applicable regulations are being implemented.  These audits are conducted according to corporate mandated frequencies and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  Investigation reports are maintained for a minimum of 5 years. \r\n\r\nx.\tEmployee Participation - Equistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Equistar is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program.  As a VPP Star Work Site for over 10 years, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\r\n\r\nxi.\tContractors - Equistar hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an event occur while they are on site.\r\n\r\nxii.\tFive Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of substance regulated by the RMP rule during the last five years. \r\n\r\nxiii.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\n1.\tEquistar maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the HDPE process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor. Within the past five years, the HDPE process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. \r\n\r\nI certify that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete. \r\n\r\nJames Guynes\r\nSite Manager"
