Box 300        Minden NE 68959\n\nRisk Management Plan  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention\nof any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the\nevent an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire\nCompany(s),  Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed\napplicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the\nimpact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is  NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged\nin operating county or terminal grain elevators\",  however we are also engaged  in providing\n\"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia\nfor delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving,\nstoring, and reloading is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\". \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields\nduring the early and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer\noccurs .   The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location\ndescribed is   127,449   Lbs. The maximum on site vessel size is   30,000 Gallons, storing\n127,449  Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a\nsemi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero"

      "SummaryText": ".  \nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night\nthroughout the year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing\ncalculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our\nlargest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity\nas limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) \nmiles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as well as possible public and\nenvironmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local\nEmergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site. \nWe believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses\nare protected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative\nrelease scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading\ntransportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is\n(Urban) 0.06  miles (317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the\nAmerican National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for\nthe Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\nAmmonia\".   We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and\ndistribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not\nlimited to: Excess flow valves,  Breakaway couplers at risers,  Emergency shut-off valves,"
