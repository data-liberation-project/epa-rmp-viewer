We provide a variety of products for both the farm and home.  Among the products we supply you will find anhydrous ammonia.  Our farmer customers use the anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for efficiently growing quality corn crops.\n    The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers this product as ?hazardous? and requires us to develop a risk management plan to deal with possible releases.  The nature of the product requires us to handle it with respect.  Our goal is to provide this valuable product as safely as possible.  In our plan we outline ways to protect the health and property of our surrounding neighbors.  We all share the air, water, and soil around us and we want to do our part to protect these resources by responsible use of our products\n    As a guide to safely handling the products we rely on a number of sources.  Primarily, we follow federal, state, and local regulations governing the storage and delivery of the product.  However, we also stress a strong safety training program and close supervision of employees handling the product.  We also use information on equipment and training from trade associations and vendors.  Lastly, our insurance companies are exposed to real life accident experiences involving this product.  Through their loss control specialists, they forward the lessons they learned to us.  \n    The EPA required us to complete ?worse case and alternate scenarios? for this product in our plan.  We not only completed these scenarios, but we studied the consequences of even small incidents involving this product.  We use this information to help us develop adequate emergency response for both large and small releases.  The local fire department is kept informed of our plans and efforts are made to coordinate a response to la large release.  \n    Our local fire department meets with us periodically to review "
