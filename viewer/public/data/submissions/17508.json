Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces a variety of polyester resins.  The regulated substance handled is toluene 2,4-diisocyanate.  For more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel of a regulated substance in a process are released.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors. \nIn Section 2.6 of the Risk Management Plan Submittal, the RMP*Submit software has a \"bug\" that does not accept release rates of less than 0.2 pound"

Our release rate for the worst-case release scenario is 0.0022 pounds per minute but we have input 0.2 pounds per minute into Section 2.6 based on instructions from USEPA.  Similarly, in Section 3.6, we have input a value of 0.1 pounds per minute as the release rate since this is the lowest number that can be input into this field.  The actual release rate for the alternative release scenario is 0.0037 pounds per minute.  There were no specific administrative controls considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the toluene 2,4-diisocyanate in a diked area.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenario for toluene 2,4-diisocyanate could impact offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The passive mitigation considered in the analysis was the storage of the toluene 2,4-diisocyanate in a diked area.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with written operating and maintenance procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first aid or"

Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. \n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement, process re-design and formulation substitution.
