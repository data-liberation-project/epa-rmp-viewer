This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\n    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Mont Belvieu Complex is a facility which receives raw natural gas liquids from pipelines and fractionates it into ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes and other LPG mixtures.  The liquids are stored on site in undergorund storage caverns and above ground storage tanks and then delivered to market via pipeline and transport vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a wellhead on an underground storage cavern releasing butane to the atmosphere over a 10 minute period thus creating a vapor cloud explosion with an offsite impact.  Since the cavern is underground and considered passively mitigated by EPA, the full well volume was not considered to be released under the program requirements.  API Publication 761 was used to "

In addition qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this occurrence.\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a shearing of a relief valve on a valve station, thus releasing butane to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The result of the release would have an offsite impact.  EPA's OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily, the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, which further reduces the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\n    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals),   1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.

In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.\n\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\n\nThe Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.

The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.

This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.
