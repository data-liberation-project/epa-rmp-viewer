If an emergency were to occur, it is this Facility's policy to notify the City of Fayetteville Fire Department and Cumberland County LEPC (Department of Emergency Services) via the \"911\" service and follow all additional response procedures set forth in the Facility's Integrated Contingency Plan, as appropriate.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Cape Fear Valley Medical Center and associated ambulance service via 911.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and hazardous material emergency response team (Operations Level) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Fayetteville Terminal transfers/stores refined product (regular/premium gasoline anddiesel fuel) and handles product additives, including the liquefied butane blending system (direct injection into refined product pipelines).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, the vessel, the blending/gasoline fast loop/Sample Recovery Tank skids, sampling unit (Bortec-Benke), and the truck offloading station.  The Facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the blending system's liquefied (pressure) butane vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shutoff device at 85% with an alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the end point (1 PSI overpressure) includes both public and environmental receptors.  The Facility's alternate scenario impacting off-site receptors is a BLEVE of the vessel.  The resulting distance to the endpoint also effects public, and environmental receptors.   The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Fayetteville Terminal complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's "

Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management regulations for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.    To this date, this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Fayetteville Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the City of Fayetteville Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and hazardous substance emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the City of Fayetteville Fire Department and the Cumberland County Department of Emergency Services.  The City of Fayetteville Fire Department, which maintains a full hazardous response team, is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, access via Shaw Mill Road, and available fire suppression equipment including approximately 20lbs. ABC fire extinguishers, and water sources (nearest hydrant available adjacent to State Route 210).  HazMat capabilities are available through the Fire Department, Motiva contractors, and NC Regional Response Team 3.
