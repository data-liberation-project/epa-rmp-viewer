We produce key ingredients for a wide variety of applications, such as additives to lubricants and greases, candles, plastics, tires, soaps, cosmetic bath oils, shaving creams, skin creams, printing inks and adhesives.  \n\n\n\nThe two principal feedstocks at Dover are naturally derived organic materials.  The primary feedstock is a distilled tall oil fatty acid derived from trees, and consisting mainly of oleic and linoleic acids.  These Fatty Acids are converted into a dimerized fatty acid, and either sold or used as a feed stock to the polyamide process, or processed into other fatty acids.  The second feedstock is castor oil, which is converted into waxy materials that are used by our customers as ingredients in lubricants and greases.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nArizona Chemical has one chemical that meets or exceeds the 112(r) rule toxic chemicals threshold quantities (TQ's): ethylene diamine (EDA).  EDA is used in the polyamide process as a reactant.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCorporate polices emphasis not only compliance with all applicable environment, health and safety laws and regulations, but also the development, implementation and maintenance of an accident free, injury free and healthful workplace.    All managers are evaluated annually on safety and environmental performance, and are held accountable for compliance with all applicable regulations.  This is in accordance with the corporate Arizona Chemical Environmental, Health and Safety Policies.  Arizona Chemical is committed to handling all hazardous substances safely to prevent their accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such releases.  \n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been developed and implemented for the purpose of protec"

Emergency training situations include potential hazardous material releases, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, and terrorism.  A plant specific incident command system has been installed.  The system is designed to be used for all types of emergencies, and is applicable to both small and large situations.  Plant-wide and community alarms are activated in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nIn addition to in-plant emergency response events, a system has been established in order to notify people outside of the plant.  Depending on the severity and type of event, the facilities/agencies notified include, but are not limited to: Union Hospital in Dover; Dover and New Philadelphia police, fire and ambulance services; the Tuscarawas County Sheriff; Tuscarawas County Local Emergency Planning Committee; and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency; and The National Response Center.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nArizona Chemical employs back-up safety systems, pressure relief valves, insulated vessels and piping, local emergency shut down systems, a containment dike for the EDA storage tank.  Arizona Chemical has a preventive maintenance program in place along with work planning, safety checks and reviews, audits of all operating areas for compliance with regulations, periodic inspection and qualified maintenance personnel.  To ensure safe operations, operators are trained and certified. \n\n\n\nOperations are continuously monitored.   Written procedures are in place and implemented by operators.  Internal and independent audits of the EDA operations are performed, and the results are used to improve the operations.  The 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management Programs have been fully implemented.  We have also installed a security system to allow only authorized visitors onto th"

A review of all incident in the previous 5 years indicated there were no accidents that met the criteria for reporting.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\nArizona Chemical has made several improvements to the EDA storage tank system in the previous 10 years.  The tank has been fitted with a new emergency vent and a heated conservation vent that vents to a scrubber.  Addition relief vents were instated in liquid EDA piping to prevent releases due to thermal expansion.    We continue to explore mitigation measures to protect the community and environment from accidental releases.  Arizona Chemical is continuously evaluating other actions that would mitigate a possible release.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nArizona Chemical has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its environmental responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of the program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified professional has been assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation and integration of the program elements.  Responsibility for implementing individual requirements of Arizona Chemical's program has been delegated to competent individuals.  "
