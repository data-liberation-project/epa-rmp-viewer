The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.\n\nThe Facility operates from 0500 hours to 1700 hours, Monday through Friday and is staffed with approximately 15 full time employees.  The Facility is secured with chain link fencing, locking gate, security cameras, and yard lights.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facilityA?s inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity: \n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\nPropylene gas (CAS # 115-07-1)\n\nAcetylene is packaged in a variety of cylinders, including 24 pound, 12 pound, 5 pound, 1 pound and smaller.  Airgas only stores these cylinders prior to shipment to customers. On-site bulk storage tanks of propylene gas are filled by a 3rd party supplier.  Propylene is then packaged in various sized cylinders by Airgas personnel to a maximum of 420 pounds.\n\nThe maximum amount of acetylene stored at the facility is 16,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of propylene stored is 20,000 pounds.\n\nThe EPA requires that the facility identify, analyze and report one-worst case scenario and one alternative-case scenario representing all flammable substances held above the applicable threshold quantities.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of a substance which results in the greatest release to endpoint (i.e. the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion).  For the alternative case scenario, a more realistic and generally lower amount of the substance can be assumed to be released than that considered for the worst-case scenario."

      "SummaryText": "  EPA-approved dispersion model, RMP*Comp, was used to estimate the end point distances for both scenarios.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The single largest vessel of propylene contains a maximum of 3,480 pounds in a horizontal tank.  There are four such tanks manifolded into a filling line, and all tanks are located immediately adjacent to each other.  Because of this, the worst-case release amount for the Tampa-East plant is therefore 13,920 lbs of propylene.  EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 13,920 lbs of propylene.\n\nIn consultation with Tampa - East plant personnel and AirgasA? Safety Director, a leak in a 100-pound propylene cylinder resulting from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative-case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released proppylene would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPAA?s RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute.\n\nAirgas South has developed and implemented a Program 3 Risk management Plan for the above identified processes as described in this submittal.  All documents pertaining to the RMP are kept on-site and updated as required."
