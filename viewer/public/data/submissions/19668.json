It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Prince William County Fire and Rescue Services and the Virginia Department of Emergency Services and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled.  The City of Manassas water treatment plant treats water drawn from Lake Manassas using a sedimentation/filtration process.  The facility provides drinking water to residents in the City of Manassas, the City of Manassas Park and western Prince William County.  The facility is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program due to the quantity of chlorine stored and used on-site.  The facility is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and therefore is in Program 3 of the RMP regulation. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  The worst case accident scenario is the failure of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine outside resulting in a toxic gas cloud.  The resulting distance to endpoint extends 1.3 miles and off-site public receptors are within this distance.  The alternative release scenario is a break in a 3/8\" diameter pipe connected to two chlorine cylinders.  This leads to an eleven-minute release of toxic chlorine gas inside the chlorine building at 190 pounds per minute.  The resulting distance to endpoint extends three-tenths"

      "SummaryText": " of a mile and offsite public receptors are within this distance.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  The facility has in place requirements of the OSHA PSM to aid in the prevention of such accidents from occurring.  Prevention program elements include an enclosure around the chlorine process including the cylinders that are in use.  Also the chlorine building is monitored for a chlorine gas release and sounds an alarm in the control room upon detection of chlorine gas.  Additional elements of the prevention program are operating procedures and training for employees who will be handling chlorine or maintaining equipment associated with the chlorine process.  A schedule is also in place for maintaining and inspecting equipment associated with chlorine.  Additional elements of the PSM are in use such as compliance audits, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, incident investigation, employee participation plans, hot work permit procedures, contractor safety procedures, and contractor safety performance evaluations.  \n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, offsite or significant onsite property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  A written facility emergency response plan directs employees in the event of an emergency to notify the Prince William County Fire and Rescue Services and the Virginia Department of Emergency Services and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the above responders.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  None"
