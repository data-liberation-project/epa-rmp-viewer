Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at United Farmers Co-op in Lafayette are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Lafayette Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\n\nexpertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in one 30,000- and two 18,000-gallon tanks at our facility in Lafayette (Figure 1). \n\nThe maximum amount stored is 98,600 gallons (507,396 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of\n\n85 %  including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\n\nfacility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\n\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the\n\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\n\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \n\n"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 2.0\n\nmiles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 942 people within 2.0 mile radius of the site. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\n\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\n\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\n\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\n\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.4 mile (Figure 3).

The following sections briefly describe the elements\n\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\n\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\n\nidentified and con"

These procedures address various modes of operation; the\n\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes .\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\n\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure\n\nproper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\n\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\n\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\n\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\n\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at United Farmers Co-op to manage changes in process chemicals,\n\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\n\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\n\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\n\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\n\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\n\nequipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUnited Farmers Co-op conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determ"
