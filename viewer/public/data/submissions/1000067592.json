CPRC adheres all RMP Program 1 elements to protect its employees, environment, property, and the general public from any off-site impacts that could occur as a result of operations at the plant.  CPRC operates its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations, which serves to reinforce its long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at their facilities.  \r\n\r\nRSF is an unmanned facility. There is a minimum of one Operator available at all times (night operations) who make rounds to all locations, including the RSF plant. As many as four Operators and one Lead Operator (5 total) are available during the day, depending on the operational demands, to make rounds to the plant. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan requires coordination with local emergency response agencies. CRPC employees are not first responders, and would request assistance from emergency response organizations for all emergency events. \r\n\r\n1.2 Facility Description\r\nThe Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant is located at 26835 W. Pico Canyon Road, Newhall, California 91354 in Los Angeles County, approximately 45 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 5 miles west of Newhall, California.  The facility is bounded by mountainous foothills and rugged terrain.  The nearest public receptor is residential housing approximately 5 miles to the east in the city of Newhall, Ca.  There is a dry creek bed that is approximately one mile away. \r\n\r\n1.3 Regulated Substances\r\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane are present at the facility.  No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities establish by this regulation.  The elements of the company's acci"

The Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant by complying with RMP standards has implemented all of the requirements of the RMP Program 1 prevention program.\r\n\r\n1.5 Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nCPRC has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases or regulated (and other) substances at the Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant.  CRPC has created a CRC South HSE Manual which outlines all necessary safety and environmental programs that must be followed. This includes policies for Incident Reporting, Safety Policies, Safety Rules, Safety Standards, and Safety Programs. \r\n\r\n1.6 Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe Rancho San Francisco Gas Plant has had no incidents in the last five years which have resulted in accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n1.7 Emergency Response Program Summary\r\nCPRC is not a first responder. CRPC has provided the Business Emergency Plans (BEP) and Hazardous Materials Inventory (HMI) to the local CUPA for inclusion in the local hazardous materials area plan. During an emergency event, CRPC can shut down the plant and send all gas to the flare. CRPC would request assistance from local emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\n1.8 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \r\nCurrently, CRPC is reviewing plans to decommission and deregister the plant. This plant should be completed by 2020."
