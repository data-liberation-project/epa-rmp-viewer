These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety.  Smithfield Packing Co., program enables our facility to prevent the occurrance of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmentaldamage. \n\n Smithfield Packing Co., safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.     \n\n Smithfield Packing Co., safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices which govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of  Smithfield Packing Co., through training and documentation. \n\n Smithfield Packing Co., is a  processing and packaging company which utilizes approximately 39,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping area's.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario, failure of the high pressure receiver,"

The release would travel up to 1.4 miles before no longer posing a significant hazard to the public. However, this scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\nWorst case weather conditions are uncommon...\nThe vessel is in a protected area clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic...\nIndustry standards for the construction and quality control of pressure vessels...\nSafety relief valves preventing over-pressurization of the vessel are in use.\nAccident prevention programs in place...\nMechanical integrity program, inspection and testing procedures are in place\nEmergency alerting alarms intergrated into the process system...\nEmergency response and action plans in place at the facility...\n\nIn an alternative case scenario, a 1/2\" diameter hole at the transfer hose could release approximately 2900 pounds  of ammonia over a ten minute  period before no longer posing a significant threat or hazard. The vapor could travel as far as .20 miles. This scenario was chosen as an alternative release because of it's higher likelyhood that it could occur. This scenario even though potentially possible, is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nEmergency shut-down procedures...\nRegular maintenance  upgrade...\nInspection and rounds made daily of the process system to ensure safe operation...\nEmergency response plan and refrigeration personnel on-site around the clock...\n\n Smithfield Packing Co.,accidental release prevention program's are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, American National Safety Standards, and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration 2 - 1992.
