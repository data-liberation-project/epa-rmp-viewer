It is a zero-liquid-discharge facility and employs state of the art equipment and processes to control air emissions.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the selective catalytic reduction process to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOX.)  Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic chemical and an uncontrolled release could be hazardous to employees and to the public.  The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a liquid under pressure in two 68,304-pound (12,070-gallon) usable capacity storage tanks.\n\n\n\nFacility's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\n\n\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia necessitates a facility Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as a Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Because both programs focus on the health and safety concerns of storing and processing anhydrous ammonia, Rocky Mountain Energy Center has developed these two programs together. RMEC is a secure facility that is attended 24/7. The ammonia storage and distribution system is continually monitored and formally inspected at least twice daily. All plant personnel have been trained to operate and maintain the ammonia system to the highest standards.\n\n\n\nXcel Energy has made a major commitment to worker safety and environmental compliance at its facilities nationwide.  Comprehensive corporate guidelines govern the development of all facility safety, health, and environmental procedures.  Facility employees conduct monthly safety meetings and participate in daily morning meeting to discuss upcoming evolutions, co-ordinate work objectives and discuss all out standing safety, environmental, and health concerns\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release preventio"

      "SummaryText": "n and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nRelease prevention at RMEC is in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program standard, OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, OSHA's Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia standard, and the UFC Hazardous Materials Management System guidelines.  RMEC has taken several technical and administrative steps beyond those specified in the standards to prevent releases.  Passive mitigation includes a secondary containment berm and redundant storage and handling equipment.  A deluge system provides active mitigation.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\n\n\nRMEC is a 10 year old facility and has no history of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\n\n\nAll RMEC personnel are trained to the first responder / awareness level, in the emergency response plan, and facility safety and environmental procedures.  Most employees have additional responsibilities and training under the facility's Emergency Response procedure.  Coordination with local emergency responders is accomplished through the 9-1-1 system.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nRMEC has established Safety, Environmental, Health procedures that will continue to improve site and public safety.  A training component is incorporated into the monthly Safety Meeting schedule. "
