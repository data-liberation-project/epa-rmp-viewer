(Reser's Deer Creek) refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Reser's Deer Creek to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \r\n\r\n1.1.2.\tSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\n1.1.3.\tWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\r\n\r\n1.2.1.\tReser's Deer Creek is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees only. Management personnel, visitors and contractors are accompanied by trained personnel of the refrigeration team.\r\n\r\n1.2.2.\tThe regulated substance handled at"

In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly.  The worst-case weather scenarios are uncommon.  \r\n\r\n1.4.\tAlternative Scenario. \r\n\r\n1.4.1.\tSeveral alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1 opening in a high-pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 6,640 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4.2.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.2 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 300 with the closest residence and schools inside the release zone.  \r\n\r\n1.4.3.\tThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves.
