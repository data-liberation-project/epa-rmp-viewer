Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored,and distibuted for direct application as fertilizer for crop production.. \n3.The worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.\n\n    a.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a 10 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be3.3  miles. The maximun quantity released would be 110,000 volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.\n     b. The alternative release scenario; a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shutdown value/values intervines or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the end-point of dispersion to 200 ppm is .30 mile.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n   The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Saftey Requirments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia k-61.1\", published by The American Standards Institute in,.(ANSI) and the standards of the U>S> Occupational Safety and Health Adminstrtion (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111,\"Storage and Handling of ANhydrous Ammonia\".
