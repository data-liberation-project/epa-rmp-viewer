Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \nHP Hood LLC is committed to operating its Batavia, NY plant (Hood Batavia) in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community. Hood Batavia uses anhydrous ammonia for product and process cooling.  Hood Batavia has implemented safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  Hood Batavia has also implemented a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified associates, and emergency procedures designed to enable trained operators to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nB. Ammonia is the only RMP covered substance at the plant.\n\nC.  Description of the Risk Management Plan \nHood Batavia is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA Process Safety Management program for the ammonia refrigeration process. These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History \nThere have been no accidents or incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\nAn Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) has been implemented at the facility that includes the provisions of an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).
