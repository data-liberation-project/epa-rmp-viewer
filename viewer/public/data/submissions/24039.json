To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods- Jacksonville, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods- Jacksonville, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance(s) handled.\n\u00a8 Poultry Processingr Facility\n\u00a8 Anhydrous Ammonia used for refrigeration\n\u00a8 We have on-site approximately 31,000 pounds of ammonia.\n \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n       \nWorst-case Scenario. - Failure of high-pressure receiver when full releasing 16,383 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high-pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high-pressure receiver.  The loss of 16,383 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.5  miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet"
