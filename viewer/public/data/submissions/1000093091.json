The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more\n\nthan a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process per 40 CFR 68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three (3) tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities\n\nwith a lower risk of offsite impacts. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2 and 3. Program 1 is\n\ndefined by a process that has had no accidental release causing offsite impacts in the past five (5)\n\nyears or the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint based\n\non the worst-case release scenario. Program 3 applies to a process that is subject to Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) or is not classified in\n\nany of the Program 3 NAICS codes defined in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). Program 2 applies to processes not\n\ndefined by Program 1 or 3. Therefore, the C. C. Williams Wastewater Treatment Facility processes\n\nare subject to Program 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the C. C. Williams facility located at\n\n1600 Yeend Street in Mobile, Alabama. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for treated wastewater,\n\nwith the facility storing approximately twelve (12) one-ton cylinders containing chlorine under\n\nnormal operating conditions. In addition to chlorine cylinders, there are six (6) one-ton cylinders of\n\nsulfur dioxide, used to remove free chlorine residuals from the treated wastewater, stored on-site.\n\nAs stated above, chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide\n\nis used for the dechlorination of the wastewater effluent after chlorination and before discharge.\n\nThe C. C. Williams facility utilizes more than the "

The initial RMP was submitted by June 21, 1999. A five (5) year update was\n\nmade by Malcolm Pirnie in January 2005 updating the offsite consequence analyses determining\n\nwhether the parameters and assumptions used are still valid. To comply with the five (5) year update\n\nrequirement in 2010, Goodwyn Mills Cawood (GMC) reviewed the offsite consequence analyses to\n\ndetermine whether the parameters assumptions used are still valid and to make any necessary\n\nchanges to update the RMP. In 2016 and 2021, GMC and the Operations staff the CC Williams Facility\n\nreviewed and updated the plan.\n\n\n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe C. C. Williams facility has established procedures to ensure the integrity of the chlorination and\n\ndechlorination systems, and minimize the potential for releases. Standard protocols have been\n\nestablished for items such as systems operations, maintenance, training, and incident investigation.\n\nTo ensure the safety of the C. C. Williams facility chlorination, the facility relies on the commitment\n\nand team effort of its employees and suppliers.\n\nThe C. C. Williams facility has a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of thirty (30) employees on duty\n\nat any given time, which are trained on safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination\n\nsystems. Daily inspections of the areas storing and/or using chlorine and sulfur dioxide are\n\nconducted by the facility employees. The area that stores the containers is fully enclosed and is\n\nequipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. The caustic\n\nscrubber system is equipped with detectors that will automatically activate the scrubber system if\n\na chlorine or sulfur dioxide concentration of three (3) parts per million or greater is present.

The facility has four (4) one-ton chlorine cylinders and two (2) oneton\n\nsulfur dioxide cylinders connected to the proportional feed system at all times.
