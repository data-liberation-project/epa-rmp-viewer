The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more\r\nthan a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process per 40 CFR 68.115.\r\nThe USEPA has established three (3) tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities\r\nwith a lower risk of offsite impacts. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2 and 3. Program 1 is\r\ndefined by a process that has had no accidental release causing offsite impacts in the past five (5)\r\nyears or the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint based\r\non the worst-case release scenario. Program 3 applies to a process that is subject to Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) or is not classified in\r\nany of the Program 3 NAICS codes defined in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). Program 2 applies to processes not\r\ndefined by Program 1 or 3. Therefore, the C. C. Williams Wastewater Treatment Facility processes\r\nare subject to Program 2 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the C. C. Williams facility located at\r\n1600 Yeend Street in Mobile, Alabama. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for treated wastewater,\r\nwith the facility storing approximately twelve (12) one-ton cylinders containing chlorine under\r\nnormal operating conditions. In addition to chlorine cylinders, there are six (6) one-ton cylinders of\r\nsulfur dioxide, used to remove free chlorine residuals from the treated wastewater, stored on-site.\r\nAs stated above, chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide\r\nis used for the dechlorination of the wastewater effluent after chlorination and before discharge.\r\nThe C.
