Pixley Cogen Partners will be following these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis document was developed for the Facility located at 11704 Road 120, Calgren Renewable Fuels,\n\nPixley, CA 93256 in an effort to fulfill criteria of the RMP standard, as required by Section 112(r) of the\n\nClean Air Act and regulated by 40 CFR, Part 68.\n\nUnder the accidental release provisions of the Clean Air Act, regulated sources are required to conduct\n\nhazard assessments, review off-site consequence analyses and develop a risk management plan. The\n\nhazard assessment discusses off-site consequences for a Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative\n\nRelease Scenario (ARS) of the regulated substances(s) at this Facility. From the subsequent analyses\n\nof the scenario(s), accident prevention programs will be reviewed, revised, and implemented.\n\nEmergency response programs will also be reviewed/enhanced in an effort to minimize the impact of\n\nthe potential consequences resulting from an accidental release of regulated substances in the covered\n\nprocess.\n\nThere are two primary purposes of the development of the Section 112(r) regulations, paraphrasing the\n\nintents of the U.S. Congress and EPA:\n\n1. To encourage sources to reduce the probability and severity of accidental releases\n\nhaving the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment\n\n2. To stimulate a dialogue between industry and the public to improve accident prevention\n\nand emergency response\n\nThe RMP standard applies to facilities that store greater than a threshold quantity of a regulated\n\nsubstance in a process at any one time.

Therefore, EPA's RMP applies. Toxic (ammonia) is\n\nthe only substances in the Facility's current chemical usage inventory, which would be present in\n\nquantities above the TQ limits set by the EPA, triggering the requirement for submitting this RMP.\n\nProgram Level Determination\n\nDetermining which program level the Facility is subject to within the RMP Guidelines requires\n\ndevelopment of a WCS and/or Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) and a review of the Facility's\n\naccident history with respect to the covered process for the previous five years.\n\nCalgren Renewable Fuels is not eligible for Program 1 because the distance to hazardous endpoint\n\nderived in the WCS includes public receptors. Also, Calgren Renewable Fuels process involving toxic\n\n(ammonia) is subject to OSHA's PSM Program requirements. Therefore, Calgren Renewable Fuels\n\nhas a \"Program 3\" process involving toxic (ammonia).\n\nPage 6\n\n \n\nHazard Assessment Elements\n\nThe next step for RMP development is to conduct the hazard assessment. The essential elements of\n\nthis assessment are as follows:\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nOff-site consequence analysis parameters (discussed in worst-case and alternative\n\nrelease scenarios)\n\nWCS analysis (completed in subsequent section of this document)\n\nARS analysis (one for each toxic chemical, completed in subsequent section of this\n\ndocument)\n\nDefining off-site impacts on population. Population estimates and identification of major\n\npublic receptors (i.e., schools, hospitals, other businesses, public roads)\n\nDefining off-site impacts on the environment.
