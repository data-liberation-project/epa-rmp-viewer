A PHA results in action items (findings/recommendations) that identify and address perceived potential hazards.  The action items are prioritized for management and employee resolution utilizing the scheme below:\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex additionally uses an Independent Protection Layer (IPL) Analysis methodology (commonly referred to as Layers of Protection Analysis or LOPA) to integrate process risk management into a unified, comprehensive program and identify Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in accordance with ANSI/ISA S84.01-1996 and IEC 61511.  \n\nIPLs can be viewed as \u00bflines of defense\u00bf against a potential incident.  IPLs often decrease the frequency of the potential incident.  Independent Protection Layers (IPLs) are systems used to mitigate serious environmental and process safety risk, identified during the process hazard analysis.  IPLs include specific and identified standard operating procedures, alarms with operator response, safety instrumented systems, emergency shutdown systems, and protective devices.\n\nIPL Analysis provides the risk assessment methodology for the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) is an integral part of the PSM program. Action items are managed and tracked to completion.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOP) provide clear instructions for the safe operations and control of the process and associated equipment.  SOP's are readily accessible to operations personnel in the control rooms and all other employees via the electronic delivery system.  The SOP's address various phases of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations; emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and subsequent startup.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection.\n\nRelease detection system connected to a plant-wide Emergency Alarm System.\n\nRelease Containment/Control.\n\nPeriodic inspection of process equipment.\n\nInspections by Operators each shift.\n\nRoutine leak detection and repair program for all system components.\n\nRemotely activated valves to isolate and limit release.\n\nEmergency equipment shutdown systems that are activated automatically, locally or remotely.\n\nDiked and sloped area with sump for spill containment.\n\nRelief devices to prevent system overpressure.\n\nAutomatic overfill prevention instrumentation.\n\nSpecialized \"excess flow\" valves to restrict release.\n\nState-of-the-art release prevention devices for pumps.\n\nProcess Relief Valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate releases.\n\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\nRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for"

Pasadena Plastics Complex has several written documents, which detail the actions to be taken in response to an unwanted release of a highly hazardous chemical.  General Plant Safety Rules provide basic instructions to employees for reporting and responding to an emergency.  The Pasadena Plastics Complex Emergency Procedures Manual and the Emergency Action Plan further provide detailed instructions and information utilized by essential personnel with regard to the emergency planning and response systems that are implemented at Pasadena Plastics Complex. \n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response Plan is developed and updated by a cross-section of plant personnel under the direction of the Safety Department.  A significant part of the Emergency Planning and Response Plan is the Pasadena Plastics Complex Emergency Response Team.  This team pr"

Membership requires participation in a rigorous training and qualification program.  Once qualified, each team member is expected to respond to emergency alarms while at work or if called out after their normal work shift.\n\nThe program consists of procedures for responding to various emergencies, including a small incidental emergency, a zone or complex-wide emergency, an external emergency, a hurricane or severe weather emergency, and a bomb threat.  The Incident Command System (ICS) is utilized to manage all emergency response situations.  The Pasadena Plastics Complex Emergency Response Team, a volunteer group of trained employees, responds to all plant emergencies to help minimize loss of like, property and to provide emergency medical care to the injured.  Trained Emergency Responders are onsite 24 hours per day.  \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex is divided into seven zones; all other areas are considered Outside Zones.  The zones are further divided into Affected Zones and Un-affected Zones depending upon the location and nature of the incident.  The Emergency Alarm System is designed to make either an Alarm or Announcement Tone followed by a voice message in the event of an incident.  The Emergency Alarm System is maintained to help response personnel or personnel working in either the Affected, Un-affected or Outside Zone determine the appropriate actions specified in the Emergency Action Plan.  Other communication tools include two-way radios and pagers.  \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), which is an organization of companies, and agencies that are prepared to handle their own normal emergencies, but are also prepared to lend emergency assistance to other members when it is requested.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is also involved with CAER (Co"
