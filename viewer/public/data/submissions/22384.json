An alarm would sound notifying the plant operation personnel about the leak, they would then call the appropriate authorities.\nAll Plant personnel are instructed on the procedure to use in the unlikely event of a chlorine leak.  Telephone numbers and procedures are posted and training is ongoing. \n\nWe have had no accidental chlorine releases in the past five years.\n\nAll our plant personnel are trained on responding to a chlorine release.  We have coordinated this procedure with the City of Lorain HazMat unit.  The HazMat unit trains on responding to chlorine cylinder leaks at the plant.  All plant personnel are trained on using the chlorine B kit, for repairing cylinder leaks.  They are also trained on the procedure used in dealing with a release of chlorine.  Personnel are constantly trained on the use of the chlorine B kit, use of air packs.  They attend chlorine safety workshops, CPR, first aid and safety workshops and classes.  Literature is available for them to review procedures. \n\nWe are starting to have more classroom training for all employees regarding plant safety and chlorine handling.\n\nWe constantly review our procedures and policies regarding chlorine and chlorine discharges.

Lorain takes water from Lake Erie and treats it and pumps finished drinking water to over 71,000 customers and businesses.  Chlorine is used in this process to disinfect the water. \n\nChlorine is stored in ton cylinders.  The chlorine inventory varies from less than 4 tons to 11 tons.     \n\nWe are dedicated to plant safety and are constantly striving to increase our personnel's knowledge of plant safety.  We are constantly updating our contingency plan to ensure the safest possible plans are in place in the unlikely event of a chemical mishap.\n\nWe have the latest Chlorine detection devices in place to detect a chlorine leak.  Our chlorine detection system has audio alarms.  The latest feed equipment is in place and is constantly being monitored by a computer system.  All supervisors and plant personnel review our contingency plan annually.  \n\nThe management of the Water Plant is committed to plant safety.  We have monthly drills with all plant personnel.  These drills include:  \n1)\tUse of air packs\n2)\tUse of Chlorine B kit\n3)\tSafety inspections of the chlorine feed system \n4)\tWhat to do in the unlikely event of an chlorine leak\n5)\tReview of HazMat callout procedure.\n\nAnnually we have:\n\n1)\tChlorine safety workshops attended by plant personnel\n2)\tTesting of Chlorine safety knowledge for all personnel\n3)\tCPR and first aid classes\n4)\tBooks and videos on chlorine safety\n\n\nA worst-case process hazard analysis has been performed with the following worst-case scenario:\n\nA rupture in the one-ton chlorine cylinder would be limited to a maximum of 2000 lbs. of chlorine released, with a discharge rate of 200lb/min.  The municipal boat docks would be affected.  The distance to endpoint would be 0.9 miles with a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour.   \n\nThe chlorine detectors will detect a leak and an alarm would"
