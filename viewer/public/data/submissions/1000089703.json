To meet this commitment, we have established systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper handling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances.  This program has been designed to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.   \n\n\n\nWateree Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs.  This regulation is also referred to as \"the RMP rule\".  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at Wateree Station.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \n\n\n\nWateree Station is the largest fossil plant in the Dominion Energy South Carolina (DESC) system.  The plant generates 700 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in two identical generating units.  Wateree Station's Unit 1 began commercial operation in 1970, and Uni"

      "SummaryText": "t 2 began operation in 1971.  To comply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, DESC had to reduce 85% of the total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emitted system-wide by May, 2004.  After exhaustive studies, DESC determined that Wateree Station would install a Selective Catalytic Reduction Reactor (SCR) for each of Wateree Station's generating units.  Inside each SCR, anhydrous ammonia is sprayed into the exit gas as it leaves the boiler and then the gas is processed through a series of ceramic plates (referred to as catalyst), converting the NOx into nitrogen (an inert gas) and water vapor.  Design engineering indicated the need to install two 60,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to support operation of the SCRs.  The SCRs are operated year-round.\n\n\n\nThe Wateree Station Risk Management Program consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1.    A hazard assessment to identify (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical Accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n  \n\n2.    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule (see Section 3 of this executive summary); and\n\n\n\n3.    An emergency response program to provide guidance to the plant for responding to Accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule (see Section 5 of this executive summary).\n\n\n\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Wateree Station's RMP covered system is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact, a comprehensive safety program exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONSIDERATIONS\n\n\n\nLimiting the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule:\n\n\n\nDESC did perform a thorough evaluation before selecting a pollution control technology that uses a hazardous substance regulated by the RMP "

The potential for the hazardous substance to affect individuals and the environment has been considered, and DESC has taken the appropriate steps to address the hazards.\n\n\n\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used:\n\n\n\nWhen a regulated substance is used, the equipment that contains it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  All applicable federal, state, corporate, and industry standards are strictly adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs:\n\n\n\nWateree Station's main objective is to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from occurring.  In the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental releases quickly, assess the severity of a release and respond to mitigate and stop the release.  Coordination with the county's Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) is crucial to protect the health and safety of the surrounding community.  Emergency planning efforts have been performed with Richland County Emergency Services, and DESC will continue to work closely with them.  In addition, the LEPCs for the adjacent communities (Sumter County and Calhoun County) have been informed.  In short, actions have been taken to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of a release on our employees and the community.\n\n\n\nThe DESC safety program consists of several elements, many of which are beyond what is\n\nrequired by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan executive summary is written to describe only those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule for Wateree Station.\n\n\n\n\n\nELEMENTS\n\n\n\n1.

This process safety information is available to our employees and contractors, as well.\n\n\n\n3.1.2   Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis of the anhydrous ammonia process was performed and will be periodically updated to identify process hazards, as well as to establish recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the RMP covered process.  A multidisciplinary team was assembled to analyze the hazards of the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling process.  This team includes personnel with engineering / process operating experience and a leader with experience in performing Process Hazard Analyses.  The team systematically addressed the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the anhydrous ammonia system.  The team then prepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the system, (b) the properties and hazards of anhydrous ammonia, and (c) a detailed review of the operating procedures and safe work practices.
