      "SummaryText": "Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals, LLC (KMLT) Argo Terminal is a chemicals and petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility. Argo Terminal operates two (2) processes for which the US Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan (RMP) is applicable:\n\t\t\t\n1. The Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) Storage and Distribution Process, and\n2. The Butane Blending Process\n \nThe below briefly summarizes some of the policies KMLT has in place to ensure the processes are operated in a safe and responsible manner:\n \n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe VAM Storage and Distribution Process and the Butane Blending Process were both designed in accordance with Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) with emphasis placed on release prevention and mitigation measures. In addition, KMLT has developed a written program to ensure continued compliance with the RMP Program Level 2 and 3 requirements. Examples of such programs include a management of change protocol, a mechanical integrity program and preventative maintenance plans for all critical equipment, hot work procedures and permits, operating procedures, employee and contractor training, an incident investigation protocol, and annual compliance audits. KMLT adheres to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nArgo Terminal maintains a written emergency response program that complies with EPA, US Coast Guard, US Department of Transportation (US DOT), Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) requirements.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "room temperature, to both retail and wholesale customers.  VAM is used as a raw material for manufacturing polyvinyl resins, such as those used in latex paints, paper coating, adhesives, textile finishing and safety glass inter-layers. VAM is identified as a toxic liquid in the RMP rule. VAM is received by railcar, stored in one atmospheric storage tank, and distributed through truck. VAM operations at Argo Terminal only involve storage and transfer; no chemical reactions take place.\n\nButane\nArgo Terminal receives butane by truck, stores butane on one horizontal pressure vessel, and blends butane into gasoline as it is beling loaded onto trucks for distribution. Butane is identified as a flammable gas (specifically, a liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]) in the RMP rule. KMLT owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending Process.  Energy Transfer owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending Process.  Energy Transfer and KMLT each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System.   Energy Transfer controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  KMLT oversees the unloading of butane trucks into both storage vessels and conducts routine visual inspections.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n \nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable API and NFPA standards.  All affected employees have been thoroughly trained in accordance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nFive-Year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases of VAM or butane in the past five years that have had or could have had an adverse impact on the community.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nArgo Terminal's written emergency response prog"
