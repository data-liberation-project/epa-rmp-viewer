      "SummaryText": "The City of Vallejo is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant under U.S. EPA RMP regulations and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations due to the facility's use and storage of up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine.  The RMP is subject to Program 3 guidelines because the worst-case release scenario endpoint distance for chlorine exceeds the distance to the nearest public receptor and the quantity of chlorine utilized is sufficient to make the facility subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations administered by U.S. OSHA.  The facility's RMP consists of an offsite consequence analysis based on the U.S. EPA guidance document and computational modeling, procedures for accidental release reporting, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nChlorine is added to surface water and well water treated at the facility in order to ensure purity of the drinking water and to meet California Department of Health Surfaces water treatment regulations by accomplishing the disinfection of any pathogens that might be present in the water supply.  The present chlorination system installed at Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant was designed in 1992 by John Corollo Engineers in accordance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, federal, state, and local design regulations and codes, and industry-specific design codes and standards.  The system is designed such that all chlorine is conveyed from the storage cylinders under vacuum pressure created by water flowing through an injector. In the type of chlorination system used at the facility, all chlorine is conveyed under vacuum once it passes the cylinder headers.  This design greatly enhances the overall safety of the system because its check valves and regulator valves will not permit chlorine to be conveyed if the vacuum is lost, as would be the case under most possible failure scenarios"

Up to six additional one-ton cylinders may be stored in the chlorine room, making the maximum total chlorine inventory 24,000 pounds.  \n\nAs a safeguard against the consequences that may occur due to a chlorine release, a chlorine vapor recovery system is installed that is designed to prevent a significant release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  The vapor recovery system automatically activates when a chlorine leak is detected (>1 ppm), and will remain activated until the detector senses an acceptable vapor level within the Chlorine and Ammonia Building.  The system is rated to reduce the chlorine concentration of air released to the atmosphere such that ground-level chlorine concentrations will not exceed 3 ppm, the level of concern used for the offsite consequence analysis of the RMP.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant as part of developing the facility's PSM.  The PHA is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  The PHA focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process.  These considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure points or failure modes of a process.  When hazard scenarios are identified, existing or proposed designs and operations are assessed to determine if appropriate engineering and administrative controls are in place.  If the current level of protection is determined insufficient, recommendations are made to eliminate and mitigate the scenarios.\n\nIn order to provide a thorough analysis as specific as possible to the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant, the Hazards and Operability Analysis (HazOp) method, incorporating the guide-word approach, was selected f"

The HazOp Study was conducted on May 5, 1999 by a HazOp Team consisting of two employees of Block Environmental Services, with expertise in the HazOp process, and eight members of the City's staff, with collective expertise in the engineering, management, operations, maintenance, and health and safety for the City's water treatment facilities.  \n\nThe PHA also included a seismic review to determine whether the facility and equipment are designed and installed sufficiently to withstand impacts from expected seismic events.  In addition, risks posed by the date change to the year 2000 (Y2K) and possible computer system complications were also assessed as part of the PHA.  Several other external events that might impact the chlorination system were also examined, including fire, power failure, sabotage, flooding, and tornado.\n\nIn general, the HazOp team concluded that engineering controls, safety systems, and procedures in place at the facility achieve the lowest risk practicable for all deviations identified, based on the implementation of two recommended additions to the standard operating procedures, which is slated for July, 1999.  Because the flow of vapor chlorine in most of the system relies on vacuum pressure created by the chlorine injectors, releases from most anticipated failure scenarios will necessarily be limited because regulator valves will automatically close upon the loss of vacuum pressure that would accompany a release.  The exception is the storage cylinder and header portion of the system, in which chlorine is conveyed under positive pressure.  Although failure leading to release in this portion of the system is not as likely as from the vacuum portion, potential chlorine releases would be of a much greater magnitude.  Therefore, the type of release determined to pose the greatest risk is a breakage of the cylinder valve or flexible connector during cylinder changeover.\n\nThe Assistant Water Superintendent is assigned overall responsibi"

The Senior Treatment Plant Operator will implement most of these elements, although specific tasks may be delegated to facility operators and maintenance personnel.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis portion of the RMP involves developing and modeling a worst-case and an alternative theoretical release scenario to estimate the impact an accidental release may have on the public and environment in the surrounding area.  The worst-case release assumes that the maximum amount of chlorine ever held in a single vessel at the facility is released into the atmosphere during meteorological conditions least conducive to expedient dilution of the released gas.  It is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The alternative scenario was selected based on the PHA conducted for the facility.  It is both a more likely potential release scenario and of sufficient magnitude to reach receptors offsite.   For the alternative release scenario, more representative, site-specific average daily atmospheric conditions are assumed.  OCA data reported for the RMP is based on data provided in Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, published by U.S. EPA in October of 1998.  The toxic endpoint to be used for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the maximum airborne concentration that most individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms. \n\nThe worst-case release is predicted to reach the toxic endpoint at a distance of 1.3 miles from the facility.  Although the width of the area affected by chlorine concentrations of this magnitude, or footprint, is limited and will only extend downwind from the source, a circle with a 1.3 mile ra"

There are nine schools, one hospital, six parks, one golf course, one cultural center, one community center, and one amusement/theme park within this radius.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen was identified in the PHA as posing the greatest risk (i.e. highest likelihood of occurrence and severest consequences) out of several release scenarios considered.  It consists of a breakage of the cylinder valve during cylinder changeover due to an operator applying excessive force to the valve in attempting to open it.  The active mitigation provided by the vapor recovery system installed at the Plant must be ignored for the analysis because if it functions as designed, the release would not extend offsite above the endpoint, as required by the regulations.  Taking into account passive mitigation provided by the enclosure of the chlorine room, it is conservatively estimated that 13.3 pounds-per-minute of chlorine is released to the atmosphere over two minutes under such a scenario.  The endpoint for this release extends 0.1 miles from the facility.  Using interpolation of 1990 census block group data, it is estimated that 140 people live within this radius (the same method could not be used for the worst-case release due to its magnitude).  Only one park, and no other public receptors, is located within the alternative scenario endpoint distance.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nIdentifying these potential receptors is only an indication that they could be adversely affected by such a release.
