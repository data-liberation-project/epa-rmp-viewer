To insure safe operation and release prevention at Club Chef, Covington, KY., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.   To insure proper response to emergency situations, Club Chef, Covington, KY., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations' Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Club Chef has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Club Chef uses RETA to train all operators.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team will be provided by the Covington, Kentucky Fire Department's Hazmat Unit.  This response plan was reviewed by the Director of Public Safety, Homeland Security and Emergency Management. This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).
