      "SummaryText": "   It is the policy of Fowler Equity Exchange to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Meade County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n   This facility is a farmer cooperative.  We store and sell grain and other ag products related to the public.  We sell Propane for heating and irrigation purposes and Anhydrous Ammonia for fertilizing purposes.  Storage consists of two 18,000 gallon propane and two 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks and associated piping and valves.\n   Our worst-case scenario for propane is failure of one 18,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is .5 miles.  There are numerous private homes within the disance to the endpoint, with a total estimated population of 600 people.  Our worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is a gas release with the endpoint being 2.5 miles.  Again approximately 600 to 650 people in that area.\n   This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane and anhydrous ammonia systems were designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with federal and state law.\n   We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n   In the event of an emergency involving our propane or anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Meade County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department members and the fire department members have inspected our facilities.\n   We have no changes planned to improve safety."
