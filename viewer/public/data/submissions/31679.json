The City of Flagler Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is required to provide disinfection to the treated wastewater effluent. Following disinfection of the treated wastewater, the chlorine is removed from the water with sulfer dioxide prior to discharge.   Chlorine gas is used to achieve the level of disinfection required under state and federal regulations.  Chlorine is considered a toxic substance by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and because quantities above the 2,500 pound threshold limit are stored on-site, a Risk Management Program (RPM) is required.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to on-site personnel, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of theCity of Flagler Beach to adhere to all application federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety demands on the manner in which chlorine is handled, The safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, safe handling procedures of the operators, and the training of personnel.  The City of Flagler Beach WWTP's emergency Responce Plan includes procedures for notification of the City of Flagler Beach Fire Department and through a mutual aid agreement throughout Flagler County, and Palm Coast Fire Department Hazmat Team.    2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.   The primary purpose of City of Flagler Beach WWTP is to provide a treated, disinfected, wastewater effluent that meets all Federal, state and local requirements prior to discharge.  The chlorine is received via truck from Brenntag Chemical Co. Access to the WWTP is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and other authorized personnel.  Chlorine is the only substance at this facility regulate"

The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenatio.    Worst-Case Scenatio -   Catastrophic failure of a 1-ton chlorine container due to corrosion, impact, or structural defects.  It is assumed that all 2,000 pounds of the chlorine is released as vapor, which is heavier than air, in 10-minutes as a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be 1.3 miles using to the EPA modle RMP*Comp.  The affected area would include residential areas with a population of 1,150 persons and Wadsworth Park..    Alternative Release Scenario - Tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of chlorine gas through the 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening.  It is assumed that a 317 pound total release of chlorine gas occurs with a maxium average sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute for a 60 minute duration.  The distance to endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be 0.1 miles using the EPA modle RMP*Comp.  The affected area would include a residential area with the population of two persons.  Prior to acceptance of the 1-ton chlorine containers, each container is inspected for visual defects that may cause an accidental release.  The chlorination system operates under vacuum pressure and is inspected daily.   4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.  This facility compilies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and is operated in accordance with recommendations from American Water Works Association and federal and state codes and regulations.   5.

The changes that have occured since the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) meeting held on May 20, 2002 include the development of a standard operating procedure (SOP) for daily and emergency chlorine handling.  In addition, all WWTP personnel along with Flagler Beach Fire Department personnel received handling and safety training from Brenntag Chemical Co. In April of 2003."
