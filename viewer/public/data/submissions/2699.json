If an accidential release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the Montevideo Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery \nto the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 288,400 lbs. in one 26,000 and one 30,000 gallon  tank.  The maximun quanity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case senerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank  capacity, as limited by design standards.   \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be .81 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provissions of \"Safety Requirements for the Starage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Starage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in th"
