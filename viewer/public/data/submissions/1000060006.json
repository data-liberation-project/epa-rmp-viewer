Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Warmerdam Packing has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Warmerdam Packing, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Warmerdam Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration         Anhydrous Ammonia                36,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to me"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following: (4) Rooms (2) Precool Rooms (1) CA Hallway (1) Loading Dock (7) CA Rooms (4) Hydrocoolers.\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The cherry/peach hydrocoolers are equipped with water-cooling evaporators (bare coils) and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located in the CA Hallway (catwalk) to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to each machinery room.\n\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall or on the catwalk in the mezzanine. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liq"

Each sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area that provides two-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the west exterior wall of the east machinery room and on the east exterior wall of the west machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the ammonia diffusion tank. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Warmerdam Packing consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Warmerdam Packing is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nWarmerdam Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.

The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Warmerdam Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWarmerdam Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nWarmerdam Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR ?1910.119(n)\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 ?2765.1-2765.2\n\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR ?68.95\n\n- California Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4 ?2731\n\n- California \"Hazardous W"

Nevertheless, Warmerdam Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Warmerdam Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Warmerdam Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nWarmerdam Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using \n\nPSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Warmerdam Packing has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the fu"
