If an accidental release  should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire deparment, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFor the purpose of this summary, the primary activity at the facilit is the storage  and transfer of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed to farmers for the benifit of effective agronomy practices. The maximum quantity stored would be 53,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity reieved by truck is 41,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst cas release scenario would be the release of the total  contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 53,000 pounds which represents  the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint using an enviormental plume modeling device is .74 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on data recieved from industry experts is a realease from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .41 miles.\n\nOur facility has an excellent safety record and has had no reportable releases in the past five years that have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at our facility or to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOur employees have gone through and will continue to recieve training which meets or exceeds that required by various regulatory agencies including, OSHA, KDA, DOT and EPA.  We have emergency actions plans and have had emergency training for our employees in the unlikely event an accident would happen.\n\nW"
