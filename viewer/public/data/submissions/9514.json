      "SummaryText": "The President Street Water QualityControl  Plant( WQCP) has served the City of Savannah and a small portion of Chatham County since 1973. The President WQCP uses two (2) chemicals in its processes, Chlorine and Propane. The propane is used for combustion of the two bio- solid incinerators. The propane system is checked annually. There has never been a release from the propane tank or system. Any work to be performed on the system is done by outside contractor.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario\n\nA release of 30,000 gallons due to structual damage has been determine to be the worst case, although unlikely to happen, would effect a small portion of the population at .25 miles.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenairo\n\nA release of 100 gallons due to a leak in the fill line with no off site impact.\n\nTo ensure proper treatment of the plant discharge (effluent), chlorine is used for disinfection. The disinfection feed rates varies from 100 lbs. per day to 700 lbs. per day depending on the effluent quality and demand. Treatment of the plant effluent may be done using chlorine gas or liquid, currently chlorine gas is use for disinfection of the plant effluent. The chlorine is trucked in 2000 lbs. container. The chlorine system has several chlorine leak detectors. The chlorine leak detectors activates visual and audible alarms to alert operation personnel if a leak is detected.  \n\n    Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario, in terms of a major release of gas, has been determined to be a structual failure of a 2000 lbs chlorine cylinder. The likelihood of this happening is sligth. For the worst case scenario it is a requirement of the 40 CFR 68.25 for the largest full container on site to completely empty its contents within a 10 minute period.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of the worst case release scenario has been determine to be 5.7 miles from the President Street WQCP.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate release scenario has been determined to be a shearing off of a1/4 "

In accordance withthe OCA guidance the maximum leak duration of 60 minutes has been used.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of the alternate release scenario has been determine to be .7 miles from the President Street WQCP.\n\nTo reduce the risk and magnitude of potential releases, written procedures for the safe handling and operation of the chlorination system has been implemented. In addition, work performed on equipment subject to cause a release requires a minimum of two personnel. Personnel are also required to wear Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) throughout the course of work associated with the chlorination equipment. Any major work to be performed on the chlorination system is limited to day time only, to reduce the possibility of a chlorine release and to ensure sufficient personnel are immediately available should a release occur.\n\nTo date, there has been no chlorine release from the President Street WQCP.\n\nIn February, 1999  the President Street WQCP completed its program 2  Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The Risk Management Plan includes the following 14 components: 1) Introduction, 2) Employee Involement, 3)Process Safety, 4) Process Hazard Analysis, 5) Operating Procedures and Practices, 6) Employee Training, 7) Contractor Information, 8) Pre-Startup Safety, 9) Mechanical Integrity, 10) Non-routine Work Authorization, 11) Change Management, 12) Incident Investigaiton, 13) Emergency Preparedness, 14) Compliance Audits. The information provided within these components are not to be considered all - inclusive for every conceivable scenario. However, it is the intent of the plan to provide a organized approach to the safe operation of the chlorination system, by defining, understanding, operating, maintaining, reviewing and documenting. The Treatment Adminstrator has overall responsbility for ensuring that the Process Management Plan "

The Savannah Fire Department Haz-mat division has surveyed the chlorine system, storage area and the propane storage tanks. The  Haz-mat division location is about  five minutes away from the President Street WQCP.\n\nThere are no plans to make any changes in the RMP at this time,  reviewing and updating the RMP will be  ongoing."
