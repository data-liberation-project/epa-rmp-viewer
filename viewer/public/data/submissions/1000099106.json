DBA Voyant Beauty is\r\ncommitted to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees and the surrounding community. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (aerosol packaging) is designed, operated and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to prevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take\r\nin the event of a release.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: Accra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty, located at 2730 Middlebury\r\nStreet, Elkhart, Indiana, offers full service custom packaging for various consumer product industries, such as pharmaceutical, household, cosmetic, personal care, and automotive care. The products packaged for these industries consist of liquids, semi-liquid creams, lotions, and aerosols. Some of the types of products that Accra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty packages include: hair mousse, cooking sprays, household cleaners, tire cleaners, air fresheners, breath\r\nspray, etc. Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the containers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. The regulated chemicals used as propellants in the aerosol packaging process are:\r\n\r\nButane (CAS No. 106-97-8);\r\nDifluoroethane (CAS No. 75-37-6):\r\nDimethylether (Methyl ether) (CAS No. 115-10-6);\r\nIsobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5);\r\nPropane (CAS No. 74-98-6);\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following chemicals are not normally present at the facility, but may be utilized as propellants should product specifications require:\r\n\r\nPentane (CAS No. 109-66-0); and\r\nIsopentane (CAS No. 78-78-4).\r\n\r\nP"

DBA Voyant Beauty maintains a Process Safety Management program for its\r\naerosol packaging process operation and maintenance. The PSM program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the aerosol packaging process. Some of the safety measures that are in place to ensure the safety of Accra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty employees and the surrounding community include:\r\n\r\nGas dectection systems are installed in areas where there is a potential for hazardous levels of flammable gas to accumulate.\r\nState of the art explosion suppression systems have been installed in all areas where flammable gas is transferred to aerosol containers. These systems are designed to detect and extinguish an ignition before a catastrophic explosion can occur.\r\nAll storage tanks that store hazardous materials are inspected on a periodic basis.\r\nPeriodic inspections are performed to ensure that all process equipment is adequately grounded. This reduces the chance of hazardous static electricity discharge that could ignite flammable vapors.\r\nTankers are equipped with emergency shutdown capability, adding to the safety of the unloading process.\r\nPressure relief valves are installed on the storage tanks and piping systems.\r\nStandardized operating procedures are utilized for unloading and handling of flammable materials.\r\nVentilation systems are installed to prevent the accumulation of flammable vapors in processing areas.\r\nWater canons are installed near the propella"
