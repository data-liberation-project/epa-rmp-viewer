      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Burgess Norton Manufacturing Company (BN) facility located at 500 Western Avenue in Geneva, Illinois (the Facility), is a manufacturer of precision powder metal products for the automotive and outdoor power equipment industries. The Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site personnel, the community, contractors and the environment. To meet this commitment, systems have been established to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this Facility. One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, the only hazardous substance stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in heat treating operations at the Facility. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a liquid state in one pressurized 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank (AST) that holds up to 51,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The pressurized anhydrous ammonia AST is located outside along the west boundary of the Facility property. Ancillary piping connects the anhydrous ammonia AST to dissociator units and heat-treat furnaces located inside the production building. Ancillary piping contains less than 1 pound of anhydrous ammonia. Including AST and ancillary piping storage quantities, a maximum of 51,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site. The RMP applies to facilities that operate a process which involves a chemical stored onsite at or above specified threshold quantities (TQ) listed in 40 CFR 68.130. Anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) is listed with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds under 40 CFR 68.130. Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 68, the Facility is required to implement a RMP because anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in quantities equal to or greater tha"

      "SummaryText": "n the 10,000-pound RMP TQ listed for anhydrous ammonia in 40 CFR 68.130.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.10(d)(2), RMP Program 3 requirements apply to facilities that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements outlined under 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM standard applies to facilities that operate a process which involves a chemical stored onsite at or above specified threshold quantities listed in 29 CFR 1910.119, Appendix A. Anhydrous ammonia is listed with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds under Appendix A. Therefore, because anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds and is used as a gas in the heat treat process, the Facility is subject to PSM and RMP Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nStationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Facility is a stationary source that stores and uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7), a regulated substance (40 CFR 68.130, Table 3). Anhydrous ammonia is piped in a gaseous state to dissociator units where it is broken down to its elemental components, hydrogen and nitrogen, and used in the metal heat treat operations at the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the heat-treat furnaces to create a required atmosphere for metallurgical processes. Tanner Industries, Inc. (TI) owns the anhydrous ammonia AST system including the tank and outlet valves. BN is responsible for maintaining the pipe delivery system connecting the AST system to the dissociator units and heat treat furnaces. TI performs all maintenance activities on the AST system, not including surface painting. BN leases the tank and purchases anhydrous ammonia on a regular basis from TI. Consequently, TI is responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of the AST system and is also obligated to maintain compliance with environmental and safety requirements that apply to the AST system.

It is the Facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. The Facility is committed to the safety of workers, contractors, the public, as well as to the preservation of the environment. Additionally, measures necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of the substances regulated by 40 CFR 68 will be implemented. The measures include:\n\n\n\n1. Employee training in accidental release prevention and emergency response programs/measures\n\n2. Establishment of safety programs for Facility operations, design, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system\n\n3. Establishment of a hazard assessment process\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of the regulated substance, all efforts will be made to minimize and control the release to ensure worker safety and prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment. The facility is also committed to working with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and local fire department to ensure all emergency notification and response measures are effectively planned and executed.\n\n\n\nBoth active and passive mitigation systems have been developed and implemented at the facility to reduce the potential for adverse impacts to human health and the environment.

The alternative release is defined as a release that has potential off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nUsing U.S.EPA?s RMP*CompTM to determine the worst-case scenario, the calculated toxic vapor endpoint distance was based on the loss of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank over a ten minute time period, 51,400 pounds. The worst-case release toxic endpoint distance is estimated to be 1.2 miles.

Based on a tank hole 4-square inches in , the alternative release over a ten minute time period was 3,060 pounds. The alternative release toxic endpoint distance is estimated to be 0.6 miles.
