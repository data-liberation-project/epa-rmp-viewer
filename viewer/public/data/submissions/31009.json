We operate under our parent company, General Electric, policy for Safety, Health & Environment.  This policy states: \n\n\"GE is committed to achieving environmental, health and safety(EHS) excellence. This is a responsibility of management and\nemployees in all functions. GE will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business. Our programs must combine clear leadership by management, the participation of all employees and functions, and the use of appropriate technology in developing and distributing GE products and services.\n\nRequirements:\n? Comply with applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations.\n? Take appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, and to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment. Consider evolving industry practices, regulatory requirements and societal standards of care.\n? Assess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project. Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of GE?s products and services.\n? Eliminate unreasonable risks from GE?s facilities, products, services and activities.\n? To the extent reasonably practicable, reduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution, and conserve, recover and recycle materials.\n? Continue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of GE?s operational strategy.\"\n\nFacility Description And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGe Betz, Inc. manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals, primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers and cooling towers.  Most of our products are formulated by blending several raw materi"

Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5 gallon pails to 6000 gallon truckload quantities.  Similarly, our raw materials which we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\n\nThe GE Betz, Inc. - New Philadelphia Plant covers 14.7 acres of property, of which 3.1 acres is used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot or open lawn, or idle areas.  At the facility, cyclohexylamine is a chemical raw material stored onsite as a liquid in a bulk storage tank.  It acts as a corrosion inhibitor by neutralizing acids and elevating pH in steam condensate, which makes it particularly useful as a component of our product line and to our customers.  This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of operating procedures, processes for insuring proper training of employees who are involved in handling hazardous chemicals, preventive maintenance for key equipment to limit the potential for failures that could cause releases, processes for managing changes in the process and conducting incident investigations for any release events that may occur.  The prevention program also includes"

Also, we intend to evaluate the feasibility of additional fire protection equipment to service RMP regulated processes."
