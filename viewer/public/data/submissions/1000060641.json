This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane blending system including the Butane unloading area, four (4) 84,000 gallon butane storage vessels, pumps and all associated piping.\n\n\n\nHebert Station complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and Sunoco Logistics specifications.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the facility's policy to notify the Port Arthur Fire Department as well as the Jefferson County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (Southeast Texas EMS Ambulance Service) and Southeast Texas Medical Center.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Sunoco Logistics Hebert Trunk Station looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, the Port Arthur Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills which will involve potential LP releases. Additional actions include consolidating separate Facility inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
