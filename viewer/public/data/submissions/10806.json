      "SummaryText": "2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Keebler plant in Macon, Georgia is a producer of cookies and crackers.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this process is 311821.   \n\nKeebler uses only one regulated substance above threshold under 40 CFR 68: propane.   Propane is used as a stand-by fuel for the baking ovens.  The plant does use ammonia in a refrigeration system but the inventory is only 3,653 pounds.  Keebler has elected to undertake RMP development for ammonia as if the plant was subject to 40 CFR 68 for ammonia at the Program 3 level.  This was done to comply with the intent of the General Duty clause under Section 112 r of the Clean Air Act.\n\n2.1\tAMMONIA PROCESS\n\nThe Macon facility has one ammonia refrigeration process for the preservation of the food products.  The main components of the ammonia refrigeration process are: a high pressure receiver, one condenser, four liquid chillers, two scrape surface heat exchangers, nine air cooling evaporators, one ice machine, four compressors, one inter-cooler, one Vaporitor, and piping.  Piping throughout the plant is labeled ammonia.\n\nThe majority of the pressurized vessels for the ammonia system are located within the plant structure in the machine room.  Access to the machine room is limited to employees who have been certified in the plant's Ammonia Operator Training Program and authorized contractors.  Visitors are not allowed in the machine room unless the individual has been HAZMAT trained or is accompanied by a certified employee.\n\nThe ammonia system is continually monitored to ensure the system is operating within specified control limits.\n\nThe ammonia inventory is approximately 3,653 pounds.  The process does not exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68.    \n\n2.2\tPROPANE PROCESS\n\nThe facility has one propane process to provide stand-by fuel.  The main components of the propane process are: four 30,000 gallon water capacity stora"

The piping located outside of the plant is buried to prevent contact with heavy machinery and condensation in the propane lines.  The piping to the ovens through the plant is anchored to the ceiling and labeled propane.  \n\nThe propane storage tanks and pumps are surrounded by a locked chain link fence to prevent access by employees who are not trained on the use of the propane system.  The vaporizer is similarly contained within a locked fence area. A security camera monitors the propane system to ensure that unauthorized personnel do not have access to the process equipment. \n\nThe propane threshold for triggering applicability under 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The plant administratively limits the amount of propane stored in the four storage tanks to 83% of capacity.  The maximum quantity of propane stored in each of the four storage tanks is 104,580 pounds.  The maximum amount of propane stored onsite is 418,320 pounds. This exceeds the threshold limit, which results in the Macon Keebler plant being regulated under 40 CFR 68 as a Program 2 facility.\n\n 3\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n3.1\tAMMONIA WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  Three release scenarios are possible for an ammonia release: 1) gas, 2) gas-liquid, and 3) liquid. \n\n3.1.1\tWorst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe EPA definition of the worst-case release is a failure of the largest tank, causing the release of the entire contents of the tank.  The worst-case release for the ammonia system would result from a puncture in the liquid portion of the high pressure receiver located in the machine room.  The machine room is located at the south end of the plant.  The total q"

      "SummaryText": "uantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 3,653 pounds.  It is assumed that all 3,653 pounds is released in 10 minutes.  Mitigation by the machine room enclosure is assumed per EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November, 1998).  Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n3.1.2\tAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The alternative release scenario is an ammonia release from a < inch hole in a high pressure pipe on a pump.  The release occurs near ground level as a horizontal jet release.  There are no applicable administrative controls.  Active mitigation of the release is human intervention (the system is shut down approximately 10 minutes from the start of the release). As with the worst-case scenario, mitigation by the enclosure is assumed.  Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n3.2\tPROPANE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nPropane is a flammable regulated substance capable of causing off-site consequences in the event of an accidental release.  Several release scenarios are possible including vapor cloud fires (flash fires), a pool fire with radiant heat effects, boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) leading to a fireball producing intense heat, a vapor cloud explosion, and a jet fire from a hole in a tank. \n\n\n\n\n3.2.1\tWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA definition of the worst-case release is a failure of the largest storage tank, causing the release of the entire contents of the tank.

The system was originally designed and constructed in 1953.  The system was modified in 1972 to increase flow capacity and in 1985 when the vaporizer was replaced.  The original system and later modifications were designed in accordance with the NFPA-58 code. The plant conducts inspections during operation of the propane system to ensure the system is intact and operating correctly. An outside propane contractor conducts an annual inspection of the propane system.  During these inspections the contractor notifies the plant of any deviations from the NFPA code and the plant corrects these deviations prior to the next inspection. The plant inspections during propane system operations in conjunction with the contractor's annual inspections and upgrades ensure that the worst-case and alternative scenarios have a minimal chance of occurring.\n\nThe plant has developed a prevention program for propane to meet the Program 2 requirements of the RMP rule.  The prevention program was written to be in compliance with 40 CFR 68, to ensure the safety of the employees, and to ensure the safety of the surrounding community. Keebler developed a training program for the propane system personnel.  The program discusses: (1) the potential hazards associated with propane, (2) the proper operating and maintenance procedures for the propane system, and (3) certification of employees for operation of the propane system.
