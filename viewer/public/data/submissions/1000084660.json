Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Olathe Fire Department, who provide our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one extremely hazardous substance present at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management Planning regulations. That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements is approximately 17,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention ar"

Company employees and contractors are urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements for the ammonia refrigeration system. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the implementation of the RMP regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. gathered all required process safety information prior to conducting a comprehensive process hazard analysis. The process safety information is documented in the PSM/RMP release prevention program for all refrigeration equipment and ancillary systems. The information is documentation to assure recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices for this process meets the industry standards.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. uses the What-If Checklist method of Process Hazard Analysis to identify and correct any issues that can affect the safety and/or mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A team of personnel representing engineering, construction, operations, safety, management and labor convene at least every 5 years to complete or revise the Process Hazard Analysis.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Sysco Kansas City, Inc. has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the ammonia refrigeration system. Contractors are also trained regarding the procedures for emergency notification, evacuation and employee accountability, should an accidental release of Ammonia (anhydrous) occur.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\n\n\nPre-startup reviews are initiated for new processes and when modifications of established processes are made as a regular practice at Sysco Kansas City, Inc. These reviews are conducted for process equipment, procedures, and facility changes to confirm construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. completes documented maintenance inspections and test on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, personnel who conduct, operate, or maintain the ammonia refrigeration system are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nHot Work Procedures:\n\n\n\nProcedures are in place at Sysco Kansas City, Inc. to insure that any hot work performed on or near the ammonia refrigeration system is approved by management a"
