This Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program. Accidental release prevention, and emergency response policies at the Chickasha Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.\n\nThe Chickasha WTP is located in Chickasha, Oklahoma, at or near Latitude N. 35.03.48 and Longitude W. 97.55.39. Chlorine is used to disinfect filtered water to make potable water for consumption for the City of Chickasha. The Chickasha facility treats on an average of 3 Million gallons a day (MGD) and is designed to treat up to 6 MGD. The facility will have the maximum of 16,000 lbs of Chlorine on site at any one time. The chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders, 2 on process and up to 6 on standby. Chlorine is drawn from the cylinders in a gaseous state.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders and feed systems are checked at least twice daily for leaks and feed rates. The preventative maintenance program has numerous operator and maintenance checks to ensure full and proper operation.\n\nA worst-case release scenario has been estimated, per EPA guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint. The worst-case release quantity, established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine held in a single vessel. Chickasha WTP worst-case is 1 Ton (2,000 lbs). In accordance with 40CFR section 68.25, chlorine gas released at a rate of 200 lbs a minute with a ten-minute release.\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measures were included for the worst-case release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "he EPA and Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO) Risk Management Program Guidance for Water treatment plants were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario, a distance of 1.3 miles. \n\nThe five-year accident history was evaluated to determine a likely alternative release scenario.  On January 22, 2001, an Operator was unplugging a valve, not using proper protective Equipment and not following company procedures. Operator closed valve manually.\n\n\n\nSevern Trent has developed accidental release response and prevention programs in the form of Risk Management Plans, Emergency Action Plans, Training with local emergency responders, Operator training, Operator inspection of the chlorine systems and preventative maintenance.\n\nSevern Trent will conduct training with local emergency responders (Chickasha Fire Department) more frequently. Operators will be trained and drills conducted as per the facilities RMP."
