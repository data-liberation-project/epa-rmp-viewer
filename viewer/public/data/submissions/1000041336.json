Operators are trained to call for outside assistance (911 and/or San Diego HazMat) to respond to a chlorine release.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Carlsbad Municipal Water District Maerkle Dam facility (5203 Sunny Creek Road, Carlsbad, California) is owned and operated by Carlsbad MWD (5950 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, California).  The facility is located approximately 1 mile north of the intersection of El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road.  The area surrounding the facility consists of the Maerkle reservoir, agricultural land, and a new residential development to the North.  Two very similar chlorine water treatment systems reside on the property: Lower Maerkle and Upper Maerkle.  The chlorine systems were constructed in 1995 accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Each process is located within a separate chain link fenced area with access through one gate only.\n\n\n\nThe Maerkle Dam Stations Facility is a 111 acre site that consists of a ten million gallon distribution reservoir, a 600 acre foot long-term storage impound, one pumping/disinfection facility (Lower Maerkle), one impound disinfection facility (Upper Maerkle), related pressure control stations, meter stations, and a caretaker's residence.  The site is normally unmanned (with the exception of the caretaker's residence).  Operators visit the site daily to ensure that the chlorine systems are operational.\n\n\n\n** Lower Maerkle Dam Station\n\n\n\nA maximum of five (5) one-ton containers of chlorine can be stored in the chlorine room at any one time.

The on-line containers are each placed on a digital scale that indicates the remaining weight of chlorine in each of the on-line one-ton containers to allow system operators to monitor usage and plan ahead for ordering more chlorine.  The chlorine system is operated entirely under vacuum conditions with a vacuum regulator attached to each of the one-ton container valves.  Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The flex tubing is connected to the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas (not liquid) is drawn out of the container.  \n\n \n\nChlorine gas is drawn from operating on-line one-ton container through an automatic switchover / vacuum regulator.  The automatic switchover regulator valves control which container is actively feeding chlorine to the vacuum regulator.  A vacuum (negative pressure) is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line downstream of the vacuum regulator, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping from the line under vacuum.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum (downstream of the vacuum leak) will be drawn to the injection point and into solution.\n\n\n\nDownstream of the vacuum regulator, chlorine is fed to a combination of six manually-adjustable chlorinators located in an adjacent room.  The chlorine can be distributed to four independently-controlled processes: System 20, System 30, and System 40.  Each process feeds chlorine gas into solution at an injector where it is mixed with water.  System 20 is flow paced only - the chlorine feed rate is manually controlled at the rotameter.

Only two chlorinators are used at the Upper Maerkle Dam Station.  Prior to injection, the chlorine gas passes through a chlorine dioxide generator that used sodium hypochlorite as a reagent to create chlorine dioxide.

Much of the systems' safety is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern their operation.  For example, the Carlsbad MWD treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are four mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine gas detectors, 2) visual/audible alarms, 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system, and 4) halogen automatic shut-off valves.  \n\n\n\nThere are two chlorine detectors located in the chlorine room where one only provide a redundant displays located in the adjacent rotameter rooms at the Upper Maerkle Station and the Lower Maerkle Station.  At 1ppm, it activates an audible alarm and sends a call through the SCADA system to the Duty Operator's phone then to the backup Duty Operator.  At 3ppm, the audible and visual alarms are activated, the halogen valves are triggered to automatically close the one-ton container valve (via a motorized mount), the scrubber is activated, the ventilation system that continuously circulates the air in the chlorine building shuts off, and the SCADA system sends another message to the Duty Operator that the halogen valve was activated.  \n\n\n\nThe halogen valves consist of a motorized mechanism mounted on each vacuum regulator that is designed to close the ton container valve in the case of a chlorine leak detection.  There is also a battery which provides enough power to close the valve during a power loss.\n\n\n\nThe scrubber runs until the detector senses a 1 ppm chlorine concentration in the chlorine storage room; meaning it can only be manually shut off when the concentration is lower than 1 ppm.

Since the facility is normally unmanned, chlorine operators are typically the only personnel on site.  In case chlorine leak detection at the facility, the on-call (\"duty\") operator is alerted via SCADA system to operator's phone.  The duty operator alerts the MWD Supervisor and immediately responds to the alarm.
