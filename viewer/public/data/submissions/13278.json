      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\n EMP CO-OP Inc. is an agricultural retailer, which distributes fertilizer and chemicals to farmers.  Our clients reside in Allen and Paulding Counties.  Our regulated substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  This product is sold in the spring and early summer months.  The product is stored in an 18,000-gallon storage tank.  It is distributed to farmers by nurse tanks.  The farmer applies the anhydrous ammonia direct from the tank and injected directly into the soil.  \nOur plant has an emergency response plan, which contains at least 1.) Emergency escape procedures and emergency route assignments; 2.) Employee procedures for those who operate critical operations before evacuating; 3.) Procedures to account for all employees after the evacuation is complete; 4.) Description of rescue and medical duties for employees; 5.) Preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies to the respective agencies; and 6.) Names and job titles of persons who can be contacted for further information concerning the emergency response plan.  In addition to the emergency response plan, employees are trained annually on safety and handling of fertilizer and chemical materials.  \n     Our worst case scenario would be a leak in the storage tank.  Our facility has an 18,000-gallon tank, which is only filled to 85% of the tank capacity.  This scenario assumes that the tank would be filled and it would leak in ten minutes.  This leak would affect the rural area of Harrison Township in Paulding County, Ohio.  A small rural town called Payne would be affected in this scenario.  The affected area is a 2.13-mile radius from the storage tank.\n    Our alternative case scenario would be a rupture of a transfer hose from the storage tank to a nurse tank.  The transfer hose size in 2.0 inches and the duration of the leak would last for two minutes.  Employees are always present when transferring Anhydrous Ammonia.  Therefore, the leak would not last longer than two minutes.  Using the"

      "SummaryText": "DEGADIS model provided by The Fertilizer Institute, this scenario would affect a 1.18-mile radius from the storage tank. \nWe are proud to report that our plant has not had an accident in the last five years.  Through employee training and maintenance of our facility, we hope to continue this trend.  Our future plans are to continue on-going safety training of our employees\n\nEmergency Response Plan:\n\n The primary goals of any emergency response, in order of priority, should be to save lives, protect the environment, and minimize property damage. It is essential that those responding not only understanding the goals, but be prepared to respond in the most efficient and responsible way possible. Preparedness also includes knowing when the problem is beyond our organization capabilities, and to know when the risk of product or equipment recovery exceeds the item's value. The Emergency response plan provides 1.  A system of readiness accomplished by training people to act efficiently and with confidence in an emergency. 2.  Procedures for orderly transition from normal to emergency operation. 3.  A plan for coordination with community emergency response organizations before, during and after an emergency. 4.  A plan for delegation on emergency authority and responsibility. 5.  Procedures to prevent emergency situations from developing into disaster situation.  Not all elements of the Emergency Response Plan will be used in all emergency situations. The structure of the plan allows flexibility or phased reaction for each situation."
