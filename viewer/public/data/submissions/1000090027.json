This commitment is demonstrated through implementation of corporate policies and standards. Policies and standards that have been implemented include Standards for Safe Work Permitting, Isolation of Energy Sources, Hot Work, Confined Space Entry, Management of Change, Pre-start Up Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity. In addition to these corporate standards, the Harbor Beach facility has implemented facility specific policies to address specific facility situations. Process Hazard Analysis is completed using Risk Assessment Tool (RAST), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), and Reactive Chemicals Review process. The facility maintains an incident investigation policy.  This policy requires that all incidents that result in, or could potentially result in a release of a regulated substance, be investigated, documented, and appropriately addressed.\r\n\r\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe Site operates a chemical manufacturing process that uses fermentation to produce a pesticide active ingredient.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material and processing aid.  The anhydrous ammonia storage tank holds a theoretical maximum inventory of 102,000 pounds.                             \r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe facility currently complies with EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations. In addition, the facility maintains a Title V Renewable Operating Permit and complies with the Pesticides Active Ingredient Production MACT, 40 CFR 63 Subpart MMM Regulation. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good design practices and Engineering standards and maintains process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associa"
