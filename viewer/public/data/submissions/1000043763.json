This Risk Management Program as implemented will assist to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of chemical releases.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR Part 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDWU implements preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing programs to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and provide immediate corrective response to any accident.\n\nBachman WTP personnel are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the City of Dallas Police, City of Dallas Fire Department, the State and County Emergency Response Center, and Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Bachman WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Hazard Analysis as well as written safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. The City of Dallas verifies that all equipment used in the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes comply with applicable codes and standards and with industry accepted good engineering practices.\n\nThe Hazard Review (Process Hazard Analysis) completed for this Risk Management Plan (RMP) documents the process and the findings to minimize or eliminate hazards, to mitigate the consequences of hazards of "

The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a successful RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel. \n\nPersonnel have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in the workplace will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP. \n\nThe Bachman WTP chlorine and anhydrous ammonia system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, the Bachman WTP has had zero accidental releases. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan for the Bachman WTP includes the following elements:\n\n?    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\n\n?    Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures \n\n?    Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance\n\n?    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and main"

Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes\n\nCopies of emergency procedures are maintained at the WTP Head House Building. Specific Bachman WTP personnel are trained to take action in the event of a release and will attempt to control a release within their capability. In the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, maintenance personnel, or the Bachman HazMat Response Team, they would immediately notify the Fire Department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Bachman WTP planned changes to improve safety include: conducting additional chlorine/ammonia release drills with the Fire Department; conduct and document monthly safety briefings with employees; and conduct periodic review of personal protective equipment (PPE) maintenance [requirements follow Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 Safety Management System and DWU-PRO-063 Respiratory Protection Program], inspection, and testing with employees. DWU uses a certified International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001-Safety Management System, the latter which incorporates safety standards."
