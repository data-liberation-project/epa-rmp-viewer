Background\n\nGlasgow Water Company, located in Glasgow, Kentucky, operates the Lucas Water \n\nTreatment plant (WTP).  The facility is subject to EPA?s Risk Management Program \n\nin accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  The WTP provides \n\nthe City of Glasgow and surrounding areas with potable water for human \n\nconsumption.\n\n\n\n? Chemical Management Program\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a \n\nresponsible citizen very seriously.  Glasgow Water Company facilities are operated to \n\nprotect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize \n\nenvironmental impact.  Glasgow Water Company?s policy is to inspect, maintain and \n\noperate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous \n\nmaterials, and to train employees in prevention of accidents.\n\n\n\nGlasgow Water Company has developed and implemented Process Safety \n\nManagement (PSM) plans at each operations facility as part of an overall chemical \n\nmanagement program.  The program involves the Superintendents at each facility \n\nalong with the plant operators.\n\n\n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Lucas WTP has developed a PSM plan as part of the overall chemical \n\nmanagement program.  The program involves the Superintendent and all operators at \n\nthe facility.  Lucas WTP personnel also provide safety training to staff as part of the \n\naccidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n2) Description of Facility and the Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Lucas WTP is located on 1321 Narrows Road near Lucas, Kentucky \n\napproximately 10 miles southeast of Glasgow.  The Lucas WTP withdraws and treats \n\nwater from Barren Lake for distribution of potable water to the surrounding areas.\n\n\n\nThe Lucas WTP utilizes a Wallace & Tiernan vacuum operated, Automatic switchover, \n\ngaseous feed system.

Under \n\nnormal circumstances, two full containers and two containers in use are piped together and \n\nsituated on the scale apparatus and up to two full containers of chlorine are stored \n\nwithin the same room.  The maximum amount of chlorine on-site at one time would \n\nbe less than 12,000 pounds.  Currently, the feed rate for chlorine ranges from \n\napproximately 200 ? 500 pounds per day.\n\n\n\n3) Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe predicted worst-case release scenario for chlorine is a catastrophic release of one \n\n(full) chlorine container within the chlorination room.  This enclosure will limit the \n\ndispersion of both liquid and vapor to the atmosphere during a release.  For this \n\nscenario, 2,000 pounds of chlorine liquefied under pressure are assumed to be \n\nreleased in 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 air dispersion modeling \n\nsoftware, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is predicted to be 2.2 miles.  \n\n\n\nAs an input parameter for RMP*Comp the topography surrounding the WTP was \n\nconsidered ?rural?.  It should be noted that this parameter is not directly correlated to \n\npopulation density.  Rather, the topography surrounding the facility is characterized \n\nas either having many obstructions ? ?urban? or generally flat with few obstacles ? \n\n?rural?.  Because the WTP is located adjacent to the lake, the surface of the water is \n\nconsidered the dominant feature in the topography surrounding the facility (see \n\nSection 3.3).  For this reason, the topography is considered ?rural?.\n\n\n\nThis radius encompasses approximately 345 residences, and 1 recreation facility.  \n\nAssuming a population multiplier of 3.5 people per residence, this radius \n\nencompasses approximately 1,210 people.  The number of residences and other \n\npublic and environmental receptors associated with this radius was provided by \n\nGlasgow Water Company personne"

For this scenario, a lead \n\ngasket is not properly installed when the vacuum regulator assembly is leak tested. \n\nBefore the main valve to the cylinder can be closed, chlorine gas is released, \n\nforcing WTP personnel to evacuate the chlorination room.  The chlorine container continues\n\nto release chlorine gas for one hour until the release is mitigated by emergency \n\nresponders.\n\n\n\nThis release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 software by \n\nassuming that the temperature and pressure of the container at the time of the leak are \n\n77 degrees F and 113 pounds per square inch (psi).  The release was modeled as \n\ndischarge of gas from a 1/8 inch diameter hole (area = 0.0123 square inches) at the \n\nabove temp and pressure.  Off-site consequences analysis using RMP*Comp resulted \n\nin a radius of impact of 0.1 miles.  Visual inspection indicates that there is a \n\nrecreation area and 2 residences located within this radius, comprising a total \n\npopulation of 6 people.\n\n\n\nBecause the specific gravity of chlorine is 2.49 (air = 1.29), chlorine vapor is more \n\ndense than air.  As a result, chlorine vapor may collect and/or migrate along low-lying \n\nareas in and around the facility.  This is particularly important due to the fact that the \n\nchlorination room is located immediately adjacent to Barren Lake atop the steep bank \n\nof the lake.  A release of chlorine gas will tend to migrate down the steep bank and \n\ncollect on and/or migrate along the surface of the lake.  \n\n\n\nFurthermore, the floor drains within the chlorination room discharge along this steep \n\nbank.  This results in a ?short circuit? that would allow chlorine gas to travel directly \n\nfrom the floor drains in the chl"

However, the \n\nmigration of chlorine vapor in the event of an actual release will be highly dependent \n\nupon the atmospheric conditions and release scenario at that time of the release.\n\n\n\n5) General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Lucas WTP maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly \n\nHazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and \n\nSafety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The WTP also utilizes \n\npreventative maintenance programs for its system components.  The preventative \n\nmaintenance program for the chlorination system is conducted in conformance with \n\nmanufacturer?s recommendations.\n\n\n\n6) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidents within the last five years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n7) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Lucas WTP has implemented an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with \n\nOSHA PSM regulations.  The facility will rely on the Glasgow Fire Department to \n\nrespond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency \n\nsituation.  The written Emergency Action Plan contains specific information \n\nregarding evacuation and notification procedures in the event of a catastrophic \n\nchlorine release.\n\n\n\nThe Glasgow Fire Department has conducted a reconnaissance of the facility and \n\ntrained personnel are ready to respond if requested.\n\n\n\n8) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Lucas WTP is in the process of implementing safety improvements as \n\nrecommended in the Process Safety Management program.
