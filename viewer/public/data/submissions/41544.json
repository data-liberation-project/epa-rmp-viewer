The City remains committed to provide and/or exceed the necessary equipment and training, as required by all applicable federal and state regulations, for the safety and welfare of our employees and citizens. \n\nThe City Public Utilities Department has had a written emergency action plan, for this site, since the late 1980's. This re-submission and certification again demonstrates the City's desire to remain in compliance with EPA's Risk Management program requirements (40 CFR part 68). The primary focus of our emergency action program is for efficient communication to the Harrisonburg Fire Department HAZMAT Unit, who is extensively trained for response and repair of chlorine leaks.  \n\nB.) FACILITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe purpose of this chlorination facility is to disinfect and maintain a state-required chlorine residual in the public drinking water distribution system for the City of Harrisonburg.  Chlorine gas, liquefied by pressure in chemical supplier tanks, is received by trucks and stored at the site, as described below.  \n\nThe Tower Street Reservoir site stores up to a maximum of six 1-ton containers for supplemental chlorination of 21 million gallons of stored potable water.  Chlorination is achieved at this site by the use of V-Notch chlorinators. The chlorine building houses chlorine cylinders, (2) V-notch chlorinators and process safety equipment. The facility is normally unmanned, however, qualified personnel visit and inspect the facility daily to observe the process parameters and evaluate the credibility of any alarms.\n\nC.) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe City of Harrisonburg's Prevention Program has evolved over the past 30 years, with the guidance of the Virginia Health Department regulations, AWWA recommendations, E.P"

Personnel equipped with cellular telephones. \n\n15) Continue to develop written operational procedures, hazard review and program auditing.\n\n16) Random site perimeter observations day and night by the Harrisonburg Police Department.\n\n17) Increased random inspections initiated in harmony with the National Security Alert Levels (indicated by color-code system)\n\n\n\nPREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE:\n\n1) New gasket required with each cylinder change.  \n\n2) "

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThis facility has had NO accidental releases of chlorine, with offsite consequences, in the past 5 years.  Minor vapor leaks do occur occasionally, during cylinder change outs.  However, we have not experienced a release condition that would create a toxic endpoint offsite.  \n\nE.) THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based on timely notification of the Harrisonburg Fire Department, who staffs a Hazardous Material Response Team, consisting of trained HAZMAT specialists and technicians who have proper equipment for mitigating chlorine leaks from 150 pound cylinders to 1-ton containers. The Harrisonburg Fire Department is a member of the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Harrisonburg community has an active 911 and \"Reverse 911\" system. The \"Reverse 911\" system allows local emergency officials to notify area residents in the event of a chemical release or other emergency.\n\nSpecific Activities required of Public Utilities staff upon receipt of threat warning include:\n\n1) Contact the Superintendent of Water Treatment or the Pump Assets/Operations Manager to form a site characterization team\n\n2) Site team shall conduct a perimeter probing to monitor Cl2 source\n\nSpecific Activities required of Public Utilities staff upon confirmation of credible threat:\n\n1) Contact 911 for Haz-Mat assistance\n\n2) Contact National Response Center (1-800-424-8802) within 15 minutes\n\n3) Contact Local Emergency Planning Commission (1-540-564-3010) within 15 minutes\n\n4) Contact Virginia Department of Emergency Services (1-800-468-8892) within 15 minutes\n\n5) Refer to the \"Tower Street Reservoir Risk Management Plan\"\n\nMitigation shall be referred to Haz-Mat.\n\nF.)

The long-term capital outlay program targets replacement of both existing reservoirs at this site, with modern ground storage tanks. This endeavor could actually result in reducing the chlorine requirements at this site to a sodium hypochlorite disinfection system and/or the storage of gas chlorine below the regulated threshold quantity. The ultimate goal is to de-register this facility.\n\nOur recent Vulnerability Assessment, submitted to EPA in accordance with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act, PL 107-188), identifies existing and proposed countermeasures that enhance site security and thereby improve safety. The proposed countermeasures to be considered for funding in the future include:\n\n* Card Key Badge & Vehicular Gate \n\n* Ptz Camera at Reservoirs\n\n* Upgrade Fence at Reservoirs\n\n* SCADA Annunciation of CL2 Detection to WTP\n\nIn addition, we continue to review options with the Harrisonburg Fire Department and chemical suppliers to provide additional, more comprehensive training to the personnel responsible for chlorine facilities and emergency responses. \n\n\n\n\n\nm:\\engineering\\EPA RMP\\Tower St\\Exc-Sum.doc    Page 2\n\n\n\nCity of Harrisonburg\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTower Street Reservoir Site\n\nDecember 8, 2004\n\n\n\n\n\n"
