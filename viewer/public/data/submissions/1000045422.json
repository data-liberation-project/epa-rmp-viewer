      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\n\r\nThe Praxair Kingman, Arizona plant, which began operation in October 1990, is situated on 188 acres adjacent to Interstate 40 in Mohave County, Arizona.  The plant consists of the production area, Silane, Dichlorosilane and Trichlorosilane filling/recovery area, Ammonia purification and filling, liquid products filling (halocarbons), cylinder maintenance and repair shop, covered storage area and shipping dock and office area.  A separate building houses the maintenance department.  Pure products are repackaged (filled) from bulk containers into compressed gas cylinders.  Silane, Trichlorosilane, Dichlorosilane and Ammonia are examples.  Silane mixtures of gases are made and packaged on site.  Hydrogen is used as a purge gas, high-oxidation fuel source and as a mixture gas.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \r\n>Trichlorosilane - Semiconductor dopant and chemical vapor deposition\r\n>Anhydrous Ammonia - Semiconductor chemical vapor deposition\r\n>Dichlorosilane - Semiconductor dopant and chemical vapor deposition\r\n>Aqueous Ammonia - Anhydrous ammonia recovered in water solution.\r\n\r\nHydrogen - is used in the mixtures but the quantity of hydrogen is below the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\n\r\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilit"

Upon reaching certain thresholds set at or below American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) levels, alarms will sound throughout the plant prompting a site evacuation if necessary and resulting in the immediate and automatic shutdown of all gas production, valves, and transfer operations. In addition to the engineering controls mentioned above, administrative controls consisting of personnel attendance is conducted at preset locations within the site. Following a site evacuation, trained first responders from the Praxair LEAP program will be deployed to investigate and take appropriate action to mitigate any incident. An investigation is conducted following the incident with corrective action to prevent reoccurrence. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\n\r\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Praxair Kingman, Arizona location will be a responding facility as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to all incidents. Praxair has established a Local Emergency Assistance Program (LEAP) to provide emergency response expertise for the unique industrial gas products and equipment we handle. All LEAP employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually. In addition, Praxair has in place a detailed site and community emergency response plan that meets the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and EPA RMP 40 CFR 68.95. The community response plan has been developed in coordination with the Mohave County, Arizona Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for regulated toxics and the Golden Valley Fire Department for regulated flammables.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goa"
