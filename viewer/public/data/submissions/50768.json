      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary\nFor \nThe Dow Chemical Company \nLa Porte Site\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the La Porte Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all chemicals including regulated substances. If such an unforeseeable release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur primary activities encompass The Dow Chemical Company facility in La Porte, Texas, which is in the chemical manufacturing business.  The basic products manufactured at the site include Methylene Diphenyldiisocyanate based (MDI based) polymeric isocyanates, polyol systems, related polyurethane elastomers and foams.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility, which are involved in several uses. These substances include chlorine and isopentane.  Chlorine is used for cooling water treatment and isopentane is used for foam bun production.  \n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternate release scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the cooling water "

      "SummaryText": "treatment system.  In this scenario 2000 pounds of Chlorine gas liquefied by pressure is released at Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from cooling water treatment system of 600 pounds of Chlorine gas under neutral weather conditions.\n\nThe Foam Plant qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst case scenario for this process,      11,600 lb. of Isopentane is released.  A passive mitigation control, a blast wall, is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion, under worst case weather conditions. The distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe La Porte Site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the La Porte Site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe La Porte Site maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some examples of the records described are material safety data sheets, equipment specification sheets, and reactive chemical compatibility grids.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe La Porte Site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Dow comprehensive safety and loss prevention internal audit which"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 10/17/2006.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the La Porte Site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe La Porte Site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe La Porte Site carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the La Porte Site to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
