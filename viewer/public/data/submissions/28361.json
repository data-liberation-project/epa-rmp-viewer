Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, US Foodservice has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n1.1.    Commitment to Safety\n\nUS Foodservice is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1.    It is the policy of US Foodservice to:\n\n1.1.1.1    Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2    Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3    Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n1.1.1.4    Ensure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work in a saf"

Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3.    This facilities aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4.    US Foodservice has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process process.  It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.    The first duty of US Foodservice employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.    Facility Description\n\nUS Foodservice is a cold storage / distribution facility that receives and prepares the re-shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products to their end users.  Products are received and shipped via truck 24 hours a day, six days a week.\n\n1.2.1.

      "SummaryText": "and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.2.    Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System\". Approximately 12,400 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is contained and used in various vessels, compressors, piping, and evaporators used throughout the refrigeration process.  A single machine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery, vessels, piping and motor control centers..\n\n1.3.    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n1.3.1.    As stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1)the worst-case release scenario involves a failure within the process system. This scenario involves a vessel rupture that results in a total of 12,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia being released in a 10-minute period.  This release amount is based on the low temperature recirculator holding the process systems entire ammonia inventory of 12,400 pounds.  Although the recirculator is capable of holding a higher capacity of ammonia, there is not enough ammonia in the systems normal inventory to exceed the vessels total capacity. \n\n1.3.2.    The recirculator was selected for the worst case scenario because of the potential to hold the highest amount of anhydrous ammonia in one vessel that would create the largest endpoint, if released.\n\n1.3.3.    Considering the \"catastrophic\" possibility does exist for this vessel to release the entire contents, engineering and administrative controls incorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release. Upon failure of these controls, the only mitigation considered for this scenario was the machine room enclosure that surrounds the vessel. The accidental release of the ammonia would initially be into the machine room before escaping to the open atmosphere though various openings and ventilation in the room. \n\n1.3.4.    Using ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) the distance to the endpoint for such a release would be 2.0 miles.  The potential public and environmental receptor impacts f"

      "SummaryText": "or this release are discussed in the overall RMP PLan.\n\n\n1.4.    Alternate Case Release Scenario\n\n\n1.4.1.    The alternative release scenario involves the loss of anhydrous ammonia as a result of an overpressurization in one of the process system's vessels containing liquid ammonia. This condition causes a release through a safety relief valve installed on the vessel. Such a release would be vented through the relief valve collection header vent that opens to atmosphere on the machine room roof.\n\n1.4.2.     The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release, based on ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) is 0.1 miles.  The potential receptor impacts are discussed in the overall RMP PLan. \n\n1.4.3.    This alternate release scenario was selected based on the frequency of safety relief valve releases associated with ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\n\n1.5.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n1.5.1.    US Foodservice is equipped with an emergency warning system.  Alarms are placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the US Foodservice Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n1.5.2.    Plant personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and other various rules and regulations. \n\n1.5.3.    The Boca Raton District Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discuss emergency response coordination."
