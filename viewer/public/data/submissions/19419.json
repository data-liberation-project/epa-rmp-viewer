Conducting business in a manner that wins public confidence and meets the environmental and economic needs of the communities we serve is critical to our long-term success.  \n\nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities, as well as in the training or our employees.  Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have trained personnel who will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on our surrounding community.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe ARCO Los Angeles Refinery is located in the city of Carson, California.  The site occupies 630 acres and employs more than 850 people.  The refinery has to capacity to process approximately 265,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce a variety of petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and petroleum coke, as well as products such as propylene, natural gas liquids and other petrochemicals.  The facility also includes the Watson Cogeneration Unit, which is a joint venture between Atlantic Richfield Company and Southern California Edison.  The Cogeneration Unit burns natural gas to produce electricity, which is sold to the Edison grid.  Waste heat from the process is then used to supply steam to the refinery for process use.  \n\nThe refinery has seve"

The primary use of ammonia is in the air pollution control system for the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides.  It is also used for process corrosion control. \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nAmmonia Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe EPA-prescribed worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in a Program 3 process at the refinery is a catastrophic failure of the ammonia storage tank in the Cogeneration Unit.  Administrative controls are in place, which limit the storage volume in the tank to a maximum volume of 117,200 pounds.  In the EPA WCS, the entire contents of the tank are released over a 10-minute period.  Atypical and unfavorable weather conditions exist; there is no wind to help disperse the vapors.  Although there are numerous controls in place to prevent this type of catastrophic release and to minimize the consequences of such a release, per the EPA-prescribed methodology, none of these mitigation systems are considered in this release scenario.  Under these conditions, the maximum distance to the EPA endpoint of 200 ppm (parts per million) for this EPA WCS is 3.6 miles.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for ammonia is a hose failure during off-loading of a tanker truck to the Cogeneration storage tank.  With a two-inch hole in the loading hose, and assuming failure of all controls, the entire contents of one of the truck compartments are released in 10 minutes, during which time personnel mobilize a hazardous material response effort to shut down the equipment.  With the release of 24,750 pounds of ammonia, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in this ARS is 0.5 miles.\n\nFlammable Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe EPA-prescribed WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery"

Atypical and unfavorable weather conditions exist; there is no wind to help disperse the vapors.    Following the EPA-prescribed methodology for this scenario, the material vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this EPA WCS is 1.5 miles.  Although there are numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, per the EPA prescribed methodology, no credit is given for any mitigation measures in this scenario.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of butane from a transfer line during the offloading of a rail car to a refinery storage tank.  In this scenario, the hose uncouples, existing controls are assumed to fail, and butane is released to atmosphere.  The release is isolated and stopped within 20 minutes, during which time 142,000 pounds of butane (the contents of the railcar) are released.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.2 miles.  \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ARCO Los Angeles Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe ARCO Los Angeles Refinery provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

In addition, the refinery has a number of programs underway that address employee safety issues, including a comprehensive program for behavioral safety.  This program provides training for each employee to enable them to observe fellow employees in order to identify and correct behaviors that may lead to accident or injury.  Developed and managed by our employees, this peer review program is a well supported by our employees and is a fundamental part of our safety program.  Other ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in written programs maintained at the facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery maintains extensive documentation that is used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  This documentation addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response information is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) contained in Operating Manuals and Design Process Books.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains documentation th"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe refinery uses the HAZOP (hazard and operability) analysis method and other approved Process Hazard Analysis methods to perform these evaluations. \n\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents involving accidental release or potential for such, engineering and administrative controls and failure of such, and human factors will be addressed by the team performing the hazard analysis.  The findings and recommendations of the team are submitted to area management to assess the likelihood of the potential hazards, assess the severity of the consequences from potential releases, and assign priority for implementation of recommendations.  The recommendations and progress towards implementation is followed using a computerized tracking system.

The operating procedures are also maintained on-line on the ARCO LAR computer network.  \n\nThe operating procedures are reviewed by supervision before scheduled activities (e.g. scheduled start-ups and shutdowns, scheduled on-line maintenance) and when supervision believes that the current procedure should be modified to better execute the planned activities.  Critical procedures such as unit emergency procedures are reviewed annually during annual training sessions.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, ARCO LAR has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining a process.  Initial training for operating and maintenance personnel who are new to a process includes health and safety training, fundamentals of refining, process overview and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is given to operators assigned to an operating unit.  This training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the operator's job tasks.

Testing is also conducted on all OSHA-required safety and health training.  Employee training and certification records are documented, both in hard copy and computerized training records.\n\nContractors\n\nARCO LAR uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities, or to perform tasks requiring skills that are needed on a non-routine basis.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about refinery safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  Additionally, all contractors that work at LAR must have completed an 8-hour training program (Refinery Safety Orders) that provides a standardized baseline of safety and health training for all contractors that perform work at local area refineries.  Recertification to demonstrate knowledge of the required subject areas is required every two years.  In addition, ARCO LAR evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as one of the key criteria for selection of a contractor to perform work in the refinery.

ARCO LAR incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. Procedures are in place to ensure that new pressure vessels, piping systems, rotating equipment, storage tanks, instrumentation and control equipment, including spare parts are: 1) modified, repaired or fabricated to meet applicable codes; 2) meet design specifications and applicable codes; and 3) are inspected and checked for proper installation and consistency with specifications and manufacturer' instructions.  As part of this program, Positive Material Identification (PMI) is conducted, which involves physical testing to ensure that the correct metallurgy is received and installed as specified for both existing equipment, repair work, and new construction.\n\nSafe Work Permits\n\nARCO Los Angeles Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include 1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; 2) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (hot work permit); 3) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space; and 4) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n7 Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n7 Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n7 Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automatic)\n7 Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature\n7 Diking to contain liquid releases\n7 Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n7 Atmospheric pressure relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n7 Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n7 Trained emergency response personnel\n7 Personal protective equipment (protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe ARCO Los Angeles Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Due to proactive efforts to prevent accidents and a strong safety program, there have been no incidents in the past 5 years with onsite or offsite effects involving a release of ammonia or a regulated flammable material that meet the reporting criteria of the EPA RMP or Cal-AR"

      "SummaryText": "P Rules.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nARCO LAR has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including notification of emergency response agencies if a release occurs that could endanger the public or the environment and post-incident clean-up and decontamination procedures.  The plan includes or utilizes the following: 1) pre-emergency planning, including training, drills and reviews; 2) responsibilities for all employees involved in response, control, containment, notification, evacuation, etc.; 3) plans for evacuation to safe areas; 4) emergency traffic control and security; 5) weather monitoring through an on-site weather station (wind direction, wind speed) and visible wind socks; 6) emergency first aid and treatment.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the ARCO Los Angeles Refinery is coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meeting and program review as well as joint training opportunities during on-site training exercises and off-site fire and hazardous materials training schools.  LAR has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations, which provides a quick means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident.

      "SummaryText": "rgency drills are conducted that involve the local emergency response organizations, and training is provided to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances and other hazardous substances at the refinery.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe ARCO Los Angeles Refinery is committed to operating excellence in the way we conduct our business and the way we relate to the environment.  The company has implemented a system that provides a mechanism for self-assessment and a direction for continuous improvement within our operations.  As a result of this self-assessment, we are in the process of evaluating and strengthening our training programs for refinery supervision, and further strengthening our procedures for Management of Change.\n\nAs an example of this commitment with respect to the regulated chemicals at LAR, we have initiated a review to determine the feasibility of a change from anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia, which could lessen the offsite impact in the event of a release."
