The primary activity at this facility is the storage and loading of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers for direct application. The maximum quantity stored would be 56,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.                             The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.6 miles.                                                The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.                                                                                                            This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute,Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".                                                                                                                                                  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:                                 - have caused any injuries, deaths, or property damage; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shel"
