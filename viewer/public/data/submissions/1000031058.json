Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., Oklahoma City Division has the capability of holding 31,000 pounds in a single refrigeration system, which is above the threshold specified by OSHA and EPA.  Therefore, the Oklahoma City Division is required to comply with OSHA and EPA requirements.\n\n\n\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has conducted a dispersion analysis of a potential incident involving a release of anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant at the Oklahoma City Council Road Facility location.  The primary acitivities at the facitlity are receiving and distributing grocery related products, which necessitates the need for keeping perishable items cool or at freezing temperatures or below.  The results of this analysis are to be used by the Oklahoma City Council road facility in their emergency planning, response, and training activites.  An anhydrous ammonia dispersion analysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of a release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nTwo scenarios were developed for this analysis.  One scenario, considered the \"worst case\" event, is the loss of the total quantity of the largest vessel (12,665 pounds).  For the \"worst case\" event, the total charge of ammonia is to be released over a period of ten minutes.  \n\n\n\nThe other scenario, which is considered to be the \"alternative\" event, is the release of ammonia from a hole in a tank.  In this event, a release of 5980 pounds of ammonia is postulated to occur through a .25 inch diameter  hole, over a ten minute period of time.  \n\n\n\nFor the worst case scenario, it was determined that a release could travel approximately 1.5 miles.
