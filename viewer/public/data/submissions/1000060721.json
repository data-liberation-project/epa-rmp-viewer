Louisiana utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds) in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are fractionated into ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline products. Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\nThe Riverside Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Riverside Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM.\r\nThe Riverside Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor within the last five (5) years.  \r\nThe Riverside Plant employs 23 full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. EnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in January 2012 for the Riverside Plant and revised it on May 2014. The current RMP includes administrative updates associated w"

The closest public receptor (residential home) is approximately 0.17 miles (0.27 kilometers) from the gas plant in the analysis. In addition, the Riverside Plant is subject to OSHA PSM. Therefore, the Riverside Plant is classified as a Program 3 facility. The processes at the plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains five sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities: natural gas, unstabilized condensate, stabilized condensate, propane, natural gas liquids, and slop oil."
