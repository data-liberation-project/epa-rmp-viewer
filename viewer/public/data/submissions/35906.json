      "SummaryText": "The Westerville Water Plant disinfection process utilizes chlorine gas which is a regulated, extremely toxic substance.  The goal of this document is to minimize the risk to the public and employees from an accidential release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  This document was developed by our employees based on the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nWesterville Water Plant has utilized chlorine for over seventy five years with an excellent safety record.  Many design parameters, operational policies and training programs are in place to minimize any potential release of chlorine to the environment.  No releases are reported in this Risk Management Program's five year history, or in previous ones.  \n\nThe chlorine facilities are located in separate, isolated rooms to provide some containment and are equiped with monitors and a scrubber.  If a chlorine leak were to occur, an alarm would alert the operator and activate an automatic tank valve shut off device.  The operator's response would depend on the severity of the release.  Major releases would be responded to by the Fire Department, with minor leaks corrected following plant procedures.  \n\nThe water plant operating staff have performed a process hazard analysis and been trained in safety and plant procedures for handling of chlorine.  As a reslut of this review process, the following actions are planned: additional written procedures on chlorine handling, perform an vulnerablity assessment, preventive maintenance procedures and documentation of maintenance and inspection activities."
