We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve and maintain a safe workplace.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process. Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations. The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely. The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1969.\r\n\r\nOur corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence or minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia.  \r\n \r\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace as well as a quality environment. Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy. We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride s"

We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy. Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy. \r\n\r\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\r\n \r\nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We continually talk with local authorities in communities in which we operate to share ideas about preventing incidents with materials we use or store.\r\n\r\nAmmonia System\r\n \r\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality. The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped. Because of the characteristics of ammonia, our employees observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and in the surrounding community.\r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n \r\nAnheuser-Busc"

This experience has helped bring about designs and operating plans that produce a safe system. The following elements have produced this safe operating record:\r\n\r\nProcess hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\r\nStandard operating procedures that all operators of the refrigeration system must follow;\r\nFormal operator training (40 hours minimum); \r\nPreventative maintenance to ensure that the entire refrigeration system is mechanically sound; \r\nProcedures to ensure that changes to the refrigeration system are managed so ammonia flow remains safe; \r\nSafety review prior to the startup of new or modified equipment; \r\nAudits of the PSM and RMP programs; \r\nIncident investigations to ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future incidents; Employee involvement in risk reduction programs; \r\nContractor safety procedures are reviewed to ensure outside workers exercise the same safety consciousness as brewery employees; \r\nA work permit system that ensures all welding and working at heights work is conducted safely.\r\nProcess safety information; and Emergency Planning and Response.\r\n \r\nThe brewery additionally complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM standard (40 CFR 1910.119), the EPA RMP rules (40 CFR 68), and the ANSI/IIAR 2-2008 standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n  \r\nThe brewery has had no releases that have caused onsite or offsite injuries, or damage to property or the environment. In fact, the brewery has never had releases with these impacts since it began operation in 1969.\r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n \r\nThe Jacksonville brewery has in place a variety of emergency response procedures in the event of an incident involving ammonia. The emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (29 CFR 1910.38) and HA"

      "SummaryText": "ZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain an EHS Incident Plan which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department. The Department's Hazmat Team is periodically invited to tour the ammonia system to keep their personnel prepared to respond to an ammonia emergency at the Brewery.  \r\n\r\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\r\n \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n \r\nAnheuser-Busch's Jacksonville brewery ammonia refrigeration system is periodically modified to improve safety. In the late l990s, the ammonia refrigeration pressure relief valves were all inspected and upgraded, where necessary, in addition to the normal 5 year relief valve inspection program. In 2015, the Jacksonville Brewery completed a What If Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) of the entire ammonia system again using the most recent PHA process tools and techniques.  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAnheuser-Busch is pleased to share its record of safe operations with the citizens of Jacksonville. We believe the Risk Management Plan under which we are providing this information is an important tool for encouraging communications with our neighbors.  Although we are confident the worst case and alternative scenarios presented in this report are highly unlikely, we want you our neighbors to know we are prepared to respond quickly and effectively should one ever occur. Anheuser-Busch has worked hard over the years to ensure the highest standard of safety. Our goal is to continue the excellent and safe track record."
