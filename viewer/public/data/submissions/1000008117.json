The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses ammonia for reducing the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from its Haynes Generating Station (HNGS). Storing and handling large quantities of ammonia can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as it takes in power generation. The LADWP Haynes Generating Station ammonia handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency. LADWP prepared and submitted the original RMP for the Haynes Generating Station in June 1999 and this submittal is the third five-year update since the original RMP. The following information is specifically required in the \n\nRMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThe above information for the Haynes Generating Station is provided below.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and \n\nmanagement practices.

Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies (City of Long Beach Fire Department) to respond to any ammonia release that may occur at the HNGS facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nHaynes Generating Station is located in Long Beach, California. The HNGS is a gas-fired electricity generating facility that supplies electrical power to the LADWP system.  The facility has eleven power generating units that burn natural gas or diesel as back-up emergency fuel to produce steam to drive electric generator turbines. The total capacity of the plant is 1600 megawatts of electric power.  The facility is managed and operated around the clock. There is a minimum crew of ten operators and one shift supervisor.  On a normal day shift, there are approximately 168 on-site personnel including Operations, Technical, Maintenance, Clerical, and Warehouse staff.\n\n\n\nUnits 1, 2, and 9 through 16 are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a combustion byproduct that is a precursor to ozone. In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR, ammonia (NH3) gas, a reducing agent, is injected into the flue gas to react with NOx to form nitrogen gas (N2) and water vapor (H2O) according to the following chemical reactions:\n\n      \n\n   4 NH3   +   6 NO --> 5  N2   +   6 H2O\n\n   8 NH3   +   6 NO2 -->  7  N2   +   12 H2O\n\n   \n\nAmmonia Process Description\n\n\n\nThe ammonia solution storage and supply system (ammonia process) has the function \n\nof storing and delivering ammonia for injection for NOx emissions control in Units 1, 2, and 9 through 16.

Aqueous ammonia solution is used instead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards requiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing.  The risks and safety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.\n\n\n\nAmmonia solution is stored in aboveground tanks that are surrounded by a concrete\n\ncontainment system. A pump dispenses ammonia solution to the emission control equipment. Other safety equipment associated with these tanks are: pressure/vacuum relief valves, liquid level alarms, two ammonia vapor scrubbers, quick fill connections, vapor recovery and associated piping, eight strategically-located ammonia vapor detectors, three emergency eyewash/shower stations, three containment sumps equipped with normally closed drain valves, and water cannons to control ammonia vapor..\n\n\n\nAmmonia solution is delivered by truck that parks within a sloped containment area, \n\nwhich drains to a sump (unloading area sump). The solution unloading to the \n\nstorage tanks is done through a quick fill connection. A truck-mounted vapor recovery \n\nsystem is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading. The storage \n\ntanks are equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tanks are maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\n\n\nA redundant dispensing pump is placed into service when either the main pumps fails \n\nor are out of service for preventative maintenance.

The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader and the Plant Manager. The Compliance Audit Checklist details the requirements of each RMP element and contains questions that may assist with the auditing process. The audit checklist for each element consists of the following three sections:\n\n\n\n* Records Review: A review of the RMP written Prevention Program.\n\n* On-Site Conditions: The audit team reviews the program elements based on \n\nobservation of the plant conditions and safety practices.\n\n* Interviews:  The program elements are evaluated by interviewing personnel from \n\nappropriate functions including operations, maintenance, management, and contractors.\n\n\n\nTeam members record RMP program deficiencies identified during the audit on the \n\nchecklist.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe LADWP incident investigation procedures describe incident reporting, investigation, and investigation reporting steps to be followed by plant personnel.  The incident investigation is started promptly but no later than 48 hours after the event.  The \n\nLADWP promptly addresses and resolves all recommendations and implements the \n\nrecommendations in a timely manner to prevent an incident recurrence.  All incident \n\ninvestigation reports are retained on LADWP file for at least a period of five years from the date the reports are completed.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia gas or solution that meet the reporting \n\nrequirement of the EPAs RMP have occurred at this facility for the past five years (i.e. from June 2004 to June 2009).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\n\n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e HNGS facility is a non-responding facility, which means that the facility \n\nemployees will not respond to aqueous ammonia accidental release. Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies to respond to any aqueous ammonia release than may occur at the HNGS facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs part of the preparation of a Risk Management Program, a hazard review was \n\nperformed in June 2009 for the ammonia handling system. The hazard review was \n\nperformed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both \n\nequipment and procedures used for the ammonia handling system. The same hazard review will be conducted if there are any changes in the system that may have potential impacts on the environmental and nearby community.\n\n"
