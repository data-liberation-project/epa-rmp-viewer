We have written procedures and pre-plans and we conduct training for initial incident response, emergency responder contact, regulatory agency and community notifications, maintenance of emergency response equipment, and specific response management.  Furthermore, we actively participate in our Peoria County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) coordinating our plan with the Peoria County EMA community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have a trained emergency response team on site, and if necessary we coordinate with Timber Hollis Fire Department for handling larger emergency incidents.  Our emergency response team has incident command, fire, rescue, and Hazmat training and has conducted joint training and drills with the Peoria County EMA and neighboring industries.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nLonza subscribes to the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates (SOCMA) \"ChemStewards\" initiative, which provides for continuous improvements in all aspects of our safety, health, and environmental programs.
