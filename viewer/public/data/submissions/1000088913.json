The refrigeration process at this facility is comprised of two (2) independent ammonia refrigeration systems (East System/A and West System/B) both of which are closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration systems. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pumps or pressure differential to the production and process area Freezer Tunnels and Water Chillers for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the process equipment returns to recirculators and/or suction accumulators. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 130 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable high side working pressure is 250 psig.\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Lakeside Foods has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Lakeside Foods implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Lakeside Foods to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Random Lake, WI facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Lakeside Foods includes the following steps:\n\nWritten plans for"

      "SummaryText": "ponse Program\n\nLakeside Foods employees have not been trained in emergency response and will not respond to emergency ammonia releases; however, the system can be shut down by activating one of the EMERGENCY STOP (E-STOP) switches located outside the Engine Room doors. An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. Employees have been trained on how to use the plan and drills carried out annually.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Lakeside Foods, Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, Lakeside Foods is considering updating their emergency ventilation system, updating vessels, and installing additional eyewash/shower stations to fortify, an already robust, safety system. Lakeside Foods has recently completed updating their ammonia pressure relief systems and has invested a great amount of money and time into developing a PSM program. \n\n"
