The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCity of San Clemente Utilities Division maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facilities.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide systems occurred in 1974.  The processes are located at 350 Avenida Santa Margarita, San Clemente, California 92672.  The chlorine system for the Water Treatment Facility of City of San Clemente Utilities Division consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a maximum of two tanks on line through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the treatment processes.\n\nThe Water Treatment Facility's sulfur dioxide system is operated under vacuum conditions.  There is typically a one ton container and a 150 pound cylinder on-line.  The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that sulfur dioxide gas is pulled from the container. The flow of the water generates vacu"

Although, the one-ton containers are stored enclosed in a building at the Water Treatment Facility, the containers are unloaded from the delivery truck outside before being storing inside the building.  This creates the potential for operator error or equipment failure that would result in an unmitigated release, therefore, passive mitigation measures were not used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may affect both population and environmental receptors.\n\nNote: The scenario with the greatest impact on the surrounding community is designated as the \"worst case\" scenario.  However, the two chemicals, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, have the same farthest downwind distances at the Water Treatment Facility.  Therefore, since the maximum intended inventory for chlorine is higher than for sulfur dioxide, the chlorine release scenario will be used as the \"worst case\" scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nChlorine\n\n Scenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  Like the Water Reclamation Facility's alternate release scenario, the release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 14.6 pounds per minute.  However, passive mitigation measures were incorporated since the chlorine system is located inside an enclosed building at the Water Treatment Facility.  Consequently, the release rate a"

This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\n\n Scenario Description: A release of sulfur dioxide gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of sulfur dioxide due to the pressure of the tank is 7.0 pounds per minute.  However, passive mitigation measures were incorporated like the chlorine alternate release scenario.  Consequently, the release rate after these measures was calculated to be 3.8 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability. Reference table from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance for the toxic point of 3 ppm.  This release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No Environmental receptors were affected by the potential release scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCity of San Clemente Utilities Division has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a chlorine/sulfur dioxide gas detector in the storage room that is set at 1 ppm and will activate the visual/audible alarm, the scrubber system, shut off the ventilation system, and page the operator on duty.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe accident history researched back five years to June 1994 shows that the "

This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe City of San Clemente Utilities Division has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.

The PHA was comprised of one session that included a HAZOP study, a Plant Walkthrough, a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.  The changes will be completed by December 1, 1999.\n\nR02 Contact the vacuum regulator manufacturer to determine if the ventilation line  can be routed to the sensor inside the chlorine storage building.  Also determine whether this will cause the scrubber to turn on during every tank change.\n\nR03 Verify the maintenance and performance of the chlorine sensor with the scrubber system.  Include manufacturer's maintenance recommendation in the Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nR06 Install windsocks at both facilities to determine the wind direction.    \n\nR07 Label equipment to distinguish the chlorine and the sulfur dioxide systems.\n\nR08 Ensure both chlorine and sulfur dioxide sensors are connected to the scrubber system.\n\nR09 Include in the Mechanical Integrity procedures that a tag showing the replacement date for the flexible tubing be attached to the system tubing.\n\nR10 Ensure that the operators bring safety equipments from Water Reclamation Facility to the Water Treatment Facility in case of emergency and for every tank change out.\n\nR11 Confirm the maintenance and compatibility of the sulfur dioxide sensor with the scrubber system.\n\nR13 Complete the Human Factor Engineering checklist (Tables 5-2 and 5-3) at such time when the modification of both facilities is finished and the chlorine/sulfur dioxide systems are operational.\n\nR14 Review Emergency Response checklist (contained in Appendix C) after the completion of the facility's emergency response plan.\n\nSeismic Assessment\n\n1.
