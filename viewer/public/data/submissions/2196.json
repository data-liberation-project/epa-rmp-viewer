This decreases response time in the event of a release.\n\nAll containers are changed by two certified operators. Untrained operators are not allowed to connect or disconnect containers.\n\nThe manifold systems are of the vacuum demand type which shut off the container if there is a leak anywhere between the container and the chlorinator / sulfunator.\n\nIn the event of a chlorine / sulphur dioxide leak, the associated alarm system sounds in the laboratory, at the communication center, and start the auto dialer (for on-call personnel). The system does not convey the severity of the leak only that the leak is above the detection level of the sensor (3 mg/l).\n\nThe first person aware of any leak is responsible for notifying all plant personnel to evacuate the affected area(s) and calling 911.  If the leak is in the chlorine or sulfur dioxide building and it is safe to do so, the leak is to be contained by closing the doors ( if they are open) and turning off the ventilation system.  This minimizes exposure to plant personnel and gives the Emergency Services Co-ordinator time to get a response team on site to stop / repair the leak. A one ton repair kit is kept on site at all times.\n\nChlorine has a yellowish green appearance while Sulfur Dioxide is colorless and can be recognized by a pungent (sharp biting) odor.  Personnel are trained to take note of the wind direction via wind sock so as to move upwind of any leak and to be aware of the  corrosive nature (when wetted) with regard to the extensive damage that will ocur to metal structures and vehicles.\n\nThe wearing of the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus by personnel while changing containers is not to be confused with having training to enter a chlorine atmosphere to effect a repair.  Plant personnel do not have the training and / or the necessary equipment and could become a liability to the Town's insurance coverage.\n\nOn"
