(\"PG&E\")\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  PG&E's  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel and appropriate emergency personnel (when appropriate) will respond to control and contain the release to ensure the safety of our employees and the public.\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant, located on US Hwy 277 approximately 19 miles south of Sonora in Sutton County Texas, operates   processes to extract liquid petroleum products from the natural gas stream. This liquid product consist of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, which are regulated substances. In order to establish as safe an environment as possible for employees and the public, PG&E has elected to maintain minimum inventories (well below the threshold quantity) of toxic substances.    \n \n The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product surge tank containing 7800 lbs. of product in which ethane is the main constituent.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is  0.16 mile or 853 feet. Although PG&E has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive and/or active mitigation "

It is equipped with a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) or Relief Valve. The PSV and all other safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15 months. These tests are conducted as a part of the mechanical integrity element of PG&E's PSM program, which the plant has had in place for the past several years.  Ultrasonic testing is also performed on non-insulated piping and vessels in the plant to determine that the wall thickness of the piping and vessels is adequate for the service.\n \n The Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from the release of 150 lbs. of product, of which ethane is the main constituant which could result  from a packing failure at the product pumps.  Such a  release is expected to be isolated by an automatic shutdown valve within 5 minutes (active mitigation).  The valve would receive a signal to close from a gas detection system with monitors located in the pump area. The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this event is .04 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n \n The gas detection system, the automatic shutdown valve and other safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15-month intervals. These tests are conducted as a part of the mechanical integrity element of PG&E's PSM program, which has been in place for several years.\n \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program and how the 14 elements of the PSM standard are being addressed is included in the PSM Policy and Implementation Plan which is maintained at the  plant.  In addition, the gas plant has  initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include individual safety awards presented for safety excellence during the previous year.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant management is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is always readily available to the employees.\n \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in a Cause & Effect Dia"

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n The gas plant also maintains plant job books, Piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID's) and  Electrical Classification Drawings,  that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and training, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures may be necessary. \n \n The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) start-up following a turnaround or emergency shut down.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n \n In addition, the gas plant maintains a Cause and Effect Diagram that provides information on how each of the process equipment will react to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training  on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n Contractors\n \n The Sonora Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished prior to their beginning by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices.  In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
