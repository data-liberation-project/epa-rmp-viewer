DBA Voyant Beauty is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees, and the surrounding community. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (aerosol packaging) is designed, operated, and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to prevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to minimize releases if they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: \nAccra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty, located at 2730 Middlebury Street, Elkhart, Indiana, offers full service custom packaging for various consumer product industries, such as pharmaceutical, household, cosmetic, and personal care. The products packaged for these industries consist of liquids, semi-liquid creams, lotions, and aerosols. Some of the types of products that Accra-Pac, Inc. DBA Voyant Beauty process equipment includes propellant storage tanks, compounding tanks for blending ingredients, liquid filling, aerosol filling, packaging, and warehousing. \nDBA Voyant Beauty products include hair products, body sprays, shaving creams, household cleaners, etc.  Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the containers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. The propellants are stored in pressurize above ground storage tanks.  There are 21 propellant tanks located in the tank farm on the property.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan, the tank farm has been divided into 3 areas, Propellant Tank Farm A, B, and C, based on groups of tanks that would most likely be impacted should one tank have a fire.
