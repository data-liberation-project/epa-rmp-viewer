The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(1). The Prevention Porgram Elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) System prepared in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rico requirements. The disinfection process at the Puerto Nuevo RWWTP uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO and EQB. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Puerto Nuevo RWWTP observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Puerto Nuevo RWWTP and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency response program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Puerto Nuevo RWWTP outfall terminates in a high-rate diffuser located in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 3,600 feet offshore north of Isla de Cabras that discharges into the Atlantic Ocean. Chlorine is used to treat the water in order to eliminate objectionable odors.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in ton containers. Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators, a system that regulates vacuum and chlorine flow in the system.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program is composed of many elements and its objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment and the property.\n\n\n\nEmergency Respon"

Leak repair kits are maintained on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur. PRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAudits\n\n\n\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on September, 1, 2010. But during the past two years we have conducted internal metrics evaluations. With each internal metrics we request an action plan to correct the findings. PRASA has develop these metrics evaluation to establish the level of compliance of our facilities with the RMP/PSM Program."
