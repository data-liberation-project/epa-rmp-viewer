It should be reported that to my knowledge, there has never been an accidental release of chlorine at this facility since construction in 1984.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan for the Wastewater Treatment Plant is based on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Division of Emergency Management's Tab Q-7.  This plan is incorporated into the County's Emergency Response Plan for Simpson County by the LEPC.  This plan is periodically reviewed by the LEPC and updated by individual facilities.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nThis facility is very safety oriented and will continue to strive to improve safety measures where we can.  Through this procedure (RMP), we have identified areas that we must improve upon.  We will continue our safety meetings and place special emphasis on operational procedures regarding the use of Chlorine.  I am currently working with an Environmental Consulting Firm to schedule a current PHA.  I assume I can update the RMP at that time."

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Toxic Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the City of Franklin Wastewater Treatment Plant, chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the Chlorine Contact\nBasin.  The Chlorine is injected via water pressure to the head of the Chlorine Contact Basin.  We have only one tank (1 Ton Cylinder) hooked up to the process feeding approximately 20 lbs/day.  Chemical safety is of the utmost importance to this facility.  Safety measures are in use involving the handling and usage of chlorine and trying to comply with all state and federal laws and regulations.  Employees are trained on Chemical Safety and the proper procedures to follow for change-outs, precautionary measures, use of Scott Air Paks and other safety devices at their disposal.  An Emergency Response Plan is in place and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Service in the event of an accidental release.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nIncluded in the ERP are truck routes used by the Chlorine vendors that would be used in transporting Chlorine to this facility.  Access to any and all areas of this facility are restricted to authorized personnel only and authorized contractors.  Qualified personnel are on hand during loading and off-loading of Chlorine Cylinders.  The room used to house the Chlorine is separated by a solid brick wall that extends all the way to the top of the building, completely made of brick with a concrete floor.  Alarm systems are in place in the storage area plus additional alarms and analyzers located in the Administrative Building.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nIn a worst case scenario, chlorine gas would be released from the building using the model that was indicated under the Worst Case Scenario section of this RMP.  The total amount of chlorine that could be released under this scenario would be 2000 lbs. We would certainly hope that through administrative controls, mitigation measures and participation with LEP in mock disasters that we would be prepared for"
