This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. EnLink's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Lobo Gas Processing Facility for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Lobo Gas Processing Facility inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable. The facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant utilizing three trains that are designed to process natural gas. Plant 1 is designed for 35 MMSCFD, Plant 2 is designed for 150 MMSCFD, and Plant 3 is designed for 200 MMSCFD. Plant 3 connects Plants 1 and 2 making one overall covered process. The facility consists of inlet gas, separation and filtration, dehydration, condensate stabilization, amine treatment units, cryogenic processing units, refrigeration systems, flash gas compression, residue compression, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in three 400-barrel tanks and three 1000- barrel tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent "

The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture.\n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Lobo Gas Processing Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility. \n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features \n\n\n\nThe Lobo Gas Processing Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n2. High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n3. Facility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Berms around tanks\n\n2. Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process\n\ncontrol system)\n\n6. Total plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n3. SPCC Plan\n\n4.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The overall emergency response program for the Lobo Gas Processing Facility is coordinated with the Loving County LEPC. The Loving County LEPC can be reached at (915) 377-2362. The Lobo Gas Processing Facility has around-the-clock communications capability. In the event of an emergency, the operator will call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Mentone Orla Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. EnLink conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Lobo Gas Processing Facility offers training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Lobo Gas Processing F"
