The refrigeration process at this facility is comprised of two (2) independent ammonia refrigeration systems (North System and South System) both of which are closed-loop, two-stage, mechanical refrigeration systems. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pumps or pressure differential to the production and process area evaporators for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to recirculators and/or suction accumulators. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 125 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable high side working pressure is 250 psig. \n\nAs part of the PSM program, Echo Lake Foods has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Echo Lake Foods implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Echo Lake Foods to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Franksville, WI facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Echo Lake Foods includes the following steps:\n\nWritte"

An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. Employees have been trained on how to use the plan and drills carried out annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Echo Lake Foods, Inc. regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety. Currently, there are no changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n"
