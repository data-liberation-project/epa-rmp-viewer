For safety and environmental incidents, the policies could be summarized as follows:\n\n  -We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\n  -Our goal for incidents is zero.\n  -We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide leadership for our local communities to \n    help in their emergency preparedness.\n\nCorporate policies are embodied in numerous Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) manuals as well as DuPont Engineering Standards.\n\nAt Washington Works, SHE policies and procedures are also documented in the Washington Works SHE Manual.  Various procedures throughout the manual deal specifically with Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring.  It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor working on our behalf to comply with these procedures.  It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures. \n\nIf an emergency were to occur due to a release, the response program for the site is documented in the Washington Works Emergency Control Organization (ECO) Manual.\n\nBoth the Washington Works SHE and ECO manuals are available for review by all employees.\n\nFacility Description\n\n The DuPont Washington Works site consists of approximately 2000 acres located 5 miles south of Parkersburg, WV.  In addition to manufacturing areas and associated support facilities, the site also has areas dedicated to wildlife habitat and a local historic landmark that the site leases to the state for use by the public.  \n\n The site uses the following EPA regulated chemicals at levels above their threshold quantities:\n\n Toxics\n formaldehyde\n hydrochloric acid\n\n Flammables\n tetrafluoroethylene\n\nIn 2003, Washington Works implemented a program to use Sodium Hypochlorite as a disinfecting agent instead of chlorine.

Washington Works deferred reporting the removal of Chlorine from our facilities until now to insure that the facilities could operate within the permitted discharge parameters using Sodium Hypochlorite during the winter season.  Sodium Hypochlorite allowed the facilities to operate within the required parameters.\n\nIn April 2004, Washington Works shut down the facility that uses Ethylene.  The Site does not plan to restart this facility.  Therefore, Ethylene has been removed from the Flammables list.  As a result of this activity, the Worst Case and Alternate Scenarios for a flammable release have been modified.  Both scenarios now use Tetrafluoroethylene.\n\nWashington Works has also modified its Alternate Toxic Release Scenario for Formaldehyde.  The Site has identified an alternative release scenario that changed the distance to end point.  \n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau Landview* 5 Software program was used to determine the estimated residential population within distance to endpoint for each scenario.\n  \nWorst-case Toxic Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario for the Washington Works site involves the release of a storage tank containing hydrochloric acid with no mitigation assumed.  The release has off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided software (RMP*Comp).  \n\n This release is highly unlikely due to the tank's materials of construction, periodic vessel inspections, and available de-inventorying capacity in the case of an emergency.\n\n Worst-case Flammable Release Scenario\n\n The worst-case flammable release scenario for the Washington Works site involves the release of Tetrafluoroethylene from a failed Tank. The release has minimal off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided software (RMP*Comp).    Based on the results and location of the Tank, no residences are within the area of impact.\n\n The release of the Tank contents is highly unlikely due to the des"

One from each identified process.  The chemicals involved include hydrochloric acid and formaldehyde. The scenarios use the best engineering judgement as to a more likely scenario for the processes involved with no mitigating factors to minimize their impact.  The meteorological conditions are those given in the EPA Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual for alternate release scenarios.  Both scenarios have off-site impact as determined by the RMP*Comp software.\n\nThe release from the formaldehyde manufacturing area involves release of material through a leak in an above ground process line.  The release from the Acetal Resin Manufacturing area involves release of material via a safety relief device due to high pressure that subsequently become stuck in the open position for a short period of time.   \n\nFor hydrochloric acid, the release involves the failure of a transfer hose on a shipping trailer.\n\nAlternative Flammable Release Scenario\n\n The alternative flammable release scenario developed for the Washington Works site involves Tetrafluoroethylene being released via a failure of the tank nozzle.  The release has no off-site impact as determined by using EPA provided software (RMP*Comp).  \n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n The Washington Works site manufacturing areas follow the requirements set out in DuPont Corporate SHE Standard S21A, Process Safety Management.  This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.
