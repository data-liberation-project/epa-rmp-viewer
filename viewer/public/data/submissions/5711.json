Companys Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\n\nThe Company has coordinated its emergency response plan with the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Carolina, P.R. and the local Fire Department.  In addition the Company maintains an open contract  with a qualified emergency response contractor to handle emergencies involving hazardous materials.\n\n\nII.  Description of the Stationary Source\n\n7 The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst and surfactants.  The resultant polymeric network is expanded with carbon dioxide formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n7 The facility stores and uses quantities of toluene diisocyanate in excess of the threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR 68.115.\n7 The TDI is stored as follows:\n\n7 two 9,500 gallons above ground storage tanks located inside a dike and sheltered.  \n\n7 TDI is pumped from the various tanks to the production line where it is mixed with other chemicals and reacts to form the polyurethane foam.\n\n\nIII.  Description of the worst-case release\n\nThe worst case release analyzed was the loss of the entire content of a 9,500 gallon TDI storage tank into a 475 square feet dike.  The distance to the end point was 12 yards as determined using the ALOHA version 5.2 model.  This does not impact a public receptor.  Tech Aerofoam determined that the worst case will be from the 9,500 gallons storage tank.\n\n\nIV.  Description of general prevention program\n\n    None is required.\n\nThe actions taken at the facility to prevent accidental releases includes the following:\n\n7 Periodic inspections of lines, pumps, tanks, valves\n7 manual inspection of level indicators prior to loading of the tanks to prevent overfilling\n7 storage tanks are sheltered to prevent corrosion a protect them from accidental rupturing\n7 storage tanks are all diked with concrete floors\n\nV.  Description of Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental release of TDI fro"
