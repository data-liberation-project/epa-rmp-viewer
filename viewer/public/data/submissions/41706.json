The facility is approximately 114,000 sq.ft. in area.  We are also located in a zoned industrial area.  Our process area is divided into two separate areas.  One being the process building housing the tank farm.  This area is fully enclosed by a dike.  The second process area is a separate building, fully contained, with it\u00bfs own processing procedures. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\t\tTOXICS \u00bf Toluene Diisocyante\n\t\tFLAMMABLES \u00bf None\n\nOur accident release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\nIredell Fiber takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
