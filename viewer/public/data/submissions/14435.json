      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Medora FS Inc. are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental \nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire \ndepartment, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact \nof the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for \nsale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for \ndirect application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to \nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \ncontractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be \n120,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank as limited by design standards. \n \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a \nrelease from a break in a transfer hose.\n  \nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19\nmiles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \napplicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions \nof Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-\n61.1, published by The American National Standards Insti"
