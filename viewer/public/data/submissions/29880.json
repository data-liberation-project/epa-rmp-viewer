We shall as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Brenham believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidential releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidential releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be \"absorbed, neutrilized or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\".\n\nThe City has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.  The training includes classroom and hands on training on the proper use of e"
