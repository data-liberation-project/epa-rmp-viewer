It is our policy to adhere with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency,, our policy is to notify the Lexington Fire Department and request them to respond to the emergency.\nThe facility is a retail propane facility.  Propane is stored in a 30,000 gallon propane tank.  The propane is delivered from this tank to our customers via propane delivery trucks.  There is a transport un-load rack in addition to a load rack for delivery vehicles.  Bumper posts are located at both racks to protect from vehicle impact.  Automatic shut-off valves are located at transfer piping hook-up areas to mitigate releases caused by a pull away incident. \nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of our 30,000 gallon tank when filled to maximum capacity (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According  to look-up tables, the distance to 1 psi endpoint is .4 miles.  The residential population, according to census data, is 31 people within the 1 psi endpoint.  There are 12 commercial areas within the 1 psi endpoint.\nThe facility complies with EPA\u0012s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA \u0016 58 and state law.\nRockbridge Farmer\u0012s Coop has never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, or evacuati"
