The amount of chlorine in the wastewater is carefully controlled using computerized controllers, monitors and continuously supervised by certified operators. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe toxicity of chlorine at high concentrations make it necessary for the City to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle toxic chemicals including equipment design and safe handling procedures used to operate the equipment.  The City's release prevention program is based on four principles; inherently safe design, effective written procedures, training, and the goal of continuous improvement.  The chlorine storage and handing equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards as well as incorporating good engineering practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.  Written operating and maintenance procedures are prepared and reviewed annually for accuracy and safety.  Operating and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on proper procedures and safety hazards, and are provided with regular refresher training.\n\n\n\nThe City has developed a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.
