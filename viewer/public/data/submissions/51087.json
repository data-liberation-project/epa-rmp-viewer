The facility maintains a Freezer, Cooler & Dry storage area of nearly 4 million cubic ft. which is used to store perishable products.  Freezer, Cooler and Dry storage areas at the facility operate at -15\u00b0F to +70\u00b0F.  The facility has approximately nine truck loading and unloading spots and four railcar spots as well as an additional five railcar siding to aid in the transportation of products.  .  In order to maintain desired temperatures, a mechanical refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant is employed.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various Mechanical and Building Codes in effect at the time of construction.  These codes and guidelines outline requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems\n\nSAFETY FEATURES:  The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Safeties include but are not limited to pressure relief valves, stop valves, ammonia detectors, a computerized refrigeration monitoring and control system, as well as trained and experienced operators.  Much of the safety associated with the system, is also inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nMANAGEMENT\u00bfS COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:  Management takes safety very seriously and mandates that the facility maintain a safe working environment for employees, visitors, neighbors, and products at all times.

All deficiencies are noted and addressed in a timely manner.  (13) Incident Investigations are performed on accidental ammonia releases as well as near-misses.  Investigations are utilized to improve employee actions during an emergency. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no reportable ammonia related accidents, incidents or releases at the facility during 2002 - 2007.  \n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM:  The facility has established an Emergency Action Plan. The Plan explains what actions employees, contractor employees, and visitors are to take in the event of an emergency which include steps to take in the event of a fire, earthquake, tornado, etc. \nThe Emergency Action Plan states that all employees shall: \n1)\tNotify a supervisor or main office personnel to begin the facility evacuation by activating the public announcement (PA) system.\n2)\tNotify the appropriate emergency responders. \n3)\tNotify on-site contractors or visitors to evacuate the building. \n4)\tAssist in a safe and orderly evacuation. \n5)\tGather at the designated assembly area(s) for a head count.  \n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, employees are instructed to follow the steps as noted above.

Employee Participation:  Employees such as the Chief Engineer, Assistant Engineer, Engineering Supervisors and Management are actively involved in the development and implementation of PSM and RMP programs.  Employees aid in gathering Process Safety Information, development and implementation of Operating Procedures, are members of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), aiding in the completion of recommendations from both PHA and Compliance Audits, screening process for hiring Contractors, \n\n2. Process Safety Information: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) have been developed where all piping and major components of the ammonia refrigeration system have been noted and assigned an identifier. Information has been gathered to enable employees to identify and understand the potential hazards of the system. The process safety information includes the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.  An ammonia inventory is collected and retained in the PSI Library.  Relief Valves are identified and labeled.  Equipment within the system is operated within the good engineering practices.  \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis: A formal study of the ammonia refrigeration system with Management, Safety, and Maintenance personnel was conducted using the HAZOP method to evaluate the potential hazards of the system.  A recommendation summary is used to track completion of all recommendations. \n\n4.
