This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant is located at 2357 Standard Avenue, Whiting, Indiana.  The plant is owned by INEOS Oligomers a division of INEOS USA LLC.  Various grades of polybutene are processed to produce materials for use in the following products:\n\n\n\n* Adhesives\n\n* Caulk & Sealants\n\n* Cling Films\n\n* Coatings\n\n* Resin Plasticizer\n\n* Asphalt & Rubber Modifier\n\n* Electrical Insulation\n\n* Motor Oils & Lubricants\n\n* Rolling & Drawing Oils\n\n* Leather Impregnants\n\n* Soap-based gels/greases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Regulated substances at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity are:\n\n\n\nChemical                                              \nCAS No.\n2-Methylpropene  [1-Propene, 2-methyl-]\n115-11-7\n1-Pentene                                            \n109-67-1\nIsopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-]            \n78-78-4\n2-Butene-cis                                          \n590-18-1\n2-Butene-trans  [2-Butene, (E)]                \n624-64-6\nButane\n106-97-8                                               \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl]              \n75-28-5\nPropylene  [1-Propene]                           \n115-07-1\nPropane                 "

The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the Butane-Butylene (BB) Storage Sphere, or 3,840,000 lbs of BB?s, resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effects of a VCE.  Distances to the endpoint were calculated using the methodology outlined in EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Nearby public receptors could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.  The toxic WCS is not applicable to this plant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from the release of a BB mixture from a flange leak.  The release is expected to be isolated by operators within 10-15 minutes. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.  An alternative release scenario for toxic substances is not pertinent to this plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant encourages employees to participate in "

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Examples of these teams are the plant Safety, Health and Environmental Committee and Union/Management Health & Safety Committee.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessa"

These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are also spot audited on a semi-annual basis for compliance with our ISO 9000 Quality Program.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n  \n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant uses contractors to supplement its work force for maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergenc"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  In addition, the INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n  \n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n  \n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant has a hot work permit program which details those areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\n  \n\nThe INEOS Whiting Polybutene plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   Our incident investigation system is based on total employee involvement.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
