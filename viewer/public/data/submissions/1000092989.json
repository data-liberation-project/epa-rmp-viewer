The process safety information was also used in the development of the operating procedures.   \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \r\nComprehensive studies were conducted to ensure that hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration process were identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses was the what-if/checklist approach.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner. &#8195;\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: \r\nOperating procedures are maintained at the facility.  These procedures address the various modes of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process. \r\n\r\nTraining: \r\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least once every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: \r\nDocumented maintenance checks are conducted on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined during these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with current training in maintenance practices.  Fu"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modifications. \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews: \r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification of established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: \r\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least once every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: \r\nIncidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance are promptly investigated.
