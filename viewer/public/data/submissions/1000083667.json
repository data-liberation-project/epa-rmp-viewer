The recommendations from that PHA have been scheduled for resolution. In December 2018 and November 2019, a PHA for the aqueous ammonia system was conducted and all recommendations have been completed and resolved.\r\n \r\n\r\nPlanned changes as a result of the recent PHA include:\r\n\r\n1. Minor improvements in the Process Safety Information and the Maintenance Program.\r\n2. Revalidation of prior seismic analyses for Cold Storage and Production Systems.\r\n3. Conducting Mechanical Integrity Audit (MIA) for Production and Cold Storage Systems.\r\n4. Review of detector test requirements and need for installation of additional detection.\r\n5. Consideration of backup power for detection and ventilation for Production and Cold Storage Systems.\r\n6. Evaluate efficiency of communication methods for those on site.\r\n7. Minor modifications to the Emergency Response Procedures."

Contractors that perform maintenance or that design changes to the system will be qualified by the facility based upon their experience and safety record before being selected to provide such services.\r\n\r\nThe general safety program includes hazardous communication, forklift operation, first aid, emergency response, and additional programs as necessary to maintain a safe operation.\r\n\r\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no releases of ammonia from this facility in the last five years.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained to understand the requirements of the Emergency Response Plan.

The Plan includes notification and evacuation protocols.\r\n\r\nThere is an oil pot at the recirculator for the Cold Storage System and the oil pot vessel is equipped with a self-closing, spring-loaded drain valve for safety.  Oil is drained from the Production System through the plate and frame chillers, which also have self-closing, spring-loaded valves.  Oil from the Production 2013 System is drained through oil pots at the accumulator and surge drums.  All pressure vessels in the systems have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's on the Cold Storage System and Production 2013 System relieve to a respective  ammonia diffusion tank via a common discharge piping system.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain efficient refrigeration processes. The bulk Aqua Ammonia will vent to atmosphere.\r\n\r\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof and the evaporators are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line at the Cold Storage and Production systems.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes an aqueous ammonia injection process which is used to control the pH level in starter cultures in three starter rooms as part of the cheese making process.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nHilmar Cheese Company uses anhydrous ammonia for three (3) refrigeration systems for the production and cold storage of cheese products and for chilled water, and one (1) aqueous ammonia process which is used to control the pH level in starter cultures.  Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program or federal RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\r\n\r\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of a release, or impending release, of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to"
