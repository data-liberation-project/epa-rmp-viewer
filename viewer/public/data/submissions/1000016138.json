Policies and procedures are in-place to assist the staff with compliance with applicable hazardous materials rules and regulations. The Process Safety Management (PSM) Team at the facility is responsible to ensure appropriate procedures and safety measures are in-place to protect our employees and the surrounding community. The PSM Team is comprised of the Distribution Center Director, Maintenance Manager, Safety Coordinator with assistance from the Senior Director Facility Services Engineer, Corporate Environmental, Health & Safety Manager and from the outside refrigeration contractor.\n\n    The facility is located in a commercial/residential area in the northeast part of the  Columbus/Midland metro area. The facility consists of a warehouse house/distribution center for dry and frozen grocery products. The main warehousing facility is approximately 430,000 square feet and the property is approximately 109 acres in size.  The area around the facility consists of some commercial businesses and open space. The terrain is mostly flat, heavily forested. The facility is characterized by paved areas of asphalt and concrete around the facility along with outer areas that are heavily forested. The area north of the site includes a railroad corridor, State Highway 80 and residential properties north of the highway. The area east of the site is mostly comprised of undeveloped property. The Fort Benning Military Reservation is located south of the property and a Fed-X commercial facility is located west of the site.\n    \n    Nash Finch Columbus receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to military commissaries in the Columbus area, central Alabama as well as other nearby states. Grocery products include dry goods, frozen products as well as meat and other perisha"

Truck maintenance activities are performed by outside contractors off of the premises. The facility is connected to city water and sewer services.\n    \n    Hours of operation are up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Personnel at the facility include a distribution center director plus administrative staff, warehouse staff and truck drivers. Headcount at the facility is approximately 80 associates (warehouse staff and drivers).\n\nPart of the facility is a cold storage warehouse for the storage of frozen and perishable food products. The refrigeration for this part of the facility is provided by an ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia system contains approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. In this system, ammonia is the heat transfer medium that is compressed, cooled through the use of evaporative condensers and distributed to cooling evaporators throughout the ammonia refrigerated parts of the facility to maintain appropriate temperatures for the products stored in each area.\n\nBecause of the use of hazardous materials on-site, the facility is regulated by federal and state hazardous material rules and regulations. The ammonia, diesel fuel and sulfuric acid (used in powered industrial truck batteries) are regulated under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. The above ground use of petroleum products is regulated under Oil Pollution Prevention requirements (40 CFR Part 112) and as a result, the facility has a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68). The facility has also registered with the Department of Homeland Security since its ammonia quantity exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for registration (6 CFR Part 27).\n\nFrom an occupational safety and health perspective t"

Other OSHA rules such as lockout tagout, fall protection, confined space; powered industrial trucks, etc. also apply to the facility. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the process presenting the most risk to our employees and the surrounding community. Safe guards in the form of computer control systems employing sensors and interlocks to shutdown the system in the event of an equipment malfunction or release of ammonia are built into the system. Alarm sensors are placed within the ammonia engine room (processing center) and throughout the facility to alert plant staff of any ammonia releases within the facility. Detailed emergency plans and procedures are in-place to warn our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a release. \n\nSince this is the initial start-up of the ammonia refrigeration system, there have been no ammonia releases from the facility. Incident investigation procedures are in-place to ensure any potential future release is thoroughly investigated to determine the A?root causeA? of the incident and to ensure appropriate corrective action is implemented quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe facility has a detailed emergency response program to handle fire, ammonia releases or natural disasters. All employees receive training during new hire orientation sessions and periodic refresher training to ensure they understand the facility emergency response procedures. Attachments to Part 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan provide detailed coverage of potential ammonia release scenarios and the appropriate actions in response to those scenarios. In the event of an ammonia release, the employees are provided information over the facility public address system as to the nature of the release and instructions where they should assemble.

Nash Finch Columbus employees are not trained to respond to ammonia releases and are instructed to evacuate from the affected areas and leave emergency response to the local authorities. The fire department periodically visits the facility to ensure they are familiar with the physical structure and the hazards related to the chemicals used on-site.\n\n"
